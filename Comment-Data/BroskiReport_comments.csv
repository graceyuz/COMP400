We have real problems and issues going on and you get deemed a villain for being as you said patriotic for a country you love.

0,I was a GM at a Jersey Mike’s store in Houston when I was 19. Used to hyperventilate of overstimulation in the freezer (not the walk-in) during the lunch rush. Sliced my thumb absolutely open while I was shredding lettuce on the deli slicer alone one morning. One employee was fired and then broke in at night to rob the till lmao I miss those philly cheesesteaks and turkey subs. The radio used to play Rome by Snowmine which to this day soothes my wretched soul. Hated when they would play Cheeseburger in Paradise. I’m vegan now. Have a nice day.

Orwell brought out a point about change that was also spoken by Pitirim Sorokin in his book ""Sociology of a Revolution"" about what really acts as a cause for effect when speaking about the revolution. I advise you look into it, you'll most likely find it a good read ;)"

0,"The irony of adding that George Orwell book to my Amazon cart is not lost on me, but I did. Can’t wait to read it. It blows my mind reading about this stuff from the WW1-WW2 era that basically could have been written this year. I remember a month or so after October 7th I read an article about atrocity propaganda from WW1, and some research into how no method of dehumanizing people was anywhere near as effective a justification for genocide as “look what they’ve done to us, they will do it again if we don’t stop them”, and I had this awful, sinking, entirely correct feeling about what was going to happen. Something something time is a flat circle.

So I feel torn in half in such a similar way to what you describe, and I’m trying to have hope. I’m trying to find the right balance between holding myself accountable for what I CAN do and forgiving myself for what I can’t, and trying to identify the line where staying informed seeps over into rumination or outright traumatizing myself. It’s tough, but I’m glad to know a lot of us are kinda going through it together. ❤"

1,"I don’t comment on videos all too much, nor about my personal circumstances, but Brittany’s discussion about the body was really wonderful. As someone who was the size of and WEIGHT of a 10 year old - AT NINETEEN - less than a year ago due to an eating disorder, I CANNOT say enough how AMAZING it is to be alive. To live in the body I have. What the FUCK do you mean my body kept going when I didn’t feed it? When I tried to suffocate it slowly? A miracle. Everyday, I wake up, I walk, I talk, I go outside and smell the fresh fucking air. A PRIVILEGE I’m so SO lucky to have - my body. How incredible are we humans? Incredible. I try harder and harder every single fucking day to reverse the damage I’ve done, and to LIVE. And you know what? I’m happier than ever. FUCK standards!!"

0,"I don't think social media itself is evil I just think the way we use it is. I kind of tried to create a way of using it that helps me connect with the people I love and not with the people I compare myself to. Basically I unfollowed and removed any people who weren't on my close friends list so I could actually be myself on my account. Obviously I switched my account to private too. I have 3 followers because I have 3 close friends and I never think twice about whether or not I look good when I post now - they know me and they don't fucking care lol. Then I followed a bunch of nature photographers and art accounts so my home and explore page are now just full of nature and art. These subjects aren't addictive and now my screen time has gone down from about 8 hours a day to 2-3. At the end of the day it's about how much you really want to escape but it really is something everyone should want for themselves. Your local tv, radio, organisations and people will see you for who you are and not what you could be. Your desire to grow will come from the reflections you are forced to have when your mind isn't occupied by brainrot and overstimulation. Sit by a body of water and start there"

0,"Ads are so so annoying but you know whats worse? SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, you touched on the new 'oh pay more for ad free' subscriptions but I think its ridiculous just how many subscription services there are. To access most movies without pirating you need a subscription, to listen to a wide range of music whenever without having youtube permanently open and without ads you need a subscription, and these are fine I understand these businesses have to make money, although I don't excuse the subscription with ads. But the most absolutely bonkers subscription I've found is connected to my parents new car. We had to get a new car due to our old one being totaled and you can't get anywhere without a car anymore, a gripe for another time, so we get a car from 2024. We got a good deal on it so we got it. We're looking at all the new tech in the car and we go to connect it to the garage door, and we notice there is not a garage door opener where it usually is. Most modern cars have this so we think maybe the button is in a weird place, but no. There is no door opener, YOU HAVE TO GET A SUBSCRIPTION FOR 20 DOLLARS A MONTH TO HAVE THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER. I'm going insane and I'm sorry for the rant but the ad tangent made me go off on my own tangent, sorry to anyone who reads this. I am just so done with corporate greed."

Nothing worked obviously. There was a point where i thought to myself, ""If only they had a vidoe of how they wash it in the shower. That's gotta be where im doing it wrong."" And i was frustrated to the point of hating my own hair. I ordered a relaxer, fucked of my curls, and gave up. Months later I look on Insta and the model has a buzzcut. Im like ""NOOOO HIS CURLS WERE SO GOOD WHY WOULD HE THROUGH THEM AWAAY?!??!""................... he didnt throw them away, his curls were on a mannequin head behind him because it was a wig the whole fucking time"

1,I've always been picked on for my forehead and it's always been the most ANNOYING boys in my class to say something about it. It's never made sense to me because it's not like they HAVE to say that or they HAVE to spend the rest of their lives with me. After school we won't have to see each other ever again so why are you acting like it matters?? You don't have to like me if you don't want to I DO NOT CAREEEE.

1,"Pinterest is my FAVORITE but yeah the ads were driving me absolutely berserk. I installed an ad blocker and it's made scrolling so much more bearable!! It's called ""Pinterest Ads & Promo Remover"" and it's available in the Chrome web store. AND IT'S FREE. It basically just replaces the ads with blank tiles, but I'd rather look at the blank tiles than dozens of ads every few scrolls."
2,"honestly with the body representation online and advertising part i think that we all should be looking inwards at how much we allow our addictions to get the better of us, this is a people problem that if you follow it then you are actively teaching the next generation how to hate themselves and coming from someone who is bigger and learned to fight against the online prejudices, you are worth every bit of love from yourself, others and just from anyfuckingwhere in general, you dont have to prove to anyone that you are deserving of love"

0,"also! something else i personally think about is how genuinely nothing is real for us. i’m not saying it in a “we’re in a matrix” typa way, but how we have literally created social norms and everything around us. we decided we needed to create language, cultures, homes, random standards. like NOTHING, unless it is naturally occurring, usually has a “rule.” but the one thing that really IRKS me is beauty standards. literally we all look different and come from places in the world, but why do we decide when someone looks “bad” or has “bad features?” it’s not real. there is NO written, unbreakable rule on how you are supposed to look. it is ALL made up. i know a lot of our behaviors are apart of social norms and evolution but if you really look between the lines, you have so much power over what you decide is important and REAL to YOU."

I also appreciated the bit about Anxiety and Dermatillomania, from someone who's got it good and has severe facial + bodily scarring due to it. Anxiety of that nature can be such a beast to wrangle, but you speaking about it made me feel seen and I wholly empathize with you and send you love.

It's my stimm that I get to call my own and I call it having gargoyle time when I go at it.

As someone who got acne in my 20s, and experienced a traumatic event over the past few years that got me diagnosed w PTSD, my skin picking has unfortunately turned into a way to release anxiety. i space out, disassociate, and then however long later, look in the mirror with such guilt that i just harmed my skin. its a struggle but theres ways to try to curb it. its why ive taken up on crocheting to keep my hands and fingers busy instead. though, its still tough. always here for anyone suffering the same or similar 🫂 any advice is also welcome!"

0,Thank you for being so vulnerable about your struggles with skin picking. I feel seen.
0,24:53 the other thing about streaming ads is that it is the SAME 2-3 ads over and over and over. Sometimes the same ad twice in a row. At least cable had variety! The eye rolls my partner and I do watching the same ad twice in a row and then 4 separate times during one episode of a show is crazy.

0,I love you for this episode ❤️ it’s a reminder to love ourselves when we so often don’t. And we need to get everyone off the diet/thin culture. My goal for my body is to be strong and have mobility for the sake of playing with my kids safely (and not get hurt like before). I stopped wearing makeup unless it’s for me. I try to stop comparing myself to others ESPECIALLY online cause I see how people I know manipulate to make it look like they’re always out doing something

0,"Oh my gosh Brittany, I really highly recommend Twenty Øne Piløts to you. I honestly think you could grow to love their music or AT LEAST appreciate their lore and story. I love your videos and we share a lot of obsessions and you appreciate the deeper side of art and music and I just keep thinking how much you would just love their music.

They don’t just make music, they build these crazy conceptual worlds. Albums like Blurryface, Trench, and Scaled and Icy have all  these alter-egos, symbolic colors, characters(like Clancy), and hidden messages woven through the lyrics, MVs, costumes and even in their live performances.

Like, in Blurryface, Tyler created a character named Blurryface who represents his insecurity and self-doubt. When he paints his hands and neck black during performances, it symbolizes Blurryface taking control. And then you start to question stuff like ""Wait is this Tyler saying this line? Or Blurryface?"" It's so goooood😭

And it gets even deeper in Trench. That album introduces this dystopian city called Dema, which is ruled by these creepy bishop-like figures who trap people in cycles of fear and control. Tyler’s character tries to escape and joins a rebellion called the Banditos and the whole thing is a metaphor for fighting depression, manipulation, and emotional oppression.

Even Scaled and Icy, when this album came out everyone was like ""Wtf is this happy clownery lol"" BUT THEN YOU REALISE ITS PROPAGANDA CREATED BY THE VILLAINS IN DEMA WHO FCKN CAPTURED THE BAND!! And as you go through the albums you always always always end up finding out new shit LIKE WHEN YOU MIX UP ""SCALED AND ICE"" IT SAYS ""CLANCY IS DEAD"" LIKE BROOOOO😱

It’s been enough to keep me obsessed for like the past nine years now. I Sherlock Holmes that shit, and I swear it’s worth diving into."

0,the bj boone analysis is REALLL
1,"THERE’S A WAY TO REMOVE ADS ON PINTEREST!!! 

- Press and hold on an ad 
- go to hide (the eye icon)
- then press “it’s irrelevant to me.” 
- Repeat that for 5 ads then exit the app and close it entirely. 

Boom done no more ads. 
Sometimes they’ll come back after a few days but just repeat the process and ur good again."
0,"Hi bestie. I think you’d really like the article “As Much Truth As One Can Bear” by James Baldwin. My students read it during our Orwell/Animal Farm unit because it ties in well with the whole philosophy of why Orwell writes and what the job of an author truly ought to be (but for this article, within the context of the Civil Rights Movement and Baldwin’s own personal views on American society). It’s short but good!!"
0,"22:55 I was so annoyed by all the Pinterest ads too. What you can do is click the little three dots, then click “hide” on 5-6 pins. Then leave the app and come back in. All the ads will be gone for the time being. Saved my sanity"
0,"I have excoriation disorder as well (it’s in the family of body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders like trichotillomania as well) and CAN I JUST SAY it isn’t spoken about enough. Thank you for giving it space on your platform. Some of the treatments I’ve done include DBT and distress tolerance. If anyone else is reading this and experiencing this, google BFRB disorders and seek treatment. One helpful distress tolerance method I use is making super tight fists when I feel triggered, until the thoughts go away."

8,"Probably should have saved this for my journal entry, but nonetheless I’ll share with yall. I saw a TT that really stuck with my for a while after I watched it. The caption said something along the lines of “the girl who just can’t figure out her hair part” which in my mind has never bothered me when I looked at someone or myself as well. But it left me with a feeling of “great. Something else to be self conscious of.” My mom engrained this in me as well. For example “she does not need to be wearing a shirt like that, she’s too overweight” etc. I’m so sick of reducing people down to their outward appearance, especially other women. Literally as Brittany said, we’re all gonna die. Let’s focus on more important matters. Spending less time online has helped my mental health immensely."

0,"I just want to mention that saying our bodies are magical, because they are ""able to bring life into this world"" is not the best example to use. Many woman cannot give birth or want to, and that does not make their bodies less magical. Our bodies can do and overcome so many other amazing things. But I totally get the sentiment, it just didn't sit right with me to not mention it, in case someone out there got affected by it."

0,"I’ve been losing a lot of weight in the last half year and everyone from my family commented on it EVERY TIME they saw me. They gave me compliments, asked what I had changed in my diet when in reality I had been eating very poorly and very little due to stress, which I couldn’t tell them because that’d be too honest. They kept on commenting and complimenting (even though I told them to stop) until I found myself on my scale twice a day (something I’ve never done before) and crying if I had gained a kilogram. Then suddenly, when I celebrated myself for being back on the exact weight I was when I was 17 (5 years ago?!?!?!) the compliments stopped and they told me to stop losing weight. I had developed such a severe case of body dismorphia and it put me in that much distress that I have to rely on my partner to tell me that I don’t look sick. I fucking hate this world but deal with the immense amount of guilt when I actually eat a full healthy meal or feel hungry at all."

1,BRITTANY MADAM BROSKI. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. READ FEARING THE BLACK BODY. It is about the racist/colonial origins of fatphobia and it looks at it through an art history lens too. THEN READ HEALTH AT EVERY SIZE ! !

0,"I pick at my lips until they bleed and it hurts so bad but I can’t stop. Been doing it for years. Made heaps of progress with my anxiety and I still can’t stop. So fucking annoying. Thanks for being vulnerable and sharing that you do, too. It helps. Means a lot. <3"
0,I'm proud to say that I have deleted most of my social media and haven't gone back for nearly a month now!! I still have progress to make (my youtube time is atrocious lmao) but yippeee
0,"to add to the ad thing, i have a free ad blocker and it is life changing to me, genuinely. its AMAZING. and also, i think the biggest and best realization i have ever made was that my insecurities dont concern other people because no one really pays that much attention to other people, they are too wound up in their own insecurities (anyone who makes fun of you for how you look or dress is just insecure and trying to cope with then fact that they could never be as cool and beautiful as you are, i have had multiple examples of this throughout my life) . for example, my friend, she always comments on how big her nose is an how insecure she is about it but when i first met her i never even thought that she had a big nose. i genuinely thought it MADE her face, i never even BEGAN to think ""oh her nose is so big"" no i just genuinely thought its what made her beautiful and ive always thought she was so gorgeous and had such a beautiful face. moral of the story, if someone really loves you, they will not judge you for your BODY. and anyone who does, holds no value to you, and you should never care about what people who do not affect your life say/ think about you because THEY DONT MATTER TO YOU and they are probably just as insecure as you are"

In your last video you mentioned how India is made up of lots of cultures & languages but I wasn’t expecting a Punjabi shout out so thank you. It’s strange how many people still don’t know who we are, but it’s heartwarming to be acknowledged in a space that isn’t made just for the Punjabi audience."
0,"In case anyone needed to read what Brittany said: 

Nothing you see online is real. 
Nothing you see online should make you alter the course of your life in a negative way. 
Nothing you see online should influence you to a degree that is financially concerning. 
Nothing you see online should alter your self worth. 
Nothing you see online should ever stick with you in a way that would cause you to doubt who and what you are. 
NOTHING YOU SEE ONLINE IS REAL!

0,"Honestly, I needed this episode now more than ever!!"
0,"i’ve been absolutely losing my mind over the amount of ads everywhere lately, especially here on youtube. I’m old enough to remember the genesis of youtube before there were ads. before it was even an app. I remember the first time I saw an ad on youtube, and being pissed that I had to watch one singular advertisement before I could watch my music videos and jenna marbles. now it takes like 10 minutes to get through a 4 minute video because not only are there more ads to sit through, but they’re unskippable!! I absolutely lost it and gave in, purchasing youtube premium. I’m annoyed I felt the need to get it but this shit drives me absolutely bonkers.
i’m glad i’m not alone in this!"

So if y’all ever feel weak or weird any your body, at the end of the day, you breathe and live and (hopefully most) can walk about this world."

Just watching a simple YouTube video I have multiple ads that I can’t skip or just having ads constantly. It feels like I’m just watching ads at this point and none of the video. Now I stop watching YouTube as much because of it. Same with other platforms. The more the ads, the less I use it."
0,i was so scared you wouldn't recreate it
0,"22:45 dude i genuinely have been getting so frustrated lately because im becoming so aware that everything is just an ad. especially with tiktok shop being a thing now, everyyy single fucking tiktok is an ad and has a product attached and i cant look up a product without seeing so many posts of people saying to buy it on tiktok shop. i also love pinterest but i hate going on it on my phone because of all of the ads, i just use it on my laptop because i have an ad blocker (same thing with youtube because youtube ads actually drive me insane). everything is an ad and nothing is real and sometimes i just want to throw away my phone and stop consuming so much information every second of every day."

1,"It pisses me off when people like Brittany, who have a platform where she has the ear of millions of people across the country and elsewhere, use the excuse of ""just being one person"" to not be proactive in actually trying to create change. You aren't the average American Brittany. You are not just one person who is helpless in it all, you tell yourself that so that you don't actually have to do anything. When you say that, it makes everything else that you say about wanting change seem performative. You have the ability to speak to your audience about what is happening, to educate a mass group of people and at least attempt to organize and resist collectively in some way. You are just too lazy to put thought and action into guiding the millions of people watching you in that way. You say that if you have a platform, it is your duty to use it when injustice is rampant and here you are acting like you're helpless and small when you're not. Do something. As an influencer, you have a hell of a lot more power and sway than you let on."
0,Buccees!!
0,Brittany I hope you understand how important your words are. How deeply they resonate with your viewers. Thank you for speaking so fearlessly about incredibly important issues. I was particularly moved by the hope of yours of exiting this “bubble” of consumerism we live in.

2,"For everyone that doesn't want to see ads on Pinterest, or YT, or anywhere: GET UBLOCK ORIGIN AS AN EXTENSION ON YOUR BROWSER. Get off your phone, start using a pc/laptop. I have not seen an ad in years because I don't use social media on my phone, only on my pc when I feel like it, so I never get ads. Pinterest is especially bad with ads now and is the whole reason why I started using ad blockers. 
There are some ways you might be able to get around ads on mobile (like using a browser with a built-in ad blocker to access any social media sites instead of the app), but its much easier to just ditch mobile as a platform for media consumption and use the desktop versions."

(I'm sorry about my grammar it's not my strongest field) Brittany I'm turning 18 in September and I deleted TikTok a long time ago and only allow myself to get on Instagram every now and then but I stopped doomscrolling. One thing that has been bothering me is how much social media impacted me on what my decisions were in Highschool and my last years of my youth. I developed bulimia and spent a lot of my time and money on sh*t that didn't matter to me in a few months. I still have that issues with fomo and wanting to feel good about myself. This episode reminded me about how easy it is to fall for  propaganda  and how much I don't need things. I'm thankful for my body and health and I think this is what I needed to hear today."

0,"I hope someone will riff off this but the ""nothing online is real"" is something I've been going at for a while. One of many reasons I deleted my socials. This podcast is one of the only things I return to habitually in terms of media. It's so crazy, because you witness things online and they are seemingly real events that happen which then inform us and out beliefs. But they are not real experiences we have had. Were were not in the room where it happened, with those people or at that time. And we're shaping our identity and world-experience off of ""non-experiences"". Our lives are becoming more and more vapid and meaningless with the cancerous consumption of media, ANY media in my opinion. Because we are essentially scammed into thinking these things are real. Did they happen to someone else? perhaps. Are they important to know? possibly a small fraction of the information. Does it bring us joy? Yes, or at least the illlusion of it. Were we there when it happened? Absolutely not. It's really interesting as I follow people who are growing their ""offline presence"" which is essentially just, presence in real life. And at the end of the day, out real human and personal experiences are what we remmeber and take with us. Not anything we see on socials or the internet."

At my healthiest I'm an XL, and currently I'm about a 2X (note that XL XXL =/= 1X 2X). i feel SO MUCH BETTER in my clothes when I'm in a plus size, its unreal. they clothes are actually made for me, rather than an XS sized up. there's room for boobs, the fabric is nicer, THERE ARE BUTTONS BETWEEN THE BUTTONS TO PREVENT GAPS!!! Do I feel worse physically when I'm heavier? Absolutely. But I still feel THOUSANDS TIMES BETTER in that plus sized item. Sometimes its not the size of your body that matters, its the industry. If you feel like shit in your size L clothes its not because you're overweight, its because the clothes were not made for you."
0,watching this as the sun sets on my 20th birthday - the body image section is a conversation ive had with myself for far too much of my life as a girl. thank you for being so passionate and so open about your thoughts and feelings. its such an important thing to keep mindful of and remember that your image is only one part of you. i hope that in my 20s i can be kinder to myself than i have been about it. much love

0,"Can I say her rant about how beautiful women are and how we're closest thing to magic in this world as the ones with the ability to create life meant so much after giving birth 2 weeks ago and looking at my changed body with unhappiness, but this body made my baby girl, how could it be anything but magical? 😭"

1,"I deleted all my social media around 2020 because it was all becoming just too much. I’m on Pinterest and YouTube now and those are the only social media platforms I use and get little updates on. I’ll download tiktok whenever someone sends me a video just so I can watch it but then delete or if I wanna see a post someone sent me on Instagram I might just go on the website online but hop right back off. Social media genuinely gives me anxiety like having to keep up with people’s posts and like this and that and I tried it again in highschool but ended up just deleting it again cause I was like, “friends just aren’t worth this anxiety, this bs.” I thought I had to be relevant on the apps to keep friends but they were still cool actually which kind of surprised me. It just so happened to be the type of people they were. They didn’t really care if I had it or not. Deleting those apps I literally felt a weight lifted off of my shoulders like the next day (I didn’t tell any of my friends I was deleting it by the way cause they were kind of getting on my nerves at the time) it was so quiet. I remember it being so quiet like I had finally found peace of mind. I’ve been free of the TikTok shackles for like five years now and i love not being hip to stuff just so people can get mad at me and then explain it. I still am subject to good Pinterest scroll but am trying not to do it so often. 10/10 highly recommend ❤"

As a larger teen - 250 and around 5’10” - being around a lot of people the weigh less than 150 and are 5’5” and below I get a lot of anxiety about my appearance, but hearing BB discuss the MIRACLE that is the human body, especially the FEMALE body, has helped me sooooooo much."

0,THANK YOU BRITT FOR THIS..FUCKING THANK YOU..I am so sick of women being forced to adhere to beauty standards that the celebs themselves aren't even following fully! BECAUSE IT'S NOT REAL THEY JUST CHASINGGG ..and then toxin men shame you for not looking like it....and the celebs that support this shit is heart breaking..like syndey sweeney I just saw her american eagle ad...THE COMMENTS FILLED WITH SIMPS AND TOXIN MEN...I AM SO TIRED OF THE WORLD CATERING TO THESE MEN ...THE JEANS ARE FOR WOMEN NOT MEN STOP ADVERTISING TO THRISTY MEN..i don't wanna see someone sexualized selling me JEANS...I WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE JEANSSS
0,I am trying every day to get toxic masculine ideas out my brain..I despise how they're allowed to rule society and if we speak up against we are labeled ugly or wrong..i am so tired of being a woman in this world
1,"Thank you so so so so much for addressing this. I don't even know what the hell a labubu is and I'm honestly proud of that haha. Social media is a mind trap, and people are SO unbelievably wrapped up in it tat their entire being and way of thinking and living is absorbed by it. I am only 22 and I had experienced my mind DECAYING before I started cutting myself off. 

We're forgetting what it really is to live. It's seriously horrifying."
0,"I love that Brittany is slowly becoming more and more radical. A few episodes from now, she might be full leftist at this rate 😂"
14,"not to sound extremely parasocial or cliché, but i truly believe what i'm about to say. discovering brittany was genuinely a breath of fresh air. sure, there are other creators i tune into, but no one gives me the same comfort as her. these podcast episodes feel like reading the create mode instagram story of a random person you don't know and don't remember following, but they're cool and have great takes so you click on their story as fast as you can every time it comes up. it feels real like nothing and no one else on the internet these days."

1,"I am a labubu lover. BUT it doesn't affect me negatively in any way. Financial, time spent on phone, ect but I'm also not the typical audience for the type to fall into these trends. I only own a couple and because I think they're cute, they were cheaper at the time and easy to get, and it's barely a faction of the specially reserved ""me"" money. I do not agree with any of the crazy labubu stuff going on because really it is just a keychain. They lost me when they got to be over $27 for the expensive special keychains. You absolutely need to have a sense of you but it's also ok to like something and have a few IF you have means of doing so and it again doesn't impact you negatively"

0,So gorgeous today have to save it for when I can watch not just listen
0,"54:17 okay brittany can i be so serious rn, i've been to florida universal studios twice and it was so much fun both times, BUT I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH THEM. i was in middle school one of the times i went, and we were in the harry potter area in hogsmeade, and like right across from where the main harry potter ride is is another ride called ""flight of the hippogriff""...i got on there and you know they're supposed to check everyone's stuff is like on right, BUT MINE WAS NOT CLICKED IN ALL THE WAY. the thing that goes over your arms and chest was not clicked in all the way because they didn't check mine properly, so basically the seatbelt part was my last bastion of hope, so i was just closing my eyes and clinging on for dear life until the ride was over, and it was actually really scary. in retrospect, i definitely should have said something at least afterwards but i was about like 12 and i didn't know what to even do in that situation lol. but i still think about it sometimes, because when the ride started going i could FEEL that the restraints were too loose...and idk how high up in the air we were, but it was for sure high enough to where if i had undone the seatbelt or fallen out at all somehow, i'm pretty sure i would not have survived. strangely enough though, i wouldn't consider the experience traumatizing because i guess my middle schooler brain was just built different; i barely processed what had happened at all, i just shrugged it off. now i still go to six flags every winter with my stepdad and stepsiblings so it's whatever i guess? 🤷i wonder if i could have gotten any money out of it, though.."

0,"I’ve just considered myself old now because I do not look on social media anymore. Everything is an ad, I go for a quick escape and get frustrated. Why are they trying to sped up the process of mental illness for young people?? It’s a quicker turnover rate for people to fall back into depression now more than ever and the need for shopping therapy is growing rapidly. I wonder why."

1,WARNING its dangerous to listen to Brittany broskie in a HOSPITAL cafeteria!!! you'll try to laugh silently but you will actually end up gasping for air and having an asthma attack. but i will say a freakin HOSPITAL is the best place to hyperventilate in a corner alone but make sure to hide your journal because the freaky nurses might read it. okay love you.

I didn't realize how addicted to it I was and how horrible it made me feel comparing myself to everyone's ""get ready with me's"" etc and all these expensive lifestyles/things I didn't have, it was bad. And at some point a few months ago I decided to delete my instagram too, and holy crap my mental health has SIGNIFICANTLY improved. We all need a break."

0,"Brittany the skin picking you're talking about is called dermatillomania. I have it too. Been struggling with it for years. I have acne so I pick at my pimples as I see them as imperfections that I have to get rid of. But any little bump my brain will deem as needing to get rid of. Can't tell you how many times I've looked in the mirror and cried about the way I look, and what I do to my skin. It's gotten better than it was a few years ago, but it still prevails. You talking about it makes me feel less alone. I always thought you had perfect skin. Little did I know you're in the same boat as me. We're in this together 🫂"

3,"17:20 lesbian here—this is REAL. it means so much to me that you added that, because on top of deconstructing my internalized homophobia, at least I can say, the search for male validation is still on the forefront of how we as women subconsciously judge ourselves"
0,"The balance of profound commentary on society and utter silliness is why I listen every week. As a very hormonal and self critical pregnant 1st time mama to be, I really appreciated what you said Mother Broski. So grateful for you every week ❤️"

0,I also have anxiety-induced dermotillomania (I can't spell oops) and it sucks so bad
0,"18:03 “why does this feel so foreign?” Because our culture is intensely capitalist, and being happy, secure, and whole is considered wrong. To be happy is sneered at, derided and hated. If you appear visibly happy, comfortable with yourself, it will irritate everyone else who is on the misery train. 
We need to re-evaluate our culture cus it’s a misery machine to extract maximum productivity and purchases to fill the holes made by the culture."

2,"Brittnay, I really need to hear your rant because it's how I feel too, and it is so anxiety-inducing to think that this is really what life has come to: being sold...  It feels good to hear you discuss your anger in this context as well. It makes me feel less alone and crazy as many people don't speak the quiet out loud. I say all the time that I wish I could just have one landline in my room that I can decide whether I want to actively pick it up or not. Your podcast is the one thing on gods internet (hahaha) that truly feels like it's not rotting my brain out of my skull. Thank You Brittnay!"

I just had to share during the labubu discussion sorry if my time stamp is random lol"

0,Brittany i mean this with my whole heart you remind me of my favorite English teacher in high school (I’m the same age as you lmao) you have such an old wise soul and the way you speak is so clear and passionate :)
0,I think it’s kinda rude to say bc labubu’s are a Hong Kong toy from a big brand called pop mart that’s been around for a decade. This ain’t new. If you’re mad ppl are spending their money where they want you are a hateful person. Britney I love you but that’s offensive. Some adults like to fulfill something’s they didn’t get as a child. Called inner child healing.
0,"I've carried two babies to term.

 Lost my third during pregnancy.

 One emergency c section, one vbac birth.

 I breastfed for a total of five years. Spent a total of 80 hours of my life in labor. After my second baby
 my man wasn't attracted to me anymore and wanted one of my skinny friends instead, I starved myself, while breastfeeding, so extremely that I lost 40 pounds in 4 months. Most of my hair fell out and my teeth were loose in my mouth. I was having fainting spells. I got help and got better. Now I am single and my youngest son is 5. I eat every day, and every day I wish I could skip it. 

Every day the disorder tries to pull me apart, and I pretend that I am a young girl, that I am parenting myself, because I would never treat a child the way I treat myself. I was literally body checking in the mirror when Britney told me to sit ""crisscross applesauce"" and when she went in I started hyperventilating. It felt like a punch in the face. 

I'm grateful I listened to this today, because I am SO ashamed of my mama belly and boobs. I need these reminders everyday."

I’m so sick of people saying you should stop or it’s going to leave scars or it’s gross. I don’t care. I don’t think it’s ugly. I actually don’t care what you think.

0,"37:30 ""if no one ever heard from me again the world would not change"" miss broski that is so false. it would have a profound impact on so many because of not what you bring to the internet but the world generally. I know that this mindset of 'one person can't do anything' is about how miniscule the actions of one person are in comparison with the rich and powerful but I feel like it inadvertently gets it into people's heads that by being an average citizen they are inherently powerless. And who does that mindset benefit?"

I truly needed to hear that this cannot be fixed or cared for by one person. This guilt and fear I feel all the time is not something I can explain but THIS episode explained it. I’m not alone.

0,"I’ve struggled with really bad skin picking since I was in middle school (just graduated high school this year). Its one of the hardest things to overcome. Its a version of self harm unfortunately. When our minds are so overwhelmed, we turn to pain or exposure thats so much worse than whats running in our minds, to distract us. But the point that Brittany makes of almost this repeating cycle of having such bad anxiety from constant expectations and extreme exposure of the internet, then we get insecure of the scars we create from our anxiety because the internet is telling us this and that about how we should look! Its a constant cycle that more and more women are experiencing. Its exhausting."

Like they are all throughout our culture, our society, our values. Like not being online hasn't spared me many of these issues because you just learn and see them elsewhere is the reality. I don't know what the best change would be to fix this, but only with change will the issue actually be resolved."

162,"My parasocial auntie Brittany, as a 16 year old girl in a small town going through the TRENCHES of high school, your podcast makes me feel hopeful. I have quite a small class and we’re all girls, there’s this weird unspoken competition between everyone of who gets the best grades and who does the best work in math. I’m horrible at math, but I was top of the class in English. Knowing you also struggled with math makes me feel better, because you are one of the smartest people I know of. You are so incredibly quick witted and funny and clever, and you’re so thoughtful and sometimes you say things that just make me pause and think for a moment. I don’t want you to feel any kind of pressure that you’re some kind of role model(let’s be fr now) but I do think you are incredibly wise and your podcasts cure my attention span. Hearing everything you have to say about self image genuinely makes me see myself in a better light. Now I hope you don’t take it as an offence that a high school student feels understood by what you say."

0,"listening to her talk about our bodies while 7 months postpartum is crazy, needed it."
0,"The general term for picking at your skin, etc. is body-focused repetitive behaviour (BFRB). You can engage in a BFRB without it rising to the level of a full-on disorder, but if it's really serious, then it may be a disorder like OCD or dermatillomania (if it's skin) or trichotillomania (if it's hair).

A lot of behaviours (both BFRBs and otherwise) exist on a spectrum and don't automatically indicate a disorder, similar to how fear and stress are universal human emotions and don't automatically indicate an anxiety disorder. The diagnostic criteria usually include (among other things) how much the behaviour is harming you and how problematic it is in your life.

But behaviours that don't qualify, clinically, as a disorder can still cause problems for you even if they aren't as severe as fully disordered behaviours (e.g., biting your nails might not be a disorder but you still might want to stop), so, either way, it is legitimate to seek out help with BFRBs."
0,"broski, you look absolutely ravishing when you disneybound as marie antoinette"

0,"I completely agree with the bubble thing. Yesterday my very best friend was in the ER and didn't want me to go through the ""hassle"" of visiting her. BITCH!! I would peel off my toenails for you! HASSLE?? And of course I went and brought food but it got me thinking about that stupid ""I don't owe anyone anything"" bullshit. For me, if it's my friend, driving someone to the airport or visiting someone in the hospital or helping someone move isn't really a hassle for me in my able body. I don't feel like I am doing anything crazy out of the ordinary or like I need to be paid back. That's insane to me. These are the kinds of things I WANT to do because you're my friend, it's no skin off mine to lend a hand. And I can't imagine how shitty a person I'd have to be if I was perfectly physically able to do those sorts of things and just didn't want to because I felt my time was ""too important"" or whatever. And it's not like I'm rich, yes the gas money will be gone but if I ever need anything I hope I have a community around me. And you don't just get a community innately, that's not something everyone deserves, you have to earn it. LEND A HAND! And during a loneliness epidemic? Shit"
0,"Heyy Brittany, love you so much <333 your speech about womens bodies and internet influence really helped me feel better in my skin. And I wanted to share that my friend also has that ""habit"" of REALLY picking at their skin and she was told by a doctor that it comes from ocd and its obsessions and is related to anxiety and is sort of a way to relieve stress. Hopefully it gives you some insight if you see this, but anyway I cherish and bow down to you, my supreme leader, may though be well"

I always felt so envious of other girls skin and how clear it is. and hearing that others struggle with the same thing shows me that we as a society really pick and dissect every little thing about our appearances to the point where we cause the opposite of what we want. It means a lot to me that Brittney was comfortable enough to share her experience."

I had to take the lights out of the bathroom and  not look in mirrors for about 2 years. Now, I'm doing a lot better but will occasionally pick and prod.

1,"**DERMATILLOMANIA COMMENT**

We pick at our skin like animals in captivity. Same reason people smoke, drink, any vices. It’s more akin to a self harm issue than anything. My triggers were doing my makeup, using a magnifying mirror, looking in the mirror as soon as I woke up, car mirrors, having an oily face, etc. identify triggers, intercept the thought, acknowledge the urge, and move past it. 

Slugging my skin helped me stop picking, because the extreme slip left no ability to really push and pick, and it’s a tactile reminder of ‘oh slimy don’t pick’. I used original aquaphor on my face and chest. I washed the area and applied aquaphor every morning, and you can wash and reapply at night if you want. The aquaphor can help heal open wounds, so it’s a good method to try if you’re in an active dermatillomania episode. Pimple patches can achieve the same effect, but it’s just harder to cover a large area. Garlic oil capsules can reduce cystic acne, menstrual acne, and body acne. Less acne can offer less opportunities to pick. An exfoliating lotion will help prevent ingrown hairs. Eucerin Intensive Repair Body Lotion For Extremely Dry Skin has chemical exfoliants, several moisturizers, and a thick sealant factor. It will help new hairs come through the skin, prevent pore clogging, and support a healthy skin barrier. It’s also unscented and gives a beautiful glow to the skin. That’s everything I remember off the top of my head, if y’all have questions we can brainstorm in replies ❤"

0,"Supreme leader, have you watched the black mirror episode called ""common people""? It hits head on the nail when it comes to subscriptions and the premium levels, and yes it is an exaggeration of what is going on currently but it really hit home with me when it comes to paying those premium prices, just because I can. Because if we the people keep paying more and more to keep the ads away, those companies will just keep adding new levels."

0,"babe. you are rich beyond measure. whilst you sit in your home studio in your LA mansion with about 8 funko pops on your desk, (all of which will also end up in landfill) i really dont think a few labubus are ending the world. let people have fun. the worlds a fucking dark place for everyone, even moreso if you have no prospects or financial abundance (unlike yourself). for many its SIMPLY a small piece of joy in a bleak existence. yes, i get joy from my beautiful cat, and loved ones, but the lil freaks also bring me pleasure. so kindly, frick off with trying to be the arbiter of who's allowed to enjoy what."

It’s more street racing than race track, but if you want to see badass female drivers (and some male drivers) I highly recommend!

0,"If you change your perspective,  a lot of these ""pressures"" wont really affect you. Razors, wax, surgeries, makeup, anything targeted towards ""altering"" your appearance IS AN OPTION. Nobody has ever said that people HAVE to do these things. Thats your own sheep brain problem. Ppl see one person they like do something and bc they have no mind of their own, they copy it by any means necessary.  All of these things are OPTIONS. NOT requirements. Everyone is so afraid of thinking for themselves theyre blaming society for becoming something they didnt want to be 😂 life is a little lonely sometimes, being a true individual, but its so much better than being constantly overwhelmed with all this bullshit that doesnt matter. To each their own iguess."

0,17:56 real
5,"I'm a 25 year old woman who stopped shaving my legs and underarms. Small thing, but very fun and freeing. I feel more like my own person. Shaving our legs is, if we're honest, nothing but a regular exercise to practice and show submission to societal expectation. At 16:10 you ask what a perfect body is. A false ideal sold to us. Men aren't actually that picky, but they do enjoy a woman whose confidence is contingent upon their approval. From romance stories of princesses meeting their princes when we're children to representation in media of a certain image of what girls and women should be, women are conditioned from the start to submit to appealing to the male gaze and structuring our lives around adhering to pleasing it so as to avoid being looked over (because we're taught romance could be the peak of our lives, which contributes to women's overall dependency and desperation for male approval and validation.) and/or disadvantaged within a patriarchal society. We lose hours of life shaving, doing makeup and our hair daily, thinking of how to look more ""feminine"". No body hair, like children. Manipulated like fools into buying it being cleaner as though we can't scrub and as though male's hair is somehow clean though ours wouldn't be. It's one contributing practice that conditions us into accepting and not questioning nonsensical things for the sake of just being a 'good woman' (manipulatable pushover who cares more about pleasing others and being accepted rather than thinking for themselves and realizing that things can be different. Decenter males.)"

2,"As someone who has always stayed away from social media for the most part (I love YT, Tumblr, and Pinterest), I don't know that it is the consumption of the material that is the problem. I think it is the consumption of all of this material in isolation that is the problem. I am curious what would happen if, after we consumed, we forced ourselves to discuss what we watched with others we trusted and/or we forced ourselves to create something/act in some way inspired by what we saw. It does not have to be perfect, I think it just has to be earnest and being earnest is a lost art. Instead we just consume so much of this (which can be good!), but our brains are not made to process all of this ourselves."

And it’s not just online. We see it in our politics, in real life, in places it should NOT be. Not to say that politics themselves aren’t inherently extreme, I just feel like we have normalized it.

14,"What I think the aversion to benson Boone is that the night he received the most hate was in fact the Grammys. The guy was sandwhiched between two of the biggest acts of the night (Chappell Roan and DOECHII) and performed alongside a piano and his band. The climax of his act were in fact the backflips. I understand everyones reaction because it is jarring to see multiple artist come out and deliver high quality Super Bowl 
Level performances and then it’s just a guy in a bodysuit doing flips over a piano. And it’s not like it doesn’t work we’ve seen artist do that before and it works. Elton John, Freddy Mercury, Bruno Mars just guys with pianos (although Bruno Mars has done so much more since then). I think people are starting to catch up with the difference of effort in the music industry when it comes to men and women. We’ve seen this multiple times where men will just plop themselves on a stage and sing and women will do 3 act musicals with intermission (joke) and men will be credited for just sitting there and being hot. Women have had to do so much more to get noticed and I think people are arriving at the conclusion that maybe women should be rewarded more for their efforts. Not to say he’s a bad performer because his voice is good and the backflips are a good gag but I think that if it were 2014 people would be more on board with the idea of a so called Benson Boone."

0,"To anyone struggling with severe anxiety, please… please stop smoking/ingesting marijuana. In most cases, anxiety is exacerbated when you’re regularly using weed. It might feel like it’s helping in the moment, but it’s really not. It’s a procrastination tool. It can put the worries aside or muffle them, but it doesn’t solve them and your body holds onto those feelings. 

Let yourself feel anxiety and then ground yourself in reality."
0,"I think that are best solution to overcome the truly absurd levels of marketing and advertising in our daily lives is to revive physical media once again. Read books, buy CDs or vinyl & although it may limit our usual access to a million options it will help us all to reestablish a feeling of genuine enjoyment. Not only that but it would also afford us the opprotunities to enjoy 3rd party spaces again. A local bookstore, library, coffee shop, record store, etc. We need human connection and genuine connection is found through daily interaction big and small."

The idea is to choose the option of diplomacy as much as you can, instead of jumping into war for the sake of foreign exploitation and national unity.

I went from spending 16 hours a day (mind you, WITH a full time job and school) on my phone, with insta and TikTok being at the top, to now spending 4 hours a day on my phone with things like YouTube, audible, etc being my top contenders.

It’s disgusting how easily it is for capitalism to steal your money, time, and now attention. It’s nothing but depression, really. The knowledge of how we don’t actually own ourselves or our lives, corporations do. I’m still looking for ways to reclaim my time and energy, but the screen time thing was a great start."

0,About the advertising crashout. You should listen to Feed by M.T Anderson. It's a book but listening to the audio versuon does it justice so much better on getting the point across. It's set in a futuristic world and ads bombard the individuals and their lives. It's a crazy listen and it made me realize when the characters would have an ad happen in their head I wasn't fazed because I'm so used to hearing ads when listening to podcasts and stuff. It was a big eye opener. Def a crashout listen though sooo....

0,"one of the best things i ever did for myself was get off all social media except youtube and tumblr. now, tumblr is not NOT perfect BUT, in comparison to instagram and tik tok it’s like a paradise. the ads are absolutly so stupid that you never even pay them any attention. and it’s so curated to your exact interests: for me, bugs, i’ve just got this wonderful little community of bug pictures and art and that’s all i consume. there’s basically no reels which is amazing, there is so so so much LONG text posts so yay attention span and reading. and like, no one posts themselves (unless it’s a nsfw account and it’s usually a bunch of gorgeous fat ladies so win win) so if you’ve got issues with your body like me you just completely stop thinking about it because no one gives a fuck. anyways, internet is a plague and like yeah what she said about how if somone truly cares about you they won’t care how you look it’s SO IMPORTANT. if someone really cares how big your belly is they are not the kind of person that you can rely on as a life partner or just a friend. when you love someone as a person, that person - whatever package they come in, is special and treasured to you! 
+ if you’re having trouble with internet spaces but still need your social media fix i strongly recommend switching to tumblr, it’s not at all dead like people think it is and almost all of the people are so nice if you stay out of political spaces. for all my bug people, tumblr is the absolute dream there are so many critter loving people on there. crabs, slugs, spiders, stingrays, sharks, opossums - they’re all there!"

1,"Having Dermatillomania is no fucking joke. It can also be hereditary too. My grandma on my mother’s side had it and I’ve always struggled with it since I was a LITTLE GIRL. I’m now in my 20s and it has gotten so debilitating at times. I have the problem with my fingers and when I have bad flare ups I get so self conscious about my hands - I feel like they’re ugly and because of that, I pick at them. I have red scars that span all the way across my thumbs from the tissue I’ve picked for decades. And the cycle continues. Over the years I’ve tried so many remedies… using special nail polish, using a habit-breaking app. Nothing worked. The longest streak I had was around 200 days and then I had a bad rebound. All of it stems from my childhood trauma, as a way that I cope with anxiety and my self worth. I’m in remission right now only because I’ve been getting acrylic nails for the last few months and they’ve been helping me a lot. All I wanna say is that I see you Brittney, and you’re not alone. 🩷"

0,3min ago? Okay hello good morning yall ❤
0,watching this 3 min after it was posted GOOOD MORNINGGGGG BROSKI NATION
0,"I am only about 17 minutes into the broadcast and this is so cheesy and cringe, but I am so moved (genuinely) that I feel compelled to share. I am a little older than you (born in 91) and probably like you - I have never known adult life without a smart phone. I have never known adulthood without social media. I was on MySpace before high school, then Facebook, IG, TikTok, etc to follow. I am a mother and have thought often about how my childhood was so different that my kids - they get on tablets at school, grow up in a world where every adult is staring at their phone constantly, (as a generation) their earliest childhood experiences broadcast to their parents friends and acquantainces…and I didn’t experience that. I have mourned for them because of these things. 

It struck me that there is a version of adulthood and womanhood that I never got to experience - the version without smart phones and social media. I kind of felt like something had been robbed from me. I made the decision to take an entire year off from social media! No FB, IG, or TikTok from my 33rd birthday to my 34th. I only lasted around a month. And then I “needed” to post something or check something and I was right back down the rabbit hole. I set screen time limits on my phone, they did nothing. I would last a couple days. Then I’d get on something else like Substack and spend forever on a screen there. I would be watching a dumb Instagram reel thinking “I don’t want to be doing this right now” and still be unable to pull myself away and just swipe right on to the next. Your episode “Love Island & Michelangelo” had inspired me so much to get back into the hobbies I loved as a girl. I want to be able to focus my time and attention and effort and energy on those things and my family and my work and be completely removed from the BS of the internet. But I get so nostalgic for it. I long for the comfort of a familiar Instagram account/content creator. I read Fahrenheit 451 a few weeks ago - I am Mildred with her ear thimbles. I’ve made these creators and accounts like my Family in the parlor. How often have I needed myself to be pumped clean of the absolute sludge and slop I have stuffed myself with from social media? Then how many times have I gone right back to it? I guess all this is to say you aren’t alone - the 24k labubu Dubai chocolate Benson Boone crumbl cookie of it all. I appreciate your voice. I cannot imagine the added layer of a smartphone and the internet being your livelihood and stream of income - and a way to share your art with the world! Those are the pieces of the internet I am so thankful for. I can decry social media in one breath and in the next be so thankful to has exposed me to some ideas and people and art I would have missed otherwise. It is so complicated. Anyway…I ordered one of those bloom cards and it’s been really useful. I’m literally taking it to my bank today to put inside my safe deposit box so I can’t just tap it willy nilly. Also why is it so freaking embarrassing to admit I have a phone addiction when literally everyone else I know does too? (Deep exhale of smoke from the worlds longest drag on a cigarette that hasn’t been ashed) anyway proud to be a member of broski nation, keep up the good work!!"

The Caraval series by Stephanie Garber is good too. Or her other series ‘Once upon a broken heart’, all of these don’t have spice tho, they are young adult."
1,I’m really disappointed that you call yourself an ally to the trans community but still speak so highly of Harry Potter and attend Harry Potter events like at Universal. You should really look at what J.K. Rowling has done to the community.

0,Intro did not disappoint
0,"If you’re a sucker for hot dudes with swords, parallel universes, and a little “whoops I fell into another realm and now I’m betrothed to a warlord” moment, then the Fantasyland Series by Kristen Ashley will eat you alive. In the best way. Every book gives you a different modern woman who accidentally (or magically, or fatefully, who knows?) ends up in a completely different world. There’s magic, dragons, royal courts, wild customs, and these scorching hot men who do not know how to chill. And the SPICE??? Girl. It’s giving slow burn into “omg my Kindle’s on fire.” The worldbuilding is rich, the stakes are high, the hair is braided, and the sexual tension could crack stone. The audiobooks have multiple narrators. It's pure art. You’re welcome. 💅✨"

176,"Hi Brittany,
You probably won’t see this, but I had to say thank you. A year ago, I felt completely lost. After high school, I went straight into work and quickly realized how much I missed learning. I didn’t think I was smart enough for college, and I had no idea what I wanted to do.

Then I found your videos. Watching you, so confident, funny, and intelligent, helped me stop overthinking and believe in myself again. You lit that spark in me to go after higher education. I took a chance, applied to a few schools, and got accepted.

Now I’m studying for my bachelor’s in Forensic Science and feel unstoppable. Thank you for being such an incredible inspiration. You truly changed my life."

0,"I didn't want to leave goodreads either but then I found out that you can move your lists to fable really easily, it basically does it for you.

Only complaint is that I sometimes can't find a book that I'm reading but it's only been books that are in Finnish so it's probably because of that"

Like 10 pages out of 500 are sex and it’s porn? It’s just more propaganda to degrade something women enjoy as being trashy and non intellectual.

0,"As a fellow romantasy enjoyer and who also has the same gripes as you when it comes to female male characters (and male ones too) I'd like to recommend you Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson.

I know it's not romantasy but!! I think you'll enjoy it, at least character-wise. It's fantasy , and looot of depth and details but easy to read either way? 

I'm reading the second book of the series , Words of Radiance  (because only now has it's been translated to my native language)  so I'm still ""green"" in the series but I honestly, it's been very very good
I have friends who have already read all of the available books in english and everyone who has read it has a lot of praise for it so..  I think it's worth a shot"

0,Do yourself a favour and leave goodreads and get StoryGraph!! So much better. The transfer is super easy and I need more people to follow on there 🥺🥺
0,"When Brittany was talking about Shield of Sparrows I fucking melted. I LOVE writing stories like that (Even if they are trash...) It makes me feel so fuzzy and having a tender-hearted MC is everything.
However, for some reason it made me think of the movie Belle // ryuu to sobakasu no hime
The main character is soft spoken, quiet, and kind hearted, she carries so much and unable to do what she loves due to trauma of her mothers death. 
There's a virtual world called ""U"" and it's I guess the best representation would be like VR/VRChat. There you can disguise yourself through the AI Biometric Analysis. 

Okay TL;DR: Girl with trauma and a beautiful voice steps her ass up to try to understand someone that people have been massively hated in the Virtual Space. 

It may not be Brittany's Cup of tea since theres no romance but it will make your heart swell if anyone wants to watch it and hasn't seen it. Again I don't know why I thought of that movie when she explained Shield of Sparrows"

OUABH is a sequelish series to Caraval (my fave series ever) and imo people should read it to have more context on actions characters make in OUABH, but it’s not required and I’m not sure if Caraval is totally your speed. Check it out!"

0,"As someone who has had their gallbladder out, supplementing fiber with every meal has been integral to having solid bowel movements again. Without your gallbladder, bile is continuously leaking into your gut and is no longer reabsorbed into the biliary system. Allowing the bile to travel beyond its intended destination is irritating to the intestines and causes bile acid diarrhea. Taking a fiber supplement, specifically one containing soluble fiber, binds these bile acids and doesn't allow them to irritate the lower GI tract. Obviously, as yours is a special case, consult your doctor, but I felt the need to tell you this in case it helps even a little. Plus, we could all use a little more fiber. :)"

They, however, started to flower like a pepper, not like a marigold. As I checked them, I saw one had grown peppers and decided to pick one. I smelled said pepper, and it smelled sweet; however, I had my suspicions. I took the smallest bite and started yelling outside, ""Oh my god!"". My mouth was burning like never before. I bolted inside my house. I drank all the almond milk I had and even started drinking regular milk (lactose intolerant). They are either ghost peppers or Carolina reapers. I love insanely spicy food, but that was something else. Now I sit watching this video contemplating and acting like that never happened. I enjoy reading romance novels that have a lot of depth too."

1,31:02 I know you said you are not on Fable or StoryGraph but all those things that were listed wrong with Goodreads are on Fable. StoryGraph I am not sure about. I didn’t enjoy the setup when I downloaded it but with Fable all you have to do is import all of your books from Goodreads and it takes a couple of minutes at max to get everything moved over.
1,"we had a guest (context: I work valet at a hotel) whom we all called babyman after he threw a hissy fit, yelling and screaming at the valet about how it was outrageous he had to ... circle the block twice to get a spot in the loading zone during check in, like that was either unreasonable or the valets fault, and whom threw his suitcase across the entryway in front of like 15 people, towards his traveling companion, who we are pretty sure was his mother"

But I was able to import all my lists from Goodreads over to Fable in a couple minutes. I HIGHLY recommend making the switch cause Fable is an effing beautiful app compared to Goodreads. It creates cute little stats reports on your read genres, and gives you a reader type based on what you've read. It's just a million times better in so many ways. My whole book club made the switch and we haven't looked back. Oki that is all. Byeeeee"

174,"The Arabic perfumeries go crazy. They’re designed to last in extreme heat and sweat, and due to their historical ties to Egypt and the Silk Road, Arabs are basically perfume experts. Arabs also perfected distillation, a process that extracts scent or health properties from materials. 

No weird alcohol smells, no fake ass fruit or floral smells, just actual rich scent. The obvious baby of the Arab TikTok perfumes is Choco Musk, which I have both the perfume and the body oil (different projections and wear times but the same notes overall). I’m a vanilla GIRL and I am extremely picky with smells, and I also don’t want to spend a lot on an everyday perfume. The Al-Rehab brand always pulls through. Anything from gourmand to floral to clean laundry. The oil rollerballs are like 4-10 dollars too, so you can keep extra ones all over.

There’s many expensive or high end Arab perfumes too if you’re in the market, but I don’t have the budget to comment on those yet."

0,"Both StoryGraph and Fable allow you to import your Goodreads data so it’s all there when you start! 

I’m such a fable girlie now, there are so many more features and it’s user friendly, both huge improvements from Goodreads. The feed is awesome, I never miss an update from my friends, and it will analyze your profile with other users to see how your reading habits compare. 

I would recommend importing your Goodreads into both fable and StoryGraph at the same time so you can try both and see which one you like better! #notsponsored"

0,"Hello my dearest supreme leader, 
Long time listener, infrequent commenter here. Just wanted to say thank you for what you do. I own a business and work from home and most of my friends have either moved out of the area or we’ve just grown distant as time has gone on. Since I’m home so much I have trouble making friends, and I’ve been feeling really lonely these past few months. The other day when I found out my husband was cheating on me because i “dont give him enough blowjobs” I really realized what a disservice I have done for myself by not prioritizing female friendships the way I need to. I remembered the other day you talking about the importance of friends, and it immediately gave me the guidance I needed and I knew what to do. I reached out to a few of my girls even though weve been a little more distant that we were, and they helped me so much. And you, Brittany, have helped me so much. You make me feel much less lonely at our hour a week lectures, you make me laugh, and you make me feel seen. You remind me there is always a place in the world for women like us that take up space, and have complex thoughts and feelings. Thank you for being you. 

Your loyal follower, 
Hot Dog Water."

0,"I think we can have a little grace for people losing their minds in the airport. Like, behavior, not excusable, but I think you can still have some empathy for them. No one wakes up and decides that they're going flail around on the ground in front of tsa and the whole public, there's something very clearly wrong that we can't have the full picture of. It might just be the worst day of that person's life, and on top of that they have to go through the fucking stress building to get on a flying metal tube. I once had a public freakout over being denied access to my meds. If someone was recording and posted it online, I'd probably look like an entitled maniac freaking out at someone for no reason"

0,I accidentally sped it up to 1.5 while she was singing soulja boy😂 please try that guys
0,"17:23 I’ll tell yall that Shield of Sparrows was not it for me. I was annoyed the whole time. Why does she ask 10,000 questions to herself but NONE of them to the people with answers? Why is she literally so useless????? And I can’t stand the “oh I’m so frail and stupid and ugly” but every male character thinks she’s a freaking goddess. Also can’t stand that bro was called “The Guardian” for way over half the book. It’s a silly ass title and it just sounded so cheesy. And in a fantasy book pitched as “Cinderella meets the Witcher” I had the highest hopes because my novel is Beauty and the Beast meets the Witcher. So I was like oh my god, this is gonna be an epic tale with scary monsters and a sweeping romance. Girl. It was no where CLOSE. Idk how it has gotten such good reviews because the story writing (plot, character development) is ass. The setting could’ve been cool. I love monsters and a beautifully crafted realm. But the characters just ruined it. The mc was the most irritating woman I’ve read in a long time. BUT LISTEN. If it’s your cup of tea, yall, that’s for you to enjoy. But for me, I couldn’t stand it and DNF’ed halfway through. I gave it the good ol’ college try but I just couldn’t do it anymore. I still wanna attempt to read Silver Elite bc that one came out the same time as Shield of Sparrows and was pitched as Hunger Games for adults but it has the same kind of divided audience. 
I love the book talk, Madame Broski. I love to rant about it with someone WHO GETS IT. Love."

63,"Yesterday,I had an interaction with a guy that I started to like. Somehow we got on the topic of who I voted for. I told him I voted for Kamala Harris and he told me “I hate women” because I voted for her. He doesn’t vote and I respected that and understood. I thought God forbid I have a little bit of hope in my vote. It really hurt and thought he was different. I cried all last night. I’m a 32 year old high school history teacher and I’m a smart, grown woman that thought long and hard about my vote. Thanks for saying that “having hope is brave” because I needed that."

0,"37:23 I was literally about to comment for you to be the suriel and then you said it. 

“I heard my trap go off, accompanied by a blood curdling scream, “biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch!”

Shivers ran down my spine as I approached, through the darkness of the birch trees I saw it. The Suriel. It was wearing a tattered moo moo, muddied from scavenging these rugged woods. Its hair tapes were showing but I tried to avert my eyes out of respect, it must have been a few too many months between appointments. 

“what the helly?”
Its voice coarse, laced with manic rage.
“I have come for answers,” my voice shaking, “please tell me what to do.”

The suriels face twisted into a horrifying expression, as if pleased with the shiver I received upon hearing its words.
“You must get crossfaded at mediaeval times-s,” it hissed, “AND- you need to trow an epic hissy at the airport.” 

thank you for reading. 2:12am 😭🫶"

0,"in reference to the whole ""why beauty"" thought experiment, my personal take is that beauty, or more accurately, the feeling of seeing and being enthralled with something 'beautiful' is simply the experience of love in the visual sense. its like the visual expression of love, like love seen through a 2d/3d lense of light and color and form.....

1,Serving eddie on the red carpet is crazy work. What a Queen
1,"""i don't like the idea that we think of art in the sense of consumption. what did you consume? consumption implies an ending. if you consume something, it implies there's none left, its disposed of, its finished. thats not what art does babes. thats not what an idea that blows your mind does, thats not what a song that speaks to you and tugs your heart strings does. thats not what a video that changes everything in your universe does. thats not what it does. you dont consume it. its not finished. in fact, its just getting started. If you are invited into a portal that feels heart-made for you, you just feel like woah, i belong here... that to me is this idea of art as a creative portal, and as artists, as the portals, to a more loving, more healed world."" -AYANDASTOOD"
0,"a quote i really love for you 
""remember the ripple effect of expression and creation. that you are a ripple. you have been effected by other creators and you effect, as above so below. continue the stream of expression."" -ayandastood"
0,"I'm obsessed with the fact that we see beauty in otherwise mundane things and wonder how other species react, for example, to a beautiful sunset or a perfectly symmetrical spiderweb. Did we evolve with this sense of seeking beauty, and if so, what was the purpose in our evolution other than just enjoying little things. Children have that innate sense of wonder when they see these things for the first time, that I think many people loose when they grow up, but reconnecting with it makes everything in life so much more vibrant and real, i'm sad for people who can't seem to notice the magic that nature creates."

1,"50:28 I will start by sharing that I am fully agnostic, leaning toward atheist, and in absolute adoration of science. That being said, the question of “why things are beautiful?” makes me ponder how humanity defined beauty. In the development of the idea of beauty, what option was there other than Mother Nature? The concept of beauty just makes sense for the things that give life, food, shelter, and dynamic stimuli. If the sky always looked the same, our eyes would have less stimulus to explore. As someone who is not religious, I just see it as such a wonderful product of science that our minds have found ways to latch on and love our Earth and the natural forces that flow across it."

In my reality at least it feels like it's so rare these days to see people  just as passionate and fangirly about classical art like painting as they are about modern art forms, like cartoons .. It's easy to lose the will to draw and dedicate time to it once you start focusing on studying, working and hustling for the sake of being ''more productive''..Anyways just thank you for what you do!

Since I have become the owner of this portrait, I have one only had dreams where I get kidnapped and or held hostage and two have been compelled to collect more old and possibly haunted things like glassware, portraits, dolls, masks, etc... so you know what do we think is going on there

she looks conventionally attractive, she is so skinny and she is so beautiful, so it comes off as just annoying when she says stuff like that. like she's has body image issues for no reason. i've been the same weight she roughly is throughout the years as she is now but it's like she became less relatable?? but i don't know how to get out of that mindset, because i love brittney, and it's so unfair to not like her stuff anymore just because she's healthier and taking care of herself. idk."

0,The Superman comics and most DC and Marvel comics in general were “woke” for their time. They specifically talked about hard issues that maybe parents weren’t talking to their kids about or didn’t know how. That’s why adults also found so much comfort in them because they talked about hard issues maybe they also were confused about but Superman made it simple. It’s good to see them returning these characters back to their roots.

0,Brittany you should look into the history of Tibet 🥲 and china's invasion of it in 1959🥲 India opened their borders for Tibetans to seek refugee despite only being independent for 10ish years.
0,I think it's the cambrige exam board that includes the britsh control over india in (english) history
0,"Hi Brittany, I absolutely love watching you break down art and your passion for history, humans, women, love, and emotion etc. I would love to hear you talk about ""The Lunatic"" by Hugues Merle  I discovered it today and it hits home for me in a way I cant bring myself to speak on. But I had one of those ""omfg I have no one to talk to about this"" moments. I stared into the womans eyes in the painting and it invoked so much emotion in me.. I would absolutely LOVE to hear your feelings about it so it can validate me crying alone in my office over it lmao. Thanks Queen"
0,I swear admiring history with broski would fix me because wdym I knew the citadel was a symbol for his hopes and dreams and the possibility of youth?? 🤨😏

0,Hearing Doncaster mentioned is such a jump scare every time
0,"Broski struggling with Yorkshire and UK places when I have lived in Leeds AND Reading really makes my day. I hate I won't be at the festival even though it's just down the road, I wish I'd known so I could see you! Thank you again queen, the UK real monarch"

0,"if you wanted to know more about india vs Britain (specifically the East India Company and its horrors) James Darwin's book ""empire"" is really fantastic and has a great chapter on india and the British treatment of Indians and religion"
0,"i was having a conversation with my friends a few weeks ago about how different the american mentality is to war. because american citizens have never experienced the trauma that comes from war happening in our country (aside from pearl harbor), we are quicker to get our consent manufactured for overseas conflicts"

0,"love woke superman, tired of capitalist beyoncé"
0,perfect. just finished my 9pm shift time to listen while driving home❤
0,"If you really want to learn about WW2 you shouldn’t only read history from English writer. 
Maybe expand and read also Japanese and German literature about this topic. So you can get a different point of view from various countries. It’s really interesting if you put everything together in the end and how everyone’s mind was working back then"
0,The liking being single because of being specific about how you sleep is so REAL!
0,"I witnessed the cowboy carter tour in london night 2. Truly a life altering event, say what you want about Beyonce, but that woman is out of her mind when it comes to perfoming live, the arrangements, the setlist, the interludes... We're just blessed to be living in the same time as her."

0,I keep seeing shorts of British people in public being asked if they feel proud to be British. Honestly don't know how anyone can say they are given the beyond horrible atrocities we've committed globally. I'm from England but I am not proud to be British at all. You say about the American education system but we don't even get taught the truth about our own history. It's very much pushed under the rug!
0,Malta gained Independence from the British in 1964!! Very devisive and unexplored topic within the conversation on empire and colonialism. But those damn brits stuck around as long asthey could

(Yes, I have back issues.) You find the right one and they just let you be! He’s my best friend and he’s also doing his own thing, I’m doing my own thing (it probably helps that we don’t have kids). I don’t know, you don’t need a man I just don’t want you to feel like it’s impossible and that you CANT have a man."

0,I just moved to a new country and listened to this while finishing my unpacking in my new room ❤️ thank u for ur service ma’am
0,"Wanted to add my interpretation of the last Thomas Cole painting to hopefully ease some of your own anxieties. I do think he’s ready as the first thing I noticed was how peaceful the water looked. Then there is the obvious path into the light amongst the stark darkness. What I think is most significant though is that he is not cowering away. He was looking away from the angel in adulthood. But now that he’s faced the light, he reaches up toward his death instead of attempting to flee away. As a nurse I know death is scary. But just know you’re doing the right thing by chasing your dreams and living your life to the fullest. These will be the things that will help you looking back with satisfaction and fulfillment. Try your best not to dwell, you are loved ❤"

0,"What a beautiful opportunity to be able to listen to a complete stranger talk about art as passionately as I, myself feel and struggle to verbalise. Thank you for this episode Brittany, your commentary on Thomas Cole's paintings was truly delightful. I am so happy for you that you get to share about your passions and the resources of that very passion. Sending love and I wish you an amazing day!"

0,"I love being here but sometimes, it really just feels like I'm being yelled at. heart rate very high."
1,I fucking loved loved loved the section on the Thomas Cole paintings. Your perspective is so refreshing and profound. “Why beauty?” LITERALLY! Life is so full of beauty and it’s impossible not to revel in its graces and wonder why
0,"I was just thinking earlier in the episode how grateful I am to have this show and feel understood and be able to relate to someone so much, especially as an adult whose friends have changed and we’ve disconnected over the years. And then the way you directly addressed that connection at the end brought me to tears. 
This is hope to me. It’s a reminder that beautiful people with open hearts and a curiosity and love for life and the earth still exist. ❤"
0,Finished this episode crying .. cool cool cool
0,I need someone to reply with the link to that mug
0,I live right outside of DC and have seen the voyage of life paintings in person bc they're at the national gallery of art and they're amazing! Photos don't do them justice. I didn't even remember they were Thomas Coles's until you started talking about it and showing them.

0,WHERE IS THAT COFFEE MUG FROM 😭
0,"That Goldilocks into was something truly special 😂 
If you want even more British colonial atrocities, look into the history of Australia. It’s completely vile and twisted what they did to the Aboriginal people and heartbreakingly, the institutionalised racism is still alive and well in this country!"
0,"A 1:10 
I am currently pooping 😂"
3,"The paintings are mesmerizing. It's amazing that I saw something completely different in them. In the depiction of manhood, he looks like he has regrets and is begging for something. Maybe he's asking for forgiveness. He no longer has the innocence and hope he once did. In the last painting, I think he’s happy that the angel came for him. He’s been waiting for her for a very long time. There’s a sense of relief on his face. He will finally be at peace when he leaves with her, with the hope of feeling the same way he did when he first came into this world with her, as shown in the first painting. I mean I love art. I love Broski Report. Thank you Brittany."

0,Thomas Cole’s goth brother: John Martin.
0,34:33 literally I always say I learned more on TikTok in three years than 15 years of American schooling because most of it is propaganda and TikTok is mostly information from all over the world and firsthand accounts so it's very accurate democratic information versus ironically schools that's why schools look like prisons because they're not actually trying to educate us. They're just trying to make workers i.e. slaves for their multi million dollar companies.
0,16:17 it's the f&@king scene at the end of the bee movie where they land the plane in the giant flower except it's beyonce in a flower of gays😂😂😂
0,13:20 I'm convinced that Beyoncé has already had a more positive impact on the world than the actual queen of England at 45 even in her entire reign honestly that's why she is the queen bee they say no kings but they never said no queens I wouldn't hate it if beyonce was our queen the uk had a worse one for much longer so I think we'd do okay
0,5:58 they even did this to the celts the brits are the roman and they were a warring empiric government so sad

I have my own thoughts on things like your videos, but I think I need to face the fact that I might still be too shy to put videos of my opinions out. I can write them out, but I sometimes feel delusional when I ramble lol."
0,"Love when you talk about recent book hauls/reads and art history!

0,"as a LOVER of world history, one of the hardest things for me to do was to acknowledge my love for a country and accept its brutality and past history. with the us, for example, i struggled for a long time loving the country because its history, foundation, and retelling has been tainted to say the least. however, i have learned to love what our country could become— it’s defo fueled a fight in me to make change and protest for what is right. we can be a country, not a congress; that’s what keeps me going! learning the history is so important because it helps us hold on to that hope while understanding the things we are currently going through. while history is bloody, good tends to prevail and it always starts with acknowledging the differences between groups of people ❤ as a strong left leaning person, i think what could unite us is love for a country and its potential— ik this sounds super optimistic, obviously change starts with ACTION, but i truly think it’s the way to keep hope during scary times like these"

0,"Brittany I beg of you, please do more art history episodes or continue on that little miniseries you were doing. I was just recently doing research for myself as an artist and was loving the Tomas Cole series just this last weekend! I would LOOOOOVEEEE it if you continues on with this because I truly think it will open up the opportunity for people to be more interested in dissecting and understand art... and also just how important it is for REAL and authentic art during a time period when any computer can display the prompt you ask of it and truly how important the artists of the world are. I love you so much and I hope to hear you analyze more artwork!!!"

0,"""some people love to shit!!"" Mind you I AM indeed shitting at this very moment"
0,"19:04 baby girl u look SOOO tea i need you to get your eyes checked. if i had that face card i would be insufferable. 

that aside, i think i wept a little this episode for a multitude of reasons. i have a sensitive heart for art and literature, so being able to hear your riveting commentary about Thomas Cole’s works really struck me. along with your passion for the TRUENESS of history, not the americanized history or the glorified history - what really happened. i find that so admirable as a fellow american, because we’re so used to hearing the buttered, sugar coated side of what WE did and what others “didn’t do”. im truly at a loss, because it’s almost an identical understanding that i hold in myself as a teenage girl growing up in america. 

i have the utmost respect you Miss Brittany. you are one of the only creators i can think of who has such a well rounded outlook on the world, while holding such innocence and youthful joviality for your work, your life, your hobbies and everything you pour your heart into. every episode is just such a blessing. not only for the times where you scream at us about men and your weekly musical rendezvous, but for the sympathy you have for EVERYONE. for the arts, for people in need, for the population of women.. what the fuck. im just endlessly astounded by how much you truly care, and how you spin your soul into everything that comes across you. not to mention how hilarious you are girl i have to take a bathroom break before i watch this fucking show 

let me shut up now if you give a shit. I LOVE YOU BABE BE GOOD SEE U NEXT WEEK 💋💋"

Critics often generalize the whole state as right wing monsters, but for many of us it's our home and we want so desperately for it to be a better place than it's become in recent decades. Gerrymandering and oil billionaires have deeply manipulated our politics. Texas is genuinely a beautiful and diverse place that we can't just throw away because of some evil, greedy, white men."

1,"People can get free automatic flood alerts through US Geological Survey WaterAlert. The alerts are based on current gauge data so it doesn't require anyone to press a button, it goes out automatically. It does take some time to set up ahead of time but could be worth it, especially for those who live in a floodplain. If local governments could help people figure out what to set the threshold at for their specific location that would be ideal."

1,I feel like it’s not that we should wonder why things are beautiful but more of why we find things beautiful because before humans existed and you know our kind of thinking do you think animals find beauty in those things or is it just their everyday life or is that the beauty in humans is that we can find the beauty in things

0,"Brittany I feel you, I had a YouTube channel that I actively used for like 5 months (ik not very long), I interacted with people who watched my videos and it was the most confusing and scary and comforting feeling I had known at once. Unfortunately. a fucing male backstabber deleted all my videos, got real sad and I went back to being me without posting. I was just done with it all at that point tbh but I digress. When I went back to just being a viewer, I really found how to cope with that confused feeling. What it stemmed from and what I was missing to link the parallel between the community and the host was thinking of your viewers like you just know them automatically. lol it sounds dangerous but hear me out. when you think of a close friend what do you think of? a memory right. Whenever I had a bit of a meltdown about why someone could possibly like my videos/had liked my videos, I think of all the moments where I shared a special moment with just myself and my camera. they shared that with me so I kept them in my heart in those moments. what your true fans love is quite literally everything you portray of yourself online. the REAL ones know that you have flaws but it doesn't out weigh the good, it just means you are a human fing being- people GENUINELY need authenticity right now so I would gamble they would love you even more irl. if u got all of broski nation together we would all be screaming overtop of one another, because we're all some variation of you lmao just one big friend group. you were the one brave enough and strong enough to start you own community. its a beautiful thing so don't let that damn imposter infiltrate your mind palace. peace and love<3 also sorry if this was goofy im off the eddiemame"

0,"Born and raised in the Hill Country of Austin, I go to A&M, and I truly do not see myself living in another place, because there is just no place like home. I see and feel frustration on your face about the floods and how not only Trump but Abbot as well handled this devastating situation. How Abbot saying his hands were tied and Trump signed a stupid piece of paper after the tragedy hit hundreds of families. And how are Texans still applauding him for that, he did nothing! Because where did Trump send the National Guard? Trump was more afraid about the political climate in LA than saving lives. For the National Guard of Mexico to step up and help when they are not welcomed, truly says so much. Thank you for the flood relief and Ice sources in your link. Keep doing what you are doing Brittany!"

It used to be a county (an area), like most things ending in 'shire' (Cheshire, Berkshire etc), but Yorkshire was so fecking huge that it's now split up into North/West/South.

2,"Some North East/Sam Fender/Newcastle education for you as a person who is from the North East of England! 
Sam is from a place called North Shields, which is not to be mistaken with South Shields. South Shields sits directly opposite, over the River Tyne. 
Sam’s accent is ‘Geordie’, the term ‘Geordie’ can also be used to describe someone that is from Newcastle or the surrounding areas.
The song you mentioned “Aye” is actually pronounced like how you would say the letter “i”. This means yes in the North East. 
To a person from the North East, calling places such as Liverpool/Manchester North is touchy, because for us those places are nearing on 3 hours away, so although they are classed as ‘North’ to a lot of Brits, to people from the North East it’s not! 😅
The North East is a BEAUTIFUL place that’s got a stunning coastline and heaps of history. The people are so kind and a lot chattier than when you go to London haha.
Hope this helped my supreme leader"

0,"I don’t know if earth was beautiful and then humans were made type thing. I think we as a species grew up on this planet, evolved if you will, and we evolved to find the earth beautiful because of what those moments bring us. 
Clear pink and purple and golden skies means good weather. Steady and blue water means life and safety and plenty. 

Sure pictures of the desert are pretty, but do you find cracked sandscapes to be as pretty as a lush field full of green bushes and trees? And sure a stormy sky is pretty, but it is as pretty as clear weather skies? 

I think we evolved to find the beauty in earth because of what that kind of landscape and sky meant to us as early humans.  I think you can even see it on a small scale. We find beauty in safety, familiarity, and comfort that only existed in our lifetimes too. My husband doesn’t think horses are particularly beautiful, but I grew up with them so I find them beautiful to me."

It could be my personal interpretation of Thomas Coles series, but the angel is only really there during infancy and on earth during childhood, but in the sky during adulthood and guiding to the sky at death. Im always going to be there but I will be different in his life. I'll be there at the beginning, I'll be there on the banks to see him go adventuring, I'll be there to watch him in the sky/from afar, and I'll be there when its time to rejoin. Thank you supreme leader for this beautiful exposure to new art. I love this new perspective you gave me."

You talk about the importance of community which I agree with, I believe we need to keep acting on that idea to heal. You’d be surprised with how much good can come out of asking your fans to join a community bird watch, garden, park, publicly funded museum, or farmers market. Maybe the Broski nation can have their boots on the ground in fixing our communities. 
(I’m not implying that you need to or have to, just a suggestion or idea!)"

The way they have these paintings set up is in a circular room, so the last painting almost flows back into the first representing the circular nature of life and creation. It’s so beautiful and moving. It’s in a really quiet wing of the museum so it’s almost like a meditation spot."

1,"Human evolved to see beauty in (healthy) nature because it meant that we were safe and we were in a healthy ecosystem, you find the clouds beautiful because having view of the clouds meant you were free (not held captive or trapped underground), and also had access to rain water and by extension the things rainwater sustains like plants and animals which you would need to eat to survive"

36,"10:22 as a huge swiftie I’ve been to both Cowboy Carter and Eras tour, and there’s no comparing it. The effort, the visuals, the vocals. The HISTORY. everything Beyoncé does is just another level. Taylor is amazing ofc but she’s a more intimate performer, completely different from Beyoncé. I don’t know why people EVER compare them, they’re both talents and they’re friends!"

11,"I talked to a woman yesterday (she's 50s/60s and black for context) and talked at length about how she dpesnt like Beyonce because nothing about her is original. She said she ripped off everything from her sound to her dance from past artists. She was rattling off artists who she got everything from. Not inspo... direct taking, like her single ladies dance. People called her a genius for that dance, uncontested... it was a direct copy from another artist."

35,"Thank you for talking about the floods in TX, you're the first person who's not a politician I've seen bring attention to them. It has felt so isolating - and in a weird way, a bit dystopian - to see everyone outside of texas carry on happily with their daily lives, parties, and sponsored posts while families and communities are being devastated. Simple acknowledgement can go along way, thank you ❤"

2,Maybe talk about beyonce calling native Americans anti peace?
0,THANK GOD
1,Brit if u are like wanting to know more about colonialism u should read this book called No Spiritual Surrender by Klee Benally. It's written by a Diné author and it exposes the way that the government in all aspects brutalizes natives for trying to protect the environment. It's all still happening. The author is from the region where I live and I just feel really strongly that what he has to say is important. He protested at the Dakota Pipeline along with many others and they got waterboarded on site and ended up developing a rapid and rare liver cancer. A LOT OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT GOT SPRAYED DID TOO. It's crazy to me that nobody talks about this. Like if that happened to white people way more ppl would know about it. Anyway No Spiritual Surrender is really well written and passionate and important especially with the way the government is rn.
6,I have 2 friends that went to Camp Mystic and survived the flood. It’s very tragic to what happened. More than 30 7-17 year old kids went missing and were found unalived from it. My heart goes out to those families and the other hundred families that lost people that week…😞😞

30,"10:50 YES, the propaganda interlude! she’s trapped in the house while the white doppelgänger takes over. the whitewashing of history and pop culture, the erasure of blackness, wrapped in the american flag, while she’s bleeding and crying. it gave me CHILLS."

0,"also, oh my god I am so glad you weren't caught up in the flood more. It's been horrifying even watching from DFW. I've had CA family call over to see we're safe and it's like OH.. DUDE, WE ARENT EVEN NEAR BY THAT... but that's how horrifying it is, it's scared the entire country. It's intensely tragic. I hope you're doing okay, man."

116,"Heeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Indian hereeee. Brittany, i would be remiss if I didn't correct your Punjab pronounciation. The Punjabis are on their way with their tractors I'm telling you. You know how you say, pun ? Like the thing of wordplay ? That's the pronounciation for Pun-jab. The second syllable was as correct as it could be. Can't speak for Bangladesh. On this side of Bengal , we call it Bangla-day-sh. But people from different parts, have different accents for that. But Punjab, I think has a pretty, standard pronounciation. So that's that. Thank you for finally posting the podcast . The car rides had been too safe for too long ."
0,Brittany you need to read some Kazuo Ishiguro! Would love your insights on The Buried Giant - reminds me of the painting so much with the boat life/death imagery 😭
13,being an anglo Indian and that being a byproduct of the british colonisation and hearing you acknowledge what Indian’s have gone through sent a shock through my system. it was so validating because my whole existence personally has been so confusing. not really knowing what culture or heritage to celebrate growing up takes a toll on you so the fact that you brought this us made me tear up. thank you supreme leader❤
0,Woah in ny they taught us all of that stuff about colonialism and stuff I knew there was a disparity but this would honestly explain why America cannot come together on certain things bc if they were taught this stuff we’d be fuming together ❤

0,The second you mentioned the crayon canvas it triggered a core memory of my first gf who made me exactly what you described. Under an umbrella 😂😂😂😂
0,"1. Truly i am thankful for you. 2. It IS refreshing to see someone that has more influence and a bigger voice to the public agrees with politics/men/the experience of being a woman that I, and many more of us experience. and 3. Azalea Wang shoes for some reason have never done me wrong. Highly recommend."
0,"When Brittany mentioned the millennial rainbow rain picture, I for real thought “girl, your romantic partner is gonna be the happiest person in the world” 😭😭😭"

0,"You gotta try the soundtrack of In The Mood for Love to play in the background, it’s a vibeee"
0,"Britney for #28 - I raise you Moroccan Black Soap & Exfoliating Hammam Glove. You take a boiling hot steaming shower. I’m talking the temperature of the sun. Wash with the black soap, rinse again boiling hot water and then scrub until you are pink. As hard as you can. All that reptilian coating melts off in CHUNKS. LITERALLY!!! I shedded 18 years of skin. If you can go to Morocco (highly recommended) and got to the Hammam go!! There are ladies in there who will scrub you within an inch of your life. I came out looking like a tomato. 🍅 😊 most Moroccans speak French and some speak English as well. The have spas too that will have the same thing but the authentic experience is the best. I lived there for years and feel in love and got me a man there too. The Moroccans are something special let me tell ya. I have been willingly adopted ❤ Dima Maghreb 🇲🇦"
0,Being weird is how my husband and I fell in love so quick. We both only had a month together… didn’t fake/pretend anything… then were like… FACK we gotta do this long distance. First guy that matched my freak and we be freakin seven years later heh heh

0,"Writing in books is one of the warmest feelings I get. I love buying gifts for people I care about but there’s something special about the little moment in time that it captures. I don’t know who started it or why but it’s an unwritten family tradition that if you gift someone a book you write a little message, the date and your name. Flipping through books in my relatives houses and seeing a little glimpse into who the people you love have been is one of the joys of my life. Yeah it marks the pristine nature of a well kept book but these people leave marks on our lives and that’s far more important to me than any unbroken spine or unbent page."
0,"Literally framing family pictures to put on my wall as I am watching this. And no, I did not know 😂"

I was mentioning you later and saying that you were so me... we then started an ongoing joke where you died in 2001 after holding up the twin towers with your bare hands to stop 9/11 from happening for eight hours sayinf ""NO!!! YOU CANT!!! ILL STOP YOU!!!"" and then a third airplane, being piloted by twilight sparkle and mordecai, flies directly at you, killing you through the jet fans.

0,I do drive with my knees often
0,9:16 might I suggest making your own bookmarks 👀 I like to get paint samples from Lowe’s or Home Depot and then make collages on the back! I use bookmarks to help me not skip lines or words while reading and the solid color of the paint sample  helps me not get too distracted as well! Plus you can pick a color with a name that associates with the book you’re reading

The brisket or whatever makes the whole place smell like cinnamon meat that's been left out on the parking lot. I have never enjoyed a trip to Bucky's but I'm so glad y'all made it a trend on t shirts. Also, I've heard it's clean (debatable) and the home decor section is usually Jesus coded and um TACKY sorry."

0,"Britney, my queen, do you want a tour of Medieval Times behind the scenes? Let me ask my boss, it would not be the first time. I think you would love it!! ❤️ (I would also love to serve you if you are ever near the Schaumburg Illinois location!)

I’m a “Castle Baby” my parents met working there and I work there now with my brother. I am seasonally working as I am in school at ISU, but I plan on rising the ranks when I graduate. The castle is my home and I am a huge fan of you. 
Listening to you talk so highly of the place is so nice and you are so right we LOVE loud guests!!! (Also the reason you can’t go by the net is not because you are in danger, the fights take place near the center so as long as you are not in the sand itself you are safe!! It is because the isles are for the servers as we have to move FAST throughout the show and vary very heavy stuff! Front row is the hardest to serve since there are several points throughout the show where we cannot serve front row specifically.)
Long Live Queen Broski!🐴⚔️"

0,34:00 To broskination if you don't know what to play ever my personal suggestion as some guy on the internet is: play acid jazz and swing jazz or just normal jazz but I think swing jazz is more fun for doing things around the house and/or game ost's if you don't like jazz in any way

0,"Day 1 of commenting random facts/mysteries until I confuse or freak Brittany out enough: 

In 1518, a bizarre episode of choreomania broke out in Stratsbourg, Alsace (City, Region of France), lasting from July to September (2-3 months)
This outbreak was one of the very few recorded cases of Choreomania as well as the best documented. Choeromania is the contagious mania of uncontrollable dancing.
Hundreds of people caught this “disease” and hundreds died of exhaustion and even stokes or heart attacks.
Historians have theorized that this “disease” was caused physiologically from social stress or ergot poisoning (hallucinogenic mold/fungus found on rye).
The dancers would dance non-stop, ignore pleas and even physical attempts to stop them, eventually dying.

533,"I agree with the dancing in public. I was getting gas at the gas station a few months ago and this big white car pulled up to the little convenience store behind the pumps. This guy got out - middle aged, greying hair, big tough looking guy. “I will survive” by Gloria Gaynor was playing on the speakers. This guy stops as he’s walking to the door of the building and starts dancing to the song. I’m standing at the pump and I can feel this shocked smile come over my face. His wife got out of the car and danced as she was walking to him. They laughed and went into the store. I felt like I could cry, I’ve never seen that kinda thing before - people just being happy in public. I think about it a lot."

0,"Hey Britanny! Long time listener second time commenter, for the last few episodes you have talked about spirituality and that stuff a lot, and coincidentally my mom has started her Numerology training and she has been telling me about it a lot and I have to say, you really need to look into it! What i got from my mom is that numerology is the belief that numbers derived from your name and birthdate carry symbolic meanings and influence a person’s life, personality, and destiny. She does some math with those numbers and says which of your numbers are ""empty"" which are supported by your past lives, which ones are karmic and so on, and all the numbers correspond to a chakra so its a way to also see which of your chakras are blocked.  Because she has the numbers in front of her she can pinpoint exactly whats up. You said the vagueness of these other stuff is annoying so numerology might help! Congrats on 100 eps!"

0,"Hey Britanny! Long time listener first time commenter, for the last few episodes you have talked about spirituality and that stuff a lot, and coincidentally my mom has started her numerology training and she has been telling me about it a lot and I have to say, you really need to look into it! What i got from my mom is that numerology is the belief that numbers derived from names and birthdates carry symbolic meanings and influence a person’s life, personality, and destiny. She does some math with those numbers and say which of your numbers are empty which are supported by your past lives, which ones are karmic and so on, and all the numbers correspond to a chakra so its a way to also see which of your chakras are blocked.  Because she has the numbers in front of her she can pinpoint exactly whats up. You said the vaugeness of these other stuff is annoying so numerology might help!"
0,BRITTANY SHUT UP YOU LOOK SO CUTE WITH YOUR CURLY HAIR AND LITTLE SPOOKY MUUMUU. I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

0,Oracle! At the Delphi
0,Opened up the episode and thought wow her hair looks so nice as she proceeded to talk about how much she hated her hair
0,"14:00 couldn’t be further from the truth. the gods and goddesses in the hellenic pantheon care deeply about humanity. their job is in fact to helps us evolve as a collective. with that being said, each of them have their own dark and light aspects. a lot of which become demonized and were taught to fear them in their darker sides. they don’t necessarily just cause bs just purely out of boredom. there ARE some trickster deities who like to chaos a bit of harmless chaos such as Loki from the norse pantheon, but loki also has a serious side to him, and helps those who seek his aid. the idea that greek gods just exist to be nuisances who dont care about us humans is just a lack of understanding! i say this not to be hateful by any means! but just to help others understand. the more you get to know these deities, research them, work with them, etc, the more you realize how little we actually understand about them! the mythologies aren’t to be taken literal as they are meant to teach us lessons about the gods roles. for example, the story of persephone being kidnapped by hades and taken to the underworld, Hekate (greek goddess of cross roads, transitional/liminal space, and the torch bearer ( light bringer), helps guided persophen through the darkness of the underworld to then become queen of the underworld. this story teaches us that the goddess persephone and hekate  can help you work through your own darkness (traumas and shadow work) and become your own “queen of the underworld” which would be triumph over trauma as healing. zeus, although known as a womanizer, as king of the gods, he can teach us to be strong, stand in our power, be authoritative and protect the ones we love. apollo can help us get ion tough with our creative side, bring light to the truth of a matter, help us recover from depression, and more. their traits that you read about in this episode have much more to do with the role they play as gods and helping humanity."

0,"14:39 WATCH EPIC THE MUSICAL, IT SQUEEZES BASICALLY THE WHOLE ODYSSEY INTO A BANGER MUSICAL"
0,talk about the burning of Alexandria library
0,"In my jouney to get tf off my phone, the first step was deleting tiktok. That was also the hardest step for me. The next step was condensing any apps that are on my home screen to only the apps i'm okay with myself going on. Any other apps that i dont use on the daily and am happy with get removed from the home screen and are only in my app library. Eventually I took it a step further and redesigned my app icons to be bland and black and white so that theres no dopamine hit when i open up my phone and see all the apps there, just b&w icons and i have to look for what i'm actually going for. At the same time, I made a big effort in my life to try and do things off of my phone that i would usually do on it. wanna watch youtube? do it on a computer or tv. wanna send an email? hop on the laptop. wanna listen to music? play a cd or use an mp3 player (i have those, not to say you have to). This just slowly moves my brain into expecting something thats NOT THAT GOD DAMN PHONE when I have a need (especially for entertainment). I also try to pair this concept with hobbies i enjoy. I try to listen to music while doing something fun/ active like taking my dog on a walk/ going skateboarding/ bike ride/ etc. If I put on youtube/an easy watch tv show like the office, I try to also do a hobby task like crochet or journalling or even doing an easy chore like dishes or laundry or cleaning up stuff around the house. Now I've been really considering moving to a phone (NOT AN AD I SWEAR) like Minimal phone where i still have full app access but the hardware and software encourages me being in control of how much I want to be on my phone. As opposed to how Apple/ most smartphones are intended to try and hold my attention for as long as possible. This obviously isn't necessary or viable for everybody, but I think it's my next move when it feels like the right time, I'm still coming around to parting ways with iphones because I've been on one since I was like 12 💀."

0,"Just speaking from my experience , be careful with intaking lots of readings via TikTok, especially twin flames, soulmates. The algorithm and some of these readers are really powerful and can make things sound realllllly convincing and relatable. I literally sent myself into an almost two year psychosis started and worsened by TikTok readings. I saw “signs” and angel numbers everywhere and It was the only thing I could think about all day everyday. I still use tarot but if you are vulnerable it can get scary and dangerous fast. I started an anti psychotic as well as lots of unlearning and was able to wake up from it but it was one of the worst times of my life…"

0,"Carrie should never have gone back to Big. That one scene where she screams at him and then says something like “don’t call me anymore, why don’t you forget I exist…” I’m like that’s really where it should have actually ended. Was always disappointed they ended up together. And Just Like That is really not worth watching, tbh.. the magic that once surrounded the original show is totally lost on the remake. It feels like when they tried to reboot Arrested Development but now instead of being the Straight Man, Michael is the crazy. One In this case, it’s the reverse, Carrie is somehow the voice of reason..? Don’t think so."
0,Please youtube i beg for a variety of ads
0,"For Brittany or whoever else is struggling with a phone addiction, here's the compromise I made with myself to ease into things: 
I don't think phones are inherently bad, I just think we use them poorly. So, I deleted the apps that I was spending too much time on (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) from my phone. I try to keep my phone just as the tool I feel like it should be (communication, music, maps, etc.). However, I haven't completely cut off my access to the bad apps. I can still get to them on my iPad or my laptop. I was really having a problem where I was going on these apps on my phone out of habit and then spending countless hours on there, but now I have to be more intentional about it. I don't take my iPad or laptop with me so it's only something I can do at home, which keeps me present when I'm with friends/family. I will admit that I have started spending more time on my iPad so I think I am going to delete them from there as well so that I can only access them from my laptop. And I'll tell you that scrolling does not feel as rewarding on the laptop lol.
My goal is to get to a point where I only get on social media to intentionally check or post something, not to doom scroll. I think everyone should try a day without a phone but if that stresses you out too much, try this! It may not be the end-all-be-all solution, but it's a step in the right direction."

0,"Brittany I'm not a doctor but as a fellow woman I'd encourage you to talk to your doctor about PMDD. A dumbed down version is that its like a very bad form of PMS. How you described and talked about your cycle sounds similar to what I went through. I ended up getting an IUD which helped IMMENSLY. Anyways, love you!"
3,"18:07 wym you don't want your partner to also be your best friend?! That's the best part of having a partner is that you actually want to hang out with them, sleepover every night. There is a probability of you finding someone out there that you love both romantically and platonically, and it's honestly not a far stretch from the spiritual signs, because maybe you'll find a friend and build that strong bond first before diving into the relationship?? a slow burn? idfk i'm high. anyway normalize being bffs with your s/o"

0,"Not sure if this is great advice or anything, just personal experience. But, I got an Apple Watch and it has helped me stay off my phone so much. I also have anxiety when I’m off my phone, but I can just glimpse quick at a notification on my watch to see if it’s something really important, and if not I just continue reading or whatever I was doing. I can even see a little few second gif of any ring notifications, and what a game changer! Again, I’m no expert or anything, but it has helped me a lot."

0,"A fun fact Brittany, I think, and I find  your interpretation on the verse ¨Lluvia de estrellas; yo me transformo¨ as a literal starfall poetic, Rosalia might be alluding to a Spanish TV show that was popular on the 90s called ¨Lluvia de Estrellas¨ where non-celebrity guests dressed as famous singers would cover their songs, hence the ¨transformation¨ she refers to.

1,I be throwin hissys alone at the kitchen sink for sure
0,"supreme leader, if i may speak, as someone who has also gone though/is going through this, smoking weed when you’re at all spiritual makes it /reeeaaallly/ easy to slip into spiritual psychosis since you feel like you’re out of your body and floating and the whole world makes sense because everything is repeating yada yada, but it’s because you’re getting stuck in a spiral of your own thoughts and  the weed makes it word in my experience. like i always have a moment when i green out where i feel completely separated from my body and get scared but then i remember im high and it kinda snaps me back into my body. but it’s still /terrifying/ to experience."

0,Brittany's gutteral screaming is the perfect encapsulation of female rage.
0,"Hello supreme leader, I’m a silent but dedicated fan. If you need a break you gotta take one and don’t worry about us.

I have a Kermit phone like your Mickey phone and bought s landline bluetooth adapter! If someone calls my cell, it rings through the landline. You can also call out from the landline and it goes through your phone. If there were an emergency, my people know to call and they can catch me on the Kermit phone. Lol. It really has helped!"

0,"I recently learned that people with ""strawberry skin"" aka keratosis pillaris (KP) have a striking lack of sebaceous glands in affected areas, meaning you literally cannot produce oils in those areas. Among other skin abnormalities.

Exfoliating doesn't fix that, and can make the irritation and bumps even worse. Please for the love of God be gentle on your KP skin, use jojoba oil (most similar to your natural skin oils) and keratolytics (urea or lactic acid for example) and don't pick at it!

People who dont have KP don't get what its actually like and they almost always give bad advice. Our skin is just different, and its genetic. Dollar store lotion wont fix it, and intense exfoliation makes it worse. I'm getting annoyed actually thinking of the dumb advice I've heard about my skin!"

0,MY MOM IS GOIGN TO IRELAND IN AUSUST. You’re gonna fall in love with my mom
1,"i’m 17 and I went to a residential treatment center for about 4 months. I had extremely severe anxiety and depression and some bad ocd and bpd traits as well as some adhd and executive dysfunction problems. I didn’t have my phone for a little over 2 and a half of the months I was there. and when I did get it, it was from 7:30pm to 9:00pm every night, but only if I went to all my groups and did everything I was supposed to do. the first few weeks were one of the hardest things i’ve ever done in my life. I was fine for maybe 2 days without my phone, and then I started panicking. I was only allowed 3 call nights a week, and I would only get 15 minutes per call. and everyone I called had to be on my approved call list by my parents. I also had family therapy, but not being able to call my mom for help when I needed it was excruciating. I have my phone now (obviously), and still struggle with addiction issues. I remember turning my phone in at night and getting withdrawals almost immediately after. it’s crazy how fast we get addicted to our phones. there are 3 main things that helped me stay sane during this period. 1: friends. being around people all the time and doing arts and crafts or therapy or puzzles together was extremely helpful. my favorite times were when my and my roommates would talk for hours at night just having fun. 2: distractions. I had an mp3 player that had over 3,000 songs on it and multiple playlists for my music. it also had a voice recording feature so I would create podcasts in my room when I was bored and needed someone to talk to. I also took up reading. i’ve always been a reader, but the amount of books I read was INSANE. in my free time, instead of wanting to scroll on tiktok, it changed to me just wanting quiet time to read my book. I would read for hours, and I honestly miss that so much. 3: learn to sit with your thoughts. I went to a place where the modo was quite literally “sit with it” and I thought that was bullshit until after I went there. sitting with the anxiety is SO hard, and took me a lot of practice. but being able to watch a movie and form my own opinions on it instead of going on tiktok or letterboxed or youtube reaction videos was so helpful. it helped me form who I actually am as person, without other people’s constant input changing me. now, I try to make time every day to spend time not on my phone and do something I love, like singing, dancing, acting, or writing. I wrote in my journal almost every day at residential. I try to wash dishes in complete silence now, or something similar. distractions like your phone don’t stop your thoughts, they just suppress them, so whenever you don’t have stimulation, all those suppressed thoughts jump out at you at once and overwhelm you until you seek comfort in your phone again. but sitting with it and taking time not on your phone lets you not be overwhelmed by thoughts, because they come and go naturally throughout the day like they’re supposed to. I never get overwhelmed with them because i’m not suppressing anything. my anxiety was so much more at ease without my phone. of course, I wanted to take photos, but I brought my polaroid camera. all this to say, breaking a screen addiction is very challenging work, especially if your whole life is on there, but it gave me opportunities to create a whole life outside of what’s on my screen. i’m much better equipped to form a thought and makes decisions more coherently now. i’ll never regret those months without my phone!!"

0,"45:15 had this exact mentality a WEEK before I met my boyfriend, who is in the simplest terms; the most perfectly compatible human to me. Literally we joke that we manifested each other because of how many things we have in common or have experienced that led us to each other. The easiest decison of my life to let myself be in love with him and let him love me the way i always wanted. It'll come girl."

0,"brittany reading general readings and then getting mad when they're generalized is so funny girl PLEASE just go get a 1 on 1 reading w a tarot reader. I am literally a professional reader I will do it for FREE u just need a 1 on 1 😭 general readings will always be general bc its a reading of the energy affecting EVERYONE on earth, they will literally never feel specific unless the energy is affecting u VERY strongly and will only make u more anxious bc they're so unspecific"
0,40:48 marking it :) hope it’s something absolutely amazing ❤️
0,35 minutes of me waiting for her to finally read about the damn Cancer new moon

0,its insane how much i relate to brittany every week SWANS check SPIRITUAL PSYCHOSIS check SOMETHING IN THE AIR check
0,"to be serious for a second, the part where you talk about phone addiction made me feel seen 😭 my job is also on my phone & social media. I would love to delete tiktok & insta like all the self help articles recommend, but I literally can't even if i wanted to. Something that's helped is being more aware of what I'm watching. Like I'll be in the middle of another brainrot video and think ""do I even care about this."" Also, being aware of what I'm giving up to watch the slop. like ""does this video matter more than spending time with people/self care"" etc. Not a perfect solution, but it helps. Also, trying to plan as many irl things as possible, socializing a lot & going places that force you to be in the present. Anything that keeps your hands busy and not holding the phone, and you've committed to it by either paying, or promising people you'll be there."
0,U look like Katya in a Carrie Bradshaw wig today

0,lmfaoooo the first 5 minutes 😂
0,"Ok, no one is going to stop being addicted to their phone as long as being available to people 24/7 remains normalized. that’s not a normal thing! it’s ok to go a full day without responding to someone if it’s not an absolute emergency, it’s ok to see a DM late, it’s okay to miss calls because you’re doing something you enjoy doing like reading or you just don’t feel like talking. put that shit on do not disturb!  our phones have given us all anxious attachment styles in a way and now for some reason everyone thinks they need to be available to everyone at any time all the time, via their phone/social media/etc, and that’s just not normal. additionally, we all have started to think that we NEED to know what’s happening in the world all hours of the day, what everyone is talking about, what is going on in the news, but we don’t need to know ALL THE TIME. yes we should be informed especially in this day and age but it’s okay to take some time away from all that chaos every once in a while. keep trying brit! and everyone else! plus, to disconnect and reclaim our attention and creativity from the tech billionaires that robbed us is an active act of revolution at this point! it’s hard but we can do it yall :)❤"
0,32:02 remindes me of Will Ferral in Anchorman 😆

0,glad I'm not the only one having a hissy fit today but I truly empathize supreme leader
47,we need to re-stigmatize ad reads because i fear an hour long podcast episode shouldn’t have an unskippable ad every five minutes in addition to in-video ad reads
0,Emma Chamberlain mentioned how she deals with phone addiction. One phone is work-only. No fun apps. And the other phone has the fun apps. Maybe that would help!

0,"23:14 Brittany, you’ve got to get the Apple Watch. I wear it around and put my phone in the other room, that way I’m not sucked into doomscrolling while I’m trying to work, but if someone texts/calls I can see it on my Apple Watch and go get my phone to reply. seriously it helps me balance be reachable while also not being on my phone all the time"

0,The ads are fucking diabolical.
0,"22:39 Brittany- read digital minimalism by cal Newport and do a digital detox month. 
Tell us to keep you committed to it!! It’s a difficult process but not impossible. cal’s approach to it is a bit intense compared to other works about how our attention is being capitalized. But it’s a good place to start. 
Maybe try doing it with a friend, that made it way easier for me! 
I think it would really help with your mental health, as it did mine 💕💕💕"
0,43:00 I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHO HE FROM IRELAND ISSSSS
6,i was diagnosed with PMDD because my periods sent me into depression and anxiety spirals for 2/4 weeks a month and i would spend the other 2 weeks trying to pick up the pieces of what i had self sabotaged but then the next period would come and it would all happen again. needless to say i take the pill all through the month now and i only have a period for 3 days every 4 months to try to regulate how volatile my PMDD makes my emotions lol. i think mama broski should ask her doctor about it
1,"There’s something I’m curious about. Can someone explain to me how people say they don’t trust/believe in God (or say that a being like that can’t exist), but trust/believe in things like tarot, astrology, psychic readings, etc.? I’m genuinely curious about the thought process in that. Prefer answers from people who actually know the faiths and/or understand the the things listed, not just assumptions"
0,BRITTANY…. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOIT VEDANTA SOOOOOO MUCH…. RAMAKRISHNA IS AMAZING AND YOU SOUND MORE AND MORE LIKE A VEDANTAN THE MORE YOU CRASH OUT
0,You had me scream crying multiple times this episode hahahaha im the same way throughout the month

1,do not use costar that app is just straight bs. i like sanctuary bc i can actually understand what their saying and it doesn’t feel as vague and lowkey toxic as costar. there are prob better apps out there but i think sanctuary is good for people who are newer to astrology!!

Physical books before bed! And honestly it’s changing my life and I’m so exited to see that like within the week like so many people are like simultaneously doing the same thing. It’s kinda crazy that we all decided at the same time to get off our phones this summer
0,14:53 I just went to Greece as a part of my Greek Myth class in college and we were in a town on the same day that they were filming bits of the Odyssey! It was crazy seeing all the ships!!

2,"So I quit TikTok, Instagram and facebook  2 years ago this summer and switched to only using Pinterest and YouTube and it honestly was enough to make such a difference in my mental health, so maybe try one day a week no socials but you can still use your phone to contact people you need to and take pictures, listen to music even a podcast, ya know all the wholesome things that actually apply to your life. This really helped me and I never returned to the other socials so if it helps!"

I stay here cause I’m afraid of being financially unstable but I fear I reached a point where I have exhausted everything and I just don’t give a fuck anymore. I go in late, I hardly show up.

1,ur periods coming girl you’ll feel better
0,11:21 i did once and ended up sitting through a session where they were preaching about the sins of homosexuality and how gays are one of the problems in this country right now. I think the economy is one of the biggest problems in this country and its funny how these churches get money for free to wage culture wars based on magic. Man is standing up there salaried to brainwash people.
1,Seeing our supreme leader at Leeds fest this year was not on my bingo card I am SHOOK 🤠
0,"The Irish song at the end reminded me of this new song by For Those I Love, ""Of the Sorrows"": https://youtu.be/mp-f6cG6rco.

0,"Lol so what you are asking for is a man who is self assured and secure. Thats a fair thing to ask, and now that you know what to look for (from experiencing what you DONT want) youll never have to waste your time again. 
You deserve a healthy relationship, and you value yourself enough to hold out for that. I believe your patience will be rewarded :) ❤

Ps, thats part of the decernment you talked about, knowing whats for you. You already know whats for you, all you have to do is pay attention to see if you recognize those things. Always check in with what your body feels. Your gut feelings can't lie to you. ❤❤❤"

0,Also woman by Mumford and sons was my 1st dance song at my wedding. That song makes me sob
0,"@BroskiReport should read the poem ’Leda and the Swan’ by William Butler Yeats. It’s a sonnet about the Greek myth story, but there’s a very unsettling juxtaposition of the imagery of the beautiful swan and its gruesome, animalistic sexual assault done to Leda. As a result of this, it’s also a precursor to the Trojan War as Leda gives birth to some of the main characters of Homer’s epic. Also, Yeats is Irish so she can read it in an Irish accent!"

0,"if anyone wants to come back to the church don’t let anything stop you! there are many ways of viewing God and interpreting God’s teachings. However, it is  universally accepted that God is love and everything he does is in love. He was sad to see you leave the church, but wants you to be able to follow your heart and will always want you to return. personally I find a lot of comfort in Christianity with knowing billions of people have prayed the same prayers and heard the same teachings because it helps connect me to my ancestors and others who lived before me"

0,"My advice for you supreme leader: 2 phones, work and personal. You can have limited hours of access for you personal phone and also keep social media on there. Personal, suuuuuper minimal. Only have contacts and media that is not short form (netflix, hulu, even pinterest and tumblr). And finally, make time in the morning to check the news for anything you feel is important. Cut back SLOWLY. Limit from 8 to 6, then 4 etc. Thats all!"
0,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASSSSEEWE COME TO BELFASTTTTTTPLEASEEEEEEE❤❤❤❤
0,"As a practicing witch member of broski nation: co-star is hot garbage and fyp tarot reads prey on your insecurities. They’re also a reading “for the collective” which means they are very impersonal, if not outright scammy. Like no shit most people are going to meet someone in July, it’s fucking summer lmao. You’re more likely to be outside and social than ever. If you want an accurate reading, have one of your friends do it or do it yourself! There is absolutely nothing scary about tarot, it’s like old timey Google that uses your intuition as a guide. It’s a magic 8 ball before they had those. It’s a tool to understand yourself and your surroundings, nothing more nothing less. For astrology, not to be an oldhead but cafeastrology never fails. Love ya! ✨"

1,"Just delete TikTok. Delete it. Take it off your phone. Go a week without it. When you get it back youll notice how miserable everything is on there. How sad people are. How mean. Just delete it then you can’t relapse without downloading the app, waiting for it to finish, opening it and pressing past all the tuts. It makes you stop and think. I swear I SWAR"

Thank you, 
A loyal subject."
0,I NEED Brittany to watch/listen to EPIC sooooooooo bad!😖
1,"Honestly about the no phone situation, like fr we can’t and aren’t able to be present in society without a phone anymore. At this point, at least 97% of all of us are forced to rely on these rectangle, soul sucking mini computers for life, it’s sad because it’s not in our nature at all but it’s not up to us to change that at this point. We never really did chose to get addicted to these devices (If you think about it)"
0,"I think you would enjoy reading about exoplanets and the moons of Jupiter, my two favorite astronomy topics!"

0,the first ten seconds of this has been me all week. you are a blessing thank diva. throw that hissy
0,"Honestly the thing that changed my life and my health and my mental health the most is: eating to my blood type. I doubt youll see this Supreme leader, but to anyone in the comments; try it. Research your blood type and try to eat to what your blood needs. Obviously its not black and white, but it makes sense from the perspective of if youre giving your blood what it needs to thrive and avoiding things that your blood isnt compatible with,, the less issues youre bound to have all around. Its so wild and it makes me angry that doctors dont tell people about this."

0,you should use time passage for astrology instead of costar
0,"20:00 . about a year ago I deleted everything other than YouTube and Pinterest from my phone and THAT was life changing enough. a couple of weeks ago i deleted the final 2 from my phone. i truly cannot trust myself around short form content. i will drown myself in meaningless dopamine before i will get up and actually do what i said i was going to do. I'm going through my own anti-rot summer, but my motivation is almost purely to stop letting other people, me included, down. i got tired of telling people that i didn't get to whatever task i said i would do for them, and i was tired of rolling my eyes at myself for not staying on top of my personal tasks like cleaning/ self-care. 
this isn't a complete blackout though, obviously I'm on here harping about my own decisions to people on the internet. just having that sticky barrier of having to go all the way across the room to get my laptop, open the screen, load a browser, etc its enough to get me to stop and clock tf in and realize I'm only reaching for my screen because im stalling before i go do what i need to do. 
I'm a nutritionist and preach about moderation all day to my clients, and there's still alot of disconnect with people understanding their relationships with food, a situation where addiction and self-destructive behaviors are incredibly well documented and fairly easy to diagnose.  ive really been clocking the uncontrollable sickness and addiction people have around the internet and the constant need for a feed. it truly feels like no doctors are talking about this, it's not a medically recognized addiction for some reason and it's not even considered a disordered lifestyle.  I'm sure this is a contributing factor to why more people aren't realizing what kind of genuine rock bottom screen addictions can bring you to and that its NOT NORMAL. i truly had a withdrawal period with my phone and had to treat myself like i was in detox from something- because i was- and to see myself truly tweaking because i didnt hear some dumb soundboard with a poorly rendered frog animation on a big ass screen 1"" from my face- I WAS SO EMBARASSED.

if you think you can take it seriously and not give up i couldn't recommend it more. ive read 2 books over 500 pages between the end of may and now. like??? there's nothing that shows you how much time you really have than not continuing to literally waste HALF OF IT doing something that accomplishes NOTHING."
0,I love her but absolute silence on what’s going on in LA is crazy..
0,SAOKO PAPI SAOOOKOOOOOO
0,"Any other women late 20s to early 30s watch sex in the city for life and dating advice, and then by the end of it be even more confused with life and dating. Existentially pissed off at Carrie for letting a man control her life, SEVERALLY PISSED OFF about how all of her friends acted so happy when she announced the marriage instead of looking her in the eyes and telling her to GROW UP AND DUMP THAT MAN 😭 all I’ve learned from that show and the movie is to never depend on a man 🤮"

0,I'm so excited to see who the king of Broski nation will be 😊
0,"okay brittany i think you would really like this book called ""that all shall be saved"" by David Bentley Hart a professor at yale. it's a book on universalist christian theology and it's really well researched. i've been feeling really existential too and while i have stuck with my faith after deconstruction, i still really struggle with the idea of hell. he argues against the way that scriptures have been interpreted in the west for the last millennia and i haven't finished it yet, but it feels very empowering and unbiased <3"

Anyways I can’t hear that song without thinking about the song from the man in the bathroom with all the mirror around him, the beat and the rhythm of the songs are too similar and I’ve been emotionally scarred by that short film 😂😂😂😂"

0,16:01 isn’t twin flames a cult??
0,My gf and I are zodiac twin flames ❤ we understand each other on another level and it’s so fun being best friends and romantic partners
0,"As a woo woo girly you gotta combine tarot with astrology. And astrology is only vague because you’re lookin up the general horoscope, so it’s going to generalize the interpretation. You have to see where the planets are falling and how that COMBINES with your birth chart to get something that’s going to be more specific to you. The easy first step of that is seeing which house it’s in for you. (Each house centers around a theme in your life) so you do that by having your rising sign and all of the houses after that will follow the order of the zodiac 1-12. Whatever transitting planet you’re looking at, for example this cancer new moon, will be in whatever house is cancer in your chart- that is where the themes of the new moon will manifest, in that area of your life. That goes for ALL of the planets, so it can get very complex! Hope this helps you understand how to make it more specific supreme leader."

Bro literally everything you’re saying & I feel for you so deeply. It’s such an uncomfy feeling to wake up and feeling bombarded with this fear of ?? WHAT??? 

I feel like I’m not slowly coming to the other side of things and truly,,,,, I did shed an old version of myself that fr based EVERY SINGLE DECISION OFF OF FEAR. My advice would be to lock in on a therapist u can trust that offers EMDR / somatic healing (trust u are too smart for talk therapy) and read the Power of Now and every time fear or worry or guilt or shame comes up, know that it’s just ego!! And u don’t have to let ego run ur life! I sound crazy I hope u see this 🤠"

0,"i follow and worship’s Greek Gods and honestly they’re wonderful. i’ve never felt more supported, accepted, and loved by a higher being before. i was raised Orthodox Christian and i experienced so much religious trauma and let down by God. when i first started exploring religions and finding my spirituality, and i started reaching out to Gods, they answered IMMEDIATELY. they answered and were there, and it is absolutely wonderful. the myths are honestly just metaphorical lessons and are supposed to be used as such, not taken literally, like how Christians do with the bible. researching about the religion/spirituality is so wonderful tbh."

0,I love how half the episode was in an angry monster voice 😭😭
0,"You can ask ChatGPT why you keep seeing swans! If you talk to it often and it picked up some data on you, it might be able to tell you something that resonates with you. It works for me sometimes haha it helps with dream interpretations too if I’m struggling to understand something."
54,Truly appreciate the realness you have especially about talking phone addiction and screen time. I easily clock at LEAST 10 hours a day

0,I’m in a bad mood today too sister
0,Love u!!! sorry you’re bleeding 😢
0,"As someone who isn't overly addicted to my phone (though sure i do rely in my phone and would struggle without it), I'd say that going cold turkey is 9/10 times not going to be sustainable. I don't work from my phone like you Brittany so my situation is different, but I'd say replacing times when you would reach for your phone just to fill empty times or cure boredom with slower activities, like reading, drawing, crocheting, heck even colouring in, really does help. Anything that slows you down.

I really like youtuber Leena Norms' attitude of Half Arsing things, instead of setting ourselves unsustainable painful goals - it's more sustainable to do half or a smaller amount of something than the whole task every time, and something you are likely to keep doing in the long run, if you do it in small increments as opposed to not going on your phone for an entire day. 
It's finding what method works for you in terms of reducing screentime, and as someone who relies on their phone for work like Brittany does, I'd say reducing screen time in little choices throughout the day, instead of removing it completely, feels more sustainable.

I've replaced screentime with reading before bed, which helps me get to sleep much better.

On another note, I find I get anxious and fidgety when I multitask too often (for eg, having a video playing in the background while doing tasks that need my full attention)."
0,"hello! I suggest reading ""Stolen Focus"" by Johann Hari. It changed my life. I deactivated my social medias in Feb (I know not possible for you :/) but it has helped so much. I haven't gone back. My screen time went down by 50% or more."
1,"You keep seeing numbers and animals cause you may be thinking about it. I notice the same happens to me, the more I pay attention to something or think about it, the more I attract it 😅 lately I’ve been seeing lots of numbers and attracting lots of baby deers and dolphins too. But sometimes it do be coincidental. And maybe the universe is trying to communicate with us through numbers, symbols and stuff 🤷🏻‍♀️ I believe everything is an energy. It reminds me of like when you think about something and suddenly get an ad about it on social media.. like HOW?!? 👀"

1,Stop consuming lots of spirituality content! That’s why you’re disconnected from your intuition 😭 try to connect with yourself and do some journaling or laying down and resting and letting your mind wander a bit. I do that when I feel disconnected from myself and it helps.. it might help you too.

3,"I think it helps to instead of thinking you're addicted to the phone, to start thinking you're addicted to something IN your phone. Maybe it's codependency to other people or something else or nervousness about shutting yourself off from the unknown you otherwise couldnt reach, who knows. A phone is just a tool of the addiction. Atleast that helped me, to start thinking that way."

6,"56:04 CHURCH!!!!!!! Thank YOU Queen you are saying what we ALL  beeeeen thinking. I think the writers are purposeful with Carries actions because we all can see parts of ourselves in her so it’s infuriating watching her make ~those~ decisions with/for Big.  When we’re in the trenches of a toxic relationship, those ridiculous actions we huff and puff about as  viewers don’t seem so outrageous. Carries character kind of forces a mirror to us all as women who compromise our self-worth and morals for the validation/approval/attention/affection/acceptance/“love” of a man and says, “look how absurd this is.”"
1976,did anyone else get like 12 unskipable ads for the M3gan movie

0,COSTAR IS BAD!!! There were all these messed up interviews during the pandemic with the CEO. She’s a psycho!! They put out weird messages on the app ON PURPOSE. Also they use a really weird house system that most notable western astrologers don’t. Weird all around.

36,"18:16 Brittany is so real for this. For the past decade, I’ve been letting people know where I’m at, straight up. I’m not people pleasing anymore. That doesn’t mean I’m not kind to people. I’ll always treat people with kindness and consideration, but too many people I’m forced to live with act like I have to bend over backwards for them to make them happy, when they’re never going to be happy, regardless of how much I do for them."

Anyone who has seen Wallace and Grommit would know that the moon is made of cheese. Probably Jarlsburg as it is delicious and naturally lactose free. What goes well with Jarlsburg? Plum paste, that's right. So plum ice cream would probably be good with Jarlsburg. But it would have to be a nearly even ratio for it to be good. Hopefully Ben and Jeremy see this"

She also breaks down the astrology for each week and will even do it for your specific chart.

0,"My interpretation of Brittany's reading: A man (who Brittany is not currently open to) will come into her life and will shake up Brittany's perception of love. He wont be her imagined perfect person.. which will allow her to look past the expectations and transform herself with all new revelations.


Personally experienced something somewhat similar so lets see... maybe all that comes out of this reading is a new song."

1,"54:00 you NEED to read ""Daughter of the Forest"" by Juliet Marillier. It is from a Celtic legend about a woman whose family gets turned to swans and she has to see six shirts from stinging nettle plants to break the spell. Of course enemies to lovers is in there as well. And it has sequels!"
0,"I can physically feel your anxiety and you’re grasping at anything you can because your soul feels how far away from God you are. You’re longing for something more, some certainty, some prediction, for the supernatural. Your beliefs thus far have not helped you and instead you have crippling existential panic and anxiety. You’re feeling so far from God. The true God. Not the church of man or religion of man. The God of the Bible, which is a historical text with cross referencing and coincides with other historical texts. I know that you know that there is a creator, and there is so much meaning and history that Gods people have forgotten and they have been thoroughly brainwashed. There is so much hope, love, and peace to those who dwell in the secret place with Jesus."
4,Concerned you didn’t open with a YABADABAHDOO
3,Girl when you said what day it was my jaw dropped. I had the WORST day yesterday

150,"23:17 commenting to give advice about what changed the phone addiction for me—24/7 do not disturb! (Other than my sister, bf, and parents). All my other friends know that if it’s an emergency, they can call twice to reach me. We’ve gotten to a point in society where it’s always “need to be accessible all the time” and that is so rarely the case. Instagram, FB, Snapchat—those are auxiliary tools. You do NOT need those notifications on and it will constantly have you picking up your phone. 
Also, I moved all my social media apps to an iPad that has harsh screen time limits. So I have to be intentional with my scrolling, and I can only do it at home. 
All of this was really hard to adapt to at first, but after about two weeks I found myself more productive, more engaged in conversations, and LESS anxious. Just wanted to share!"

0,"Girl you are going through huge spiritual transitions!! My partner is HUGELY into spirituality and all paths of religion and they were listening to the podcast with me last week and were shocked about the things you were talking about. With the swan imagery and your newer topics of conversation, I have a feeling that in July you will have a major shift in your consciousness. Lets go Brittany!!!!!

821,"Girl I actually thought when I opened the video “omg her curly hair is so cute!” You’re too hard on yourself. Also I will say, if you happen to read this, when I was really obsessed with spirituality and reading tarot and constantly trying to better myself, that was when I was the most unhappy. When I just started working and enjoying my hobbies in my free time, I started to feel so much better. I am way happier now than I was when I was really woo-woo and obsessed with myself and happiness. I know a lot of people may contradict this, but it’s just my experience. 

Also finding fun things to do off the phone is key. I’ve been really into sewing and crafting, and it brings me SO MUCH joy. Also gardening. You can listen to a podcast or something, but it gets you to stop scrolling."

0,"I'm so happy that you're exploring the occult, spirituality and esoteric things more. I'm very into it. It's really freeing and you really feel seen. For me it has helped me alot with my mental health also meditation, crystals and yoga. This has helped me to be more intuitive and listen to my body better. Maybe it could help you too. I also have anxiety and PCOS and other health issues. So I feel you❤"
0,The Abrahamic religions are for the mass market they are a one size fits all kind of spiritualism. Individuality isn’t really encouraged and especially not exploring your personal relationship with the concept of spirituality in general.
0,HAIR IS SOOO TEA IN THIS MOTHERR
0,We NEEEED a ghost hunting investigation with you and your mom!!! IM HEREEEE FOR ITTTT! I hope you see thissss 💙✨
0,Hiiiii! Woo-woo girly clocking in. You’re on the brink of your Saturn return- a time with a lot of change. To tap into your feminine intuition I’d HIGHLY recommend journaling. If it’s overwhelming maybe just start with 1 page a day.
0,"you need to open yourself up to having a good intuition, meditation and affirmations are really helpful"
0,Does your mom have a channel?
0,"It’s funny that she immediately believed the psychic with the stomach and leg stuff, and I instantly thought this b*tch knew her face and watches her podcast! 😅"
0,My dog is going nuts to you singing about blue berry Red Bull 😂😂😂
0,"the key to intuition is that there is nothing you need to DO. You just need to be. Compared to the thinking mind that is always analyzing, trying to figure out, trying to plan. Just be in the moment and listen to what feels right in the moment. It’s harder said than done obviously but at the same time, easy. Because there really is NOTHING you have to do."
0,jojor well
0,"Hey! I admire who you are A LOT and all of the hard work you put into your content! I usually don't comment on anything or have the time to consume much media bcs I have a busy lifee (or I am too anxious LOL). However, this video called to me and I felt such a deep resonance with every single thing you talked about and it is making my heart race girl!!! I am AT FRIGGIN WORK rn typing this because I need to let you know that what you do matters. Your energy is a special one , and one that you need to protect!!! Us energetically sensitive girlies are srsly out there with you , and when you talk about these intuitive ruts , what you are experiencing spiritually - IDEK how to explain it but it just matters. It matters so much more than you prolly think. Within a world that is in the cross hairs of a volatilely uncertain future - your discussions , experiences , and your energy have grounded MY OWN. Which is honestly a friggin super power IMO. I am getting a psychic reading bcs of this video and I have this strong gut feeling that it will change a lot in my life. Love you , take care of yourself."

0,I believe in it and I don't think you're crazy.
0,No because Carrie's whole relationship with Aidan made me so mad and she runs back to Big for what? For the same mediocre relationship where he was literally giving her less than bare minimum?! He deserved so much better lol and so did carrie but also she deserved that sad relationship with Big. That episode arch made me so mad lolol
0,"you and i look alike. Especially, our eyes, x"
0,"Hey Brittney, idk if you'll see this but maybe this can help others who feel similar. I 100% felt the same way as you a few years ago, I grew up in a very stifling home and I didn't get to really know myself until I moved out and went to college. And even there it felt like I was trying to please everyone but myself.

Honestly and frankly. It took me getting to a very low place to push myself to take a look at myself and learn to like myself. Not saying you need to be in a low place, but at least getting to a point where you can look at yourself.

I love you and you bring me joy, but honestly and DEEPLY what healed me and made me trust myself was decentering men, decentering being in a relationship, and learning to genuinely love being single. Love just hanging with my friends, spending time with myself, doing little things for myself. Without the existential doom that I would be alone forever. And I think you and many MANY other woman really struggle with that. Because frankly it sucks at first and it sucks when your friends and family all seem to have someone. But yeah, to you or anyone, first step I can give is decenter those men.

Now I'm not perfect, but I've learned to love that I'm not perfect and through that I built a trust in me. Cause at the end of the day, you will die and you will die with yourself. So better to get to know yourself than to fear it. Love you and all you do!"

2,"sex and the city is THE best show. the depth and humanity of the show?!? the reality of being a woman and being a group of woman. The FASHION, the lack of fear to bring up stigmatized opinions on women, men, and being in your 20s-30s. it’s my favorite show and i’ve watched it twice and i keep having the urge to start it again I ALREADY FINISHED IT THIS YEAR"
0,Cramps could also be potassium related but I remember you saying you’re not supposed to have high potassium food due to your pcos and androgen production. I’m glad you got that ultrasound tho for the cramps bc clots in the legs are serious!

1,"GIRL I KNOW IM LATE BUT DO I HAVE A BOOK RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU!!!!
Calling the Spirits by Lisa Morton. It’s a history of seances!!
It covers SO MUCH! And it is so interesting."
0,for intuition and working on listening to yourself id highly recommend learning abt the chakras and understanding when they are out of balance. its a great base to start actually listening to your mind and body  and what they are trying to tell you. this definitely wont fix everything but understanding when for example your throat chakra is out of balance  it makes it so much easier to work on expressing your voice than it would be if you had knowledge on why you feel a certain way if that makes sense :)
1,i fell asleep while watching this and had some weird ass dreams
1,"As a tarot reader, thank you for educating yourself on the topic. People LOVE to demonize things they know nothing about."
0,55:07 fr 😭
2,"As a woo woo girly (peep my black cat ESA.): Intuition is developed through practice. Keeping a dream journal, practicing yoga, meditation, drinking some yummy teas to slow down. If you are constantly on the go you need to make time for that pause. Take care of your body, cleansing baths with salts and just saying a prayer/affirmation during helps. Deadass touch grass and touch a tree. It sounds silly but as humans we’re disconnected from nature and spending time alone outside helps. Pull some tarot for yourself after saying a prayer/affirmation of protection and keep a tarot journal. Also angel numbers will let you know if you’re on track of off. I see them less when I’m not as connected. Idk if this helps. Happy to have you in the woo woo club lol ❤"

2,"Italian here! You read the ""occhi"" in ""tarocchi"" like you would say ""Loki"" (by Marvel) with an even stronger k, and always roooollll that r <3"
0,"My love one random and very recommended thing which you probably know and have considered or tried is meditation. Meditation will bring everything back TO YOU don’t overthink it do it anywhere but when you can stop. Close your eyes. Breathe. Let things come in and out. Until you’re at a state of okay I’m doing this keep going don’t stop. The more you do it the more you will connect with yourself play some frequencies to draw you into the intent of it. Or just silence so it’s easier to not get interrupted by the outside world. This is a good tool to draw yourself in to connect to your own personal intuition. You can have an intention but you don’t HAVE to. The more you practice and do it the more you’ll fall into this safety within yourself. When you find it and feel it it’ll mean more than everything and you’ll be able to have understanding and answers within yourself and situations. It’s insane. It’s human nature. We NEED this. If nothing worst this can at least bring you back to yourself as an individual and into your consciousness outside of your body and your have to do’s or life. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, an hour. Anywhere anytime. Try it. And don’t quit. It helps."
0,Please please please watch The Carrie Diaries
0,My advice for getting more connected with your intuition is to do a ritual where you cut the ties of negativity that attach themselves to you. Cutting away these energy ties frees the spirit of a lot of weight and murkiness
0,"The  call  with your mom was so interesting , I remember the video with your mom and I LOVED IT ❤.

I have an interest for spiritualism and paranormal. Like you I can’t say that  I believe it entirely but I am really open to the idea. 

I am just a very skeptic person.😅"
0,"2:29 i feel your pain, but for me it is Tylenol pm. that sht drains my energy, my heart rate is wierd, and my mouth is dry. dont even bring up my liver. i do not recommend at all."
1,her mom kinda sounds like tree trunks from adventure time😭
2,As a Phasmophobia player I’m very much enjoying listening to Brittany’s mom.
1,"You should look into Hekate for guidance, she is the divine feminine and i think she would be AMAZING help for you"
1,Highly highly recommend reiki therapy!!!! It has helped me so much in my journey to better intuition and getting into more of my feminine side/energy!!! ✨✨✨
0,"Hi Brittany!! I’ve been a long time fan and am an intuitive tarot/palm reader!! Please please please keep going towards what feels right spiritually! It’s how I got where I am now :) if you feel the ~tingle~ of intuition and you truly identify with your spiritual self over all else, please please go with it!! Go with the flow! Continue using discernment of course, there are lots of people who aren’t the real deal, but there are far more of those who are like this lovely woman you met with!"
0,Not only did they use tarot as a card game in Italy it was also in Egypt!
0,Also hey! Christians can practice magik and tarot! The colonizers said it was unchristian. Christmas was a pagan holiday until colonization! There is nothing about worshiping anything in magik and tarot. You can use it to be more in tune with god and angels!
0,Also as a medium I HAVE to tell you this- ABSOLUTLEY do not fk around with an ouija board.
0,Tarot is different for everyone. I use it to speak with my spirit guides which I consider to be my ancestors or anyone else who feels they need to call my ahh out. I use it as messages that my spirit guides want to tell me to literally call me out. I didn’t believe in it fully for a while until it literally predicted when I went paralyzed to a T so I was like oh ok I guess this is probably real 💀
0,Read Boys of Tommen. It’s Irish.
1,ms. broski you look positively divine
0,Weekly spiritual calls w mom would be so great
1,Diva I need you to binge watch Outlander so we can talk about it. It's fucked up... but sexy scottsman and scottish history. Netflix Baybes
0,"To answer your question supreme leader, C in Italian is pronounced hard or soft depending on what vowel comes after it. If followed by i or e, it's pronounced soft, if followed by o, a, or u, it's hard. However, if followed by an H before the i or e vowel, it modifies it to be a hard sound. So you pronounced it right!"

2,"As someone who grew up Protestant (baptist) I have always wondered why we dont talk about possession as much as Catholics. We do believe in it, I just think its something we dont like to think about. I will say in the couple of times I've heard preachers speak about it they dont tend to be as ritualistic in an exorcism as Catholics tend to be. They just pray over the person and rebuke the demon in the name of Jesus and that ends it. 

I feel as if most protestants, especially Baptists, especially southern Baptists, stay away from anything occult on the off chance it will invite something in, since we just dont openly talk about possession as Catholics do. I do believe ouija boards open a portal and youre not guaranteed someone nice will pick up the phone. 

Of course this is all just my opinion on someone who grew up southern baptist"

0,"Tbh with tarot it depends on a lot of things, obviously you have to know what to give and take and how to interpret them in a way to applies to you, so yeah some people are good at interpretation and some people just arent, it’s like when you read a book and a lot of the meanings and symbolism will go over a lot of peoples heads when it’ll be very obvious to others. Idk how much I believe in divination and what not, I do believe humans can be prophetic, I myself have had several dreams (I even told people about before they happened so I couldn’t gaslight myself that I imagined it or made it up lol) come true in real life down to the last single detail, typically me meeting people I’d never met before and them being someone I met in a dream already, but this is a normal human experience aka I’m pretty sure lots of people are fully capable of it, you could also chalk it up to pattern recognition that many people’s brains are crazy good at to the point they can predict the future. With tarot I think most people are capable of doing it and doing their own reading the only issue lies with being able to interpret and apply it to your life. IMO that’s why I prefer oracle cards, I like tarot but it’s more work and it’s not that I’m unwilling, it’s just easier for me to interpret and understand Oracle cards more cuz it feels like I’m shaking one of those eight balls and asking it questions and they’re like yes no maybe, and if they really want to pmo “look within, we can’t answer ur stupid ahh question for you”. I have a lot of fun with my Oracle cards lol, they hate me they never give me answers I want 💀 so essentially interpretation is more abundantly obvious to me with Oracle cards than it is with tarot I have to put more work into interpreting it with tarot it’s not just instantly understandable and crystal clear, but I also haven’t done too many readings for others I think I’d struggle interpreting for another person than I would for myself (for obvious reasons lol)."
0,"As a Romany person (romanichal) we do not own tarot due to is origins in Italy. Traditional during the 1800 we regularly practiced playing cards to read fortunes. Later adopting tarot due to our migration through Europe into Italy/grease. 

We have closed practices and spreads they outsiders cannot use as it’s inappropriate. It’s a gift that can only be given by roma. If you see our practice you are not entitle to copy as there many other types of practices. Our practice is maternal inherited from our mother and passed to our sisters though many men it’s unusual but if they have the gift one cannot deny fate"

0,"One day when i still lived with my parents I heard my dad open the front door, lock it, walk to the kitchen, and put down his keys on the counter as he did every day. He usually comes to my room and says hi so i was waiting for him to come in, but he never did. So after a few minutes i got up to go find him and… no one was there. I immediately called him to check if he came by and had to leave, he was still at work. Called my mom to see if it was her, she was also at work. I was terrified. When i tell you i heard this CLEAR AS DAY, it was undeniable! I kept our house alarm turned on at all times when i was home from that day forward so i would know for sure if someone opened the front door. I’ve also had papers go flying off a shelf once where there was no draft, no movement, no possible explanation. I’ve never doubted the existence of “ghosts” or “spirits,” especially after the things I’ve witnessed."

0,"Okay with the Ouija board stuff, my dad, Troy, has had two personal experiences that happened when he was in his teens, so this would’ve been during the late 80s into the 90s. 

Once was when he was at a party in another town with a friend, so nobody there knew him except for the friend. They were in the kitchen getting a drink, and he hears someone from the dining room say “Is anyone here named Troy?” Needless to say he was surprised, but he went to the dining room and talked to the board for a bit, until it started doing the typical figure 8s motion until they finally said “goodbye” to it and left. 

The other actually happened to my mom, but it’s related to something that happened to my dad. My mom and my aunt used to play with an ouija board at my grandparents’ house for fun even though my grandmother absolutely hates the game. One time when they were using it, it spelled out my dad’s name, who my mom was still only dating at the time. They asked a few more questions, and then after a while it just kept spelling out “accident.” My mom, worried, called my dad’s mom to see if he was alright, but she said he wasn’t home and was out with some friends. Apparently about an hour later my dad called his mother from the hospital because he and his friend had gotten into a car accident and the car was totaled. They were both extremely lucky to get out with only some scratches and pretty bad whiplash. My grandmother said that after learning about that she got rid of the board so they couldn’t use it anymore.

Lmao sorry for the long comment, but Ouija boards are something that have always interested me considering my parents’ experiences with them!"

0,"Brittany, to get in touch with your feminine intuition, you'd benefit greatly from meditation. Have someone work with you personally to teach you to meditate, and then set yourself up a time to do it everyday. You'll notice a difference in a few weeks with consistency. Good luck"
0,"20:56 PREACH!!! So many people float through life, the victim of everything unable to take accountability for their inactions."
0,"Journaling has been probably the most helpful tool for me to improve my intuition. When I journal it’s when I’m truly paying attention to what I am feeling about a situation or feeling; and it allows me to visually lay out all my thoughts and comprehend them. This then allows me to fully understand my feelings and what my body is trying to say.
For example, if I’m involved in a romantic situation with someone and I’m beginning to feel uncomfortable or suspicious by their lack of communication. I will sit down and journal how I’m feeling and what I think it could be, and continuously ask myself questions about the situation until I really feel I’ve solidified that decision/knowledge. Then this allows me to lay out the intrusive thoughts, the past traumas it could stem from, insecurities, and/or real boundaries and needs aren’t being met. Paying attention and giving time to the feelings that go through your body- good and bad - allows a lot of knowledge to draw from and being able to tell what your body is saying. This awareness allows you to then convey it into action or planning when you feel ready!
So in the future, when you have a feeling, you can refer back to the things you already know from when you truly asked yourself these questions. Intuition doesn’t just come from a feeling. It’s the inner knowing- and how will you know what’s inside if you don’t take the time to hear it!
Hope this helps and makes sense <3"

I don't do religion anymore, but we did believe people could be possessed with demons and people did ""exorcise"" them. The difference is demon possession wasn't seen as the freaky or fantastical as it is in movies. They don't even used the term possesed. They just say a person ""has a demon in them"" and the most dramatic it gets is when someone acts like theyre having a seizure while the preacher and other members of the church stand around them and ""lay hands"" on them to run the demon out. No fancy ritualistic catholic business. But to them, people with addiction, lgbtq people, atheists, etc. are all examples of someone who has a demon in them."

0,"What really helped me tap into my intuition and really listen to my body and emotional responses to things was “the sacral response” which is what can be utilized in human design (sister to astrology) in order to gauge how your higher self and your intuition can be guiding you. 
For most, when your soul is asked a question out loud or in your head, and you imagine yourself being there living that question, your body and soul will respond through very small bodily processes. 
A great example of this would be meditating or just slowing down, laying down or sitting, closing your eyes and asking “would my soul and being benefit from me moving to _____ country?” You imagine yourself living that life, living in that country and pay very close attention to what your body does. 
A strong YES can be a deep instinctive sigh, a smile, muscle relaxation, a pulling forward or “filling up” feeling in your gut and chest (typically “filled” with hope or joy at the thought of the question) and personally I can also feel a slight buzzing around my head. 
A strong NO is most importantly a feeling of uneasiness, sometimes even nausea, a frown or upset facial expression, a sinking feeling in your body and I’ve had times where I instinctively shake my head no. 
Sometimes, you can get no answer. It’ll feel flat, it’ll feel like there is no particular way you feel about this question and that can be seen as a “let’s ask again at another time” or “not right now”. 

Using this method you gauge what your intuition may be trying to signal to you at that given time. If you get a strong no for something or a strong yes it may change if questioned again at a later time, going back to the example of moving- if you get a no, maybe it wasn’t your time. Maybe your intuition is telling you to hold off a little longer so that you can follow the correct path and meet the correct people and do the correct things. 

Everyone has an intuition that can be developed- it’s like a muscle and needs to be tuned so that you are able to understand it. Sometimes your intuition and gut feelings will tell you things that don’t align with what you may logically be thinking but at the very least you owe your higher self a try at it. 
Love you Brit!!! 37:09"

But my aunt told me that when she was in highschool her and some friends played with one. Creepy things started happening to them even after they closed the board. They all had non stop nightmares, insomnia, and a couple occasions they heard voices. So they got all together to burn the board and they said the board didn’t burn when they tried multiple times to set it on fire. But whenever the fire touched the board they could hear a scream coming from the woods. So they had to buried it and since then she always told me never to touch an Ouija board."

0,"My intuition became stronger when i established healthy habits and coping mechanisms for my mental illness. I still have depression and anxiety, but finding ways to work with it whether its medication, affirmations, self care apps like Finch, a consistent sleep schedule, changing your diet or exercise routine, taking a few minutes out of your day to be in nature- any step toward a healthier mentality gives your mind room for a stronger connection to the divine. Because your head isnt filled with negative thoughts and feelings all the time, it becomes more receptive to messages. I can notice them now because i am not constantly at war with my own mind. Also, practicing gratitude helped me. Because once I started looking for things to be grateful for and thanking the universe for what i have, i became more aware of myself and my surroundings, and that helps grow my perception and therefore my intuition."

0,"37:12 omg GIRL i can already think of like 4 things. i wish we could still do video replies on youtube ugh. maybe ill like make a video and post it to tiktok or something. this is gonna be such an abbreviated version and also every practitioner is different. 
1. STOP USING THC FOR THE LOVE OF THE GODDESS give it UP mary. please. from a clinical standpoint ur dopamine receptiors are not at baseline & its robbing you of your natural intuition. it exacerbates anxiety & paranoia in alot of ppl. many ppl do rituals high or under the influence and it can enhance the experience but you have to have intentions & be mindful like ur goin on a trip. i wouldnt recommend for you. 

2. you can make moon water!! look up the significance of the new vs full moon and the sign its in to make sure it aligns with those intentions.  new moon=endings & beginnings. aka, the planning stage. full moon=culmination point, full fertile rich energetic peak. both great for reflecting. make sure its sterile if you wanna drink it, or, i like to put a little in my shampoo/conditioner/bodywash and u'll get a lil power boost of those intentions each time u bathe.

okay SO, 3. you're gonna learn how to make a symbol, aka, a sigil. it can be an anagram, an abstract thing, but its gotta represent your intention. your gonna wanna carve that on a candle. ur gonna make it a white candle. 

3.1. pop some a lil amethyst under that baby and (optional, a ring also. u can wear the ring after all this bc its infused w the intention of the ritual) if u wanna go extra, id recommend clear quartz. and then if u wanna go extra extra, maybe some carnelian, a lil citrine, maybe some tourneline. (if you wanna go tarot about it all, learn about the 9 of pentacles and the high priestess and the empress & the moon, print those cards out, put at base of candle w crystals)
3.2. Light that shit up on the full or new moon, or a monday. monday=lunes=lunar=divine feminine intuition. meditate with the candle for awhile. journal about ur intentions and stuff. 
3.3. Write ur intention like idk ""female intuition"" or whatever 3 times on the front & ur sigil on the back. fold 3 times toward you. rotate clockwise after each fold. fold toward=bring energy in. put ur sigil on the back. burn that shit with the flame. 
3.4 Leave a little pomegranate or ur fav fresh juicy fruit in front of it for a night with ya crystals. eat the rest. take a shower afterwards.
3.5. after that night, keep that amethyst in ur purse/bra/under ur pillow. sleep with it. draw that sigil on ur wrist or keep a lil drawing of it in ur wallet. 
4. pop off. this was a speedrun hope it helps. bless ur sweet soul."

0,I live how she mentions about standing up for what you believe in by protesting and doing it SAFELY which is a very important factor when it comes to change. Thank you for bringing this up Brittany I really appreciate that! ❤
0,her saying “what are they tryna tell us girl” and her moms little giggle 😭 so cute ❤
1,"The virtue signaling in the comments is so fucking tired.  Personally, I don't care who you are — famous or not. It is not anyone's individual responsibility to be an advocate for anything or to speak on it publicly.

If someone doesn’t speak on something publicly, you have no idea how they feel privately, what they might be doing behind the scenes, or what they actually believe — and you're not entitled to their opinion, no matter who they are or what else they share on the internet."
0,"24:07 dude I've never heard anybody else voice that out loud before, and it's crazy because it's exactly how I describe the feeling, Brittany I love you, you always find a way to voice my feelings, something I'll never forget is when you said that you leave claw marks on the things that you've loved because that's so me, you literally get me like nobody else does"
0,Did not even know she was being cancelled on TikTok until I read these comments
0,"to connect your intuition i always practice writing down affirmations along the lines of ""i open my heart to..."" ""i open my mind to..."" ""i attract all positive connections into my life"" and then to release negativity i write ""i release my negativity/obsessive thoughts/anxious delusions"" and also ground yourself by meditating to frequencies (there are sm on spotify/youtube) and just open your mind and heart to what your intuition is trying to tell you. but by releasing those things / speaking positive things into existence, it makes your mind less cluttered with anxiety / obsessive thoughts making room for that intuition <333 im also an ex christian (catholic specifically) and now i read tarot and i completely agree i feel way more seen in spirituality way more than i ever was with religion. nothing is ever a coincidence :) hope this helps!!!"
0,I will say that im protestant and my church has held exorcisms
0,"I’m so late but you have to go to Achill next time you are in Ireland. We can have a 🌲💨 on the beach 😂 

Connecting with nature is the answer. Think Sleep Token “Don’t you bathe in rivers”. Swim in the Atlantic Ocean. The beach at Keel is good craic. One of the best surfing spots in Ireland/EU. Hot days there’s barely any waves, but then you can just float. I have my pool noodle down with me and just being in the sea is great. Feel euphoric walking up the beach. Do recommend a wetsuit though 😂🇮🇪"
0,Absolutely wrong about tarot not supposed to be read by yourself. Developing and harnessing your intuition starts somewhere
0,"ooh i love the tarot topic, i want to hear moreee"
0,I absolutely adore when you talk about mystical magical spiritual things recording about the intuition it's like a muscle you have to exercise it and then you will start to trust it more and more you can start and your everyday life
0,"Lady Brittany Broski,

1,"everyone whos giving her shit ‘not talking about what’s going on’ aren’t giving other influencers and celebrities the same energy. even though she is and has a platform for to do so, it baffles me that people think it is a huge responsibility on influencers to do so"
0,"me and my two friends played the ouija board very often and one time we got a demon named “baba” as we all 3 held on our hands on the planchet it just kept spelling “baba baba baba baba baba” which you arent supposed to let happen and we freaked out and let our hands off and freaked out running away. we believe we let whatever it was out of the board because we did not say goodbye. that whole summer we were haunted. walking around the neighborhood we would see black figures running past us, the trailer we did the board in we stayed at a lot and there would be banging on the walls the sink would turn on without the handle being pulled every single cabinet door opened creaking on the front porch and i know it sounds like maybe it was a person. no. it wasnt i dont know what it was but it was not a human it was not a person. it was terrifying and we were like 15.  we continued to use the board and talked to someone else who would try to warn us and protect us about this entity we let out. it was insane."
0,"The second show is good to me, idk why everyone else hates it so much but please watch it all to the end ❤ of sex and the city"
0,girl you have A LOT of Samantha in you!!!!!! you're the best
0,"i just love when you bring on your mom onto any type of media you make, she truly sounds like an angel of a person and at the same time, very insane grandma vibes. love her, we need more mama broski stories and context."
0,"hey! so you mentioned wanting to get your home cleansed and protected, which is great! i will say that the use of white sage is something that's been a point of contingency and debate for as long as i've been researching spiritualism and religion across cultures, mostly because of cultural appropriation concerns. if your interested in other alternatives, sandalwood and frankincense are both really popular components used for making incense, and they both are known for their cleansing properties. i completely understand your fear, though, and having someone else come out to your place and cleanse it for you is so valid"
0,34:15 PLEASE GET THAT CHECKED. I have spondylolistesis and trust me it’s not fun
0,"To me, Tarot is just a tool to help you navigate through problems. It helps you talk to yourself or makes the person you're reading for think about something in a way they never would have done on their own. I love Tarot sm <3"
0,"When I was in my early teens my parents (pre divorce), brother and I moved into a new house. I don’t remember much except that it felt odd, though I put it down to anxiety about the new area, school, and home.

There was a conservatory at the back, which we used as a living/dining room. The dining table sat against the left wall, just in front of the door (without blocking it), and the sofa was slightly to the right of the table, up against the back wall. From the sofa, you could see the table, the hallway towards the front door, and the kitchen in your peripheral vision.

Now and then, my cat would sit on me and react towards the table or door. I assumed she was watching a fly and didn’t think much of it. But not long after, I started noticing a vague, shadowy figure in the corner of my eye, always in the same spot. I assumed it was just a lack of sleep. Over time, it became more noticeable, and my cat reacted every time. Eventually, I realised it felt like a small dog, walking from under the dining table, through the old back door, and towards the front door. It didn’t feel threatening, just stuck in a loop, and would vanish once it reached the end of thehall.

I never mentioned it at the time. My younger brother was very easily frightened, and I didn’t want to scare him. My mum is quite spiritual, and I worried she’d try to “remove” it because of my brother, which might make things worse. The dog didn’t seem harmful, and even my cat seemed unbothered.

After the divorce, while staying at my dad’s one weekend, I told him about it while we were watching a scary film. He said he’d seen the exact same thing and had the same feeling about it. We agreed not to tell anyone. But after that conversation, I never saw the dog again. It was like acknowledging him made him move on. I told my dad, and we eventually shared the story with my mum and brother. Neither of them had seen or felt anything, despite my Mum being the most ""spiritual"" of us.

Later, my mum casually asked our neighbour about the previous tenant, no hints or leading questions. He said it had been an elderly man who’d lived there with his dog. His wife had passed away, and he eventually moved out due to age, but the dog had died before he left. He didn’t say whether the dog died in the house, but that it had been a small terrier type dog, just like the one my dad and I had both sensed.

This is my first time sharing this story, I feel slightly sad that I never saw him again, but I hope he found his owners wherever they ended up."
0,just got convinced to watch sex and the city
0,Just broke it off from an almost 5 year relationship and when I say MAN-CHILD I mean it like omg. Always love your videos and they always make me laugh💟
1,We need a full episode with Mama Broski asap!
0,Brittany PLEASE go on a ghost hunt with your mom!!!
0,"Woo woo bitch here 🤗 

It’s interesting how you feel disconnected from female intuition and you are experiencing physical sickness in your gut. The “trust your gut” thing is so real. 

Having something presented to you, and your gut gives an “uh huh”- it can be interpreted as excitement and a resounding yes. If your gut gives a “nuh uh”- it can be interpreted as anxiety and an appropriate time to say no. Nervousness is okay regardless! Brittany’s gut gives ✨rot and fail✨ 🤪😭

As someone who also has their battles with chronic illnesses and organ failure, your spiritual awakening and desire to connect to source through yourself truly resonates. Keep exploring them crystals n tarot gurrrr !!"
0,You look great queen 🖤
0,As someone whose favorite show of all time has been SATC for 15 years… welcome 10:25
0,"I’m a licensed therapist, and when you were talking about losing your intuition and asking for tips, I had some thoughts. I was thinking that more than likely you haven’t lost your intuition or really need others opinions to guide you, it’s probably related to the elevated anxiety you’ve been talking about experiencing. Is your anxiety the one telling you you can’t trust your intuition? If that’s the case, I’d recommend looking into Socratic questioning. It takes you through questions you can ask yourself when you have these negative automatic thoughts to help you challenge them and take their power away. This is a big leap based off the tiny bit you said about it, but it was the first thing that came to mind. For example, if you have little to no evidence to support your thought that you can’t trust your own intuition, it no longer holds any merit or control. I hope this is helpful! If not, ignore me😂"
1,if i get the megan ad one more time 🥲
0,"hey babes so the best way for increasing intuition (specifically your feminine intuition) is to just call upon it more often. Sure you can carry crystal with you (amethyst, Lapis Lazuli, Moonstone and Fluorite are great for intuition in a a small black pouch with lavender, mugwort and peppermint) but journal your experiences where you have used your intuition the best. Journal times when you have trusted your intuition and then the outcome of trusting it."
0,51:35 NOT A MEGHAN AD PLAYING RIGHT AFTER 😭
0,"your body and mind know the difference between truth/intuition and anxiety/lies! from one anxious bitch to another, practice with truths you know and are rooted in. tell yourself the opposite of that truth and then remind yourself of what you know is real, you can feel the difference. sit in the quiet, listen and find where your messages come from (music, nature, journaling, etc.) and know that it takes time to build self trust just like with anyone else. you are POWERFUL AND WE BELIEVE IN U SUPREME LEADER"

0,i am a developing woo woo bitch and a recovering people pleaser and i really resonated with your feelings of only ever taking direction from those around you and not knowing what to do on my own and just trust myself. my relationship with spirituality keeps growing and this has me convinced i should go get a psychic reading. I have done other kinds of readings like aura soma (so interesting) and i have the same response of when they hit home i immediately cry. that whole section of the video made me want to sit with you and talk about energy and something bigger with you for hours!

0,"Loved ones don't need a portal to contact you, but they might come when you're doing the ouija board because you are more open to encountering them in that moment. Darker spirits might need the ""portal"" opened however, because they require your permission to access you. Playing with the ouija board gives them permission."

0,"Psychic medium here, I can say that I’m the biggest advocate for this ability. Meaning, I always am quick to explain exactly how it works and how I understand those who don’t believe it. If I didn’t have the ability myself, I’m not sure if believe it either. With everything I’ve experienced growing up, not understanding that things were attracted/attached to me BECAUSE of my ability was difficult. I was seeing and experiencing things, telling those around me, and no one believed me. Even though I gave my mom a reading on her father (he was born in 1912, died in the 70’s when she was in 2nd grade. I thought the grandpa I had growing up was my blood grandpa until this day). I didn’t understand what was happening but had the urgency to tell her these random things. All of that to say, psychics are real, this ability is real and it’s overwhelming at times. My purpose is to share this ability with everyone and genuinely explain how the other side works with respect to all religions. I knew my whole life I wanted to help people, but I didn’t know how. No 9-5 was fulfilling…it was draining. I’m a spiritual advisor/psychic medium and offer private readings. I’ve never been happier, more passionate, and more spiritually intuned than I am right now and will continue to be. I enjoy sharing my gift and serving my purpose here on earth…which is to help souls connect with past loved ones to ensure grief doesn’t redirect their life path and steer them away from it, especially when people pass tragically. With lack of answers/clarity in life after death, it instills negativity/fear into those who lose those closest to them. My purpose is to connect and share specific messages, as well as connecting with the individual and explaining their life path and past/present/future things that are arise. Much like she explained, even into finances, love life, health, family, person direction, all of it. I use/have all the “Clairs” we call it which means my readings are lengthy and intense. I connect so immensely that once it starts, things don’t stop flowing. I wouldn’t want to experience life without this ability but it does get overwhelming. I enjoy listening to people’s experiences with psychics, especially those who understand the ability. 🤍"

0,"there’s no way Brittany will ever see this but I literally had a nightmare about some killer named Liam except the whole killer thing would pass from person to person, so after the first killer killed their target, then another person would become the killer, dressing in the same clothes and sharing the name Liam, and I kid you not Brittany was eventually a victim, EXCEPT she somehow managed to not be killed without even realising. She was oblivious and hilarious. I remember the killer tried to kill her by throwing knives while she was on her daily walk or something, but she bent over to pick something up JUST at the right time, dodging them. And she kept slipping through the killers fingers with GRACE and COMEDY. My nightmare became a dream when she popped up LMAO"

0,"MEDITATE!! I don't know how likely you are to see this, but I don't feel like tapping into your intuition is a quick fix. What works for me is meditation as a habit. The more you just sit with yourself without any outside influence just sitting with your thoughts intentionally. You have no voice to listen to but your own. And when you're out ""in the wild"" you will learn to recognize your own voice amidst all the noise."

0,"Hi Brittany!! Protestantism might not have exorcisms because it is a ceremonial/ritual practice. Catholicism is rooted in ceremony and ritual, while Protestantism began as a rejection of ceremonialism, calling for a more personal and modest practice of christianity. It would explain why they still have basic “spirit be gone” prayers, but not the big latin-reading, ritual exorcisms. Your mom might have already followed up with you on this, but if you want to know more I recommend learning about the Protestant reformation in 16th century Europe, and things like the great iconoclasm."

0,"There ARE exorcisms in the protestant faith. We don’t call it exorcisms though- we usually call it deliverance from spiritual oppression / demons.  

I go to a Non denominational Christian Church here in LA- and I’ve seen people be set free from demonic oppression.  

Jesus casts out demons when he was on Earth.  there’s multiple spots in the Bible but read Matthew 8:28-34"

2,As a pagan/druid I recommend doing yoga or meditation to clear your mind; burn some insence and cleanse your space and yourself
0,"37:26 I dabble in things like this and from what I know there’s unfortunately not a simple solution to evolving your intuition. You have to train it like a muscle and that involves trusting your gut/ inner monologue on how you feel about something. Trust that you body and mind are reacting a certain way for a reason. There are books out there that can explain it better, so I’d recommend reading that"
0,"I’m a Catholic convert from non denominational Protestantism. Protestants definitely also believe in people getting possessed, I think Protestants believe more in praying “from the heart” and just making up your own prayers vs the more Catholic tradition of reciting already written prayers as well as just praying whatever you want. So when Protestants do “exorcisms” they tend to just make up their own prayers along the way vs the Catholics having a set “rite of exorcism” that they’ve followed for hundreds of years"

0,"about the leg spasms, i get those too like muscle twitching. i used to get them sporadically like in random places all day, back legs arms and face. i went to a neurologist abt it and had bloodwork done, x-rays, and they told me i was all clear and that they see it commonly in young people with lots of stress and anxiety, they call it BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). this makes sense bc it happened after a traumatic event in my life gave me intense anxiety. i got on an anxiety medication and worked on my mental health and the twitching/spasms decreased dramatically, they only ramp up when i get really anxious or stressed or if im starting to get sick. the way our bodies react to different factors is crazy!"
0,"I've been getting more into spirituality in a woo woo kind of way and for clarity or connecting with your intuition I recommend being quiet with yourself in a meditation for at least 10 minutes a day. Light a candle, sit cross legged on a mat and close your eyes. Try to empty your mind and not think at all about anything, just focusing on your breath. It can help calm your nervous system but also allow your brain the deep rest it needs to process life. Best of luck to you and I love your videos 🩷"

0,INTUITION HELP- read “the gift of fear” by Gavin de Becker!!!!!
0,"Brittany, this is coming from a non-judgmental place. I’m just an another girl in her mid twenties who really enjoys your content cause I think it’s funny and relatable. I preface this to emphasize I have no parasocial intent or ulterior agenda. I was in the same place you were for a minute. I thought, “I definitely believe in God, there’s definitely more out there, but frankly the people in this church and around me suck. These two concepts cannot coincide”. My childhood was pretty rocky, and for the longest time I thought, if there’s is a God, and it is Jesus, He is not listening to me and that makes him inherently cruel. Because I dont know what’s worst, a God who punishes, or one who is apathetic to my suffering. My spiritual exploration  looked a little different, im a Latina in a STEM field, so culturally it was insanely taboo to not even pretend to believe, and in my career, it was pretty normal to be agnostic or clinical about these matters. So I decided to appreciate religion and spirituality through an anthropological lense. And I figured out I was still worshiping and looking to cling on to something. It was my job, or my career, or my self image. I tried philosophy books like Diogenes, Plato, Nietzche and I still felt so empty and lost. I felt too much pride too, to say that. So I blamed myself. It was because I wasn’t dedicated enough, committed, driven, self sufficient etc. Culturally too, all I ever knew was “machismo”, and of course, people will try to rationalize it with religion. That, coupled with my inherently male dominated career had already planted in my mind that I did not look like a “woman of God” who surrendered her career to homemake and submit to the iron will of her husband. So out of desperation and because it was the only comfort I could remember feeling as a child, I prayed. And I decided to check delve into Bible on my own, because why not at this point? And idk. I went on this tangent you might not even see because I see myself in you (again! I swear I’m not parasocial) and I wish someone would’ve told me it’s okay. It’s okay if you’ve changed your mind. It’s okay that you find Comfort in God and the most popular religion in the world, some things are popular for a reason. More personally, it’s not a “colonizer religion”, everyone everywhere uses good ideals and motives to justify evil things. I hope I’m not projecting too much onto you, though inevitably I am. I say this with zero intention of saying this like an insincere jab, I really will pray for you tonight. I hope you find the fulfillment and love you search for. I’ve only been able to find it in one place. Rooting for you, not only as a fellow woman, but because I think your sincerity is admirable, and through the tid bits you share about your life, you seem like an empathetic person, and I think think the content you put out is a net positive. <3"

0,"(Baby witch here) I'm also working on honing my intuition. Biggest thing is giving yourself the time to slow down and listen to your deeper self. Think back to those moments where you were still and instantly like ""this is how this is gonna happen, etc"" and it came true? Think of how that felt as opposed to other thoughts and emotions. Work on noticing that and giving that your thought and intention. When you point your intention at something that is majik in essence."

0,Perfect timing for a video like this. I love your mom. I would LOVE to hear more about things she knows. The stuff about residual energies make so so much sense. I’ve been experiencing them a lot lately and wow the idea of the energy just getting trapped makes sooo much sense. My body got shivers
1,Something I've realized abt Brittany is she wants to be loved like a woman loves. She wants a man to treat her like two women would each other and GOD THAT'S SO REAL. CAN MEN JUST LOVE THE WAY WOMEN DO?
0,Silver is protection against the Fae I always carry atleast some silver with me! Also make a st.Bridget’s cross out of reed it’s best to make it in spring during imbolc but you can make it anytime just try for spring next year and burn it at the end of the year. Oh also hang it above your door way. This is an Irish tradition btw
0,Meditation. That’s the answer for connecting with your intuition. Truly it’s the only answer
1,The secret of the history of tarot is that there’s no definite yes or no answer even with the symbolism
1,This is crazy I just researched the history of the ouijia boards and a bunch of people were making them at the same time until they all gave the rights to one guy. For some reason but in one year there’s so many different people making different variations!
1,"Also can we talk about the fact that the Vatican and the English were evil asf. Like they started the transatlantic slave trade, they started and funded residential schools in America, they paid off pedophiles and kept them in areas so they could repeat offend, also the Magdalene laundries in Ireland, not to forget to mention the POTATO FAMINE. Which my ancestors left Ireland because of! There’s so much more but man they’re evil and they pretend to be saints! Just like how their bible says the devil will appear it’s spooky!"
0,I got into tarot because my mom had an old book still from when she tried years before. I got obsessed with it and she made me prove to her that I’d keep interest because we were poor and the decks were 20$ then. I learned most of the cards at like 8 years old. Then at 11 I found a Celtic pagan book now I’m proudly Irish pagan. I was raised American/Irish Catholic. So I totally understand it being the opposite of how you were raised. Just wait until you denounce the church and realize how much you do everyday is because of the church lmao. You need to look into your ethnicity and study their pagan roots! Nothing makes me feel more seen! It’s so damn interesting too!
0,I love tarot but a lot of them are scam artist!
0,LET ME TELL YOU when a psychic is real! They’re reallllll! I’ve only met one actual psychic out of many readings! my sister was 18 didn’t meet her boyfriend yet and the psychic read her for filth everyone came out crying because she called out all of their traumas and talked to their dead family members. Anyway she snuck in a little hint that my sister would be a great mom. This was unfathomable and we were all like yeah right lady ahah not even a year later my sister is in our living room crying to my parents that she’s pregnant with my niece. She’s almost 30 now. The psychic disappeared soon after never seen her again. She was so good my mom still talks about that one lady. Lol

0,1:01:09 As someone who grew up in an Assemblies of God church — there are CERTAINLY exorcisms in Protestant churches. They’re just in the more “charismatic” circles. I cannot tell you how many services/stories I’ve seen and heard of people convulsing on the floor from “demons being cast out” of them.
0,"As far as the female intuition (42/f) i got super into ""woo-woo"" stuff during quarantine and tried to find the thing i connected with most, and i fell in love with the history of astrology/astronomy and the connection and why certain signs have specific characteristics. All the way back to Tree of Life Kabbalah stuff. Its super easy to deep dive and helps me makes sense of other ""woo-woo"" things, because its all connected, even Tarot! I also used to subscribe to this monthly witchy box called Goddess Provisions, it varies the type of spiritual stuff to help you figure out what you like."

1,Please keep telling us your detailed opinions on sex and the city!
1,I recommend having a dream journal by your bedside! It helps me connect to the in between place! You might find it helps with imagination and creativity. I meditate on the daily (like 10 min grounding). I focus on my chakras specifically. After 6 months I could see (in my minds eye) the colors of my energy flowing in my arms and stomach. Hope this helps with your health!
3,In my psychopharmacology class we learned that hallucinogens can trigger the onset of underlying + undetected psychotic disorders so if anyone has a family history of psychosis pls be careful with things even as simple as cannabis!
1,"Woo woo girlie here. I have been training in reiki and my first lesson was to imagine a traffic light right below my rib cage. This is to allow you to learn how to interpret your sensations to your surrounding life. Practice by telling yourself *my name is Brittney* then notice the feeling you get inside as you are telling the truth. This should resonate with the color green. Then tell yourself a lie *my name is Josh* and here you should connect that feeling of a lie to the color red. And anything that feels “off” like *there is no one on the road so it’s okay to speed* should resonate with the color yellow. The more you practice, the better you can understand things that are energetically true, false, or to proceed with caution."
2,Brittany I BEG please film ghost videos with your mom

0,"you asked for a woo woo girl and here i am lmaooo. i read tarot, do astrology and practice witchcraft in my own lil way. with intuition, its literally like a muscle. you have to practice/train it and most importantly TRUST IT! i know you know what i mean when i say ""that knowing"". trust that, and try your hardest to not intellectualize it (which as a fellow eternal student and neurospicy person i know is so hard lol).  youre gonna feel woowoo and silly when you start, and prob laugh at yourself a bit but not only is that normal, its healthy (just like questioning any knowledge or new practice is healthy). also.... there is no wrong way to practice and no wrong way to do things, as long as its not a closed practice like voodoo/hoodoo, native american plants, etc. im so here for your spiritual journey in whatever way it forms! <3 so fun to see and i dont think you're alone in ""waking up"" so to speak. a lot of the world is coming to the realization of what they've been indoctrinated into / taught how to think. keep exploring and learning girl, the spiritual realm changed my life (in the most non spiritual psychosis way possible lmfaooo)"

0,We let the kids choose where they wanted to go/live & spend holidays wth. We were always happy about their choice. Divorced couples should try this. Gives the kid control of their life. If a kid lawyer was with Brittney then they DEF butt heads to that point. Glad its not remembered 😅
0,"Brittany, I have been reading this book “Beyond Anxiety” by Martha Beck that is BREAKING MY BRAIN in the best way and touches on the anxious and spiritual and intuitive and a lot of the things you mention. As I was reading it (before listening to this) I thought “I need to tell Brittany Broski about this” which is absolutely unhinged but simply my truth 😂
I’ve never commented on a YT vid before but felt compelled and I’m hoping if the universe feels it should, that this will make its way to you."
0,"37:10 All you need to connect with your spirit is intention, hold onto things that resonate with you, and turn off that merry-go-round of chaos in your brain that makes you overthink (easier said than done, ik.) 

For me, amethyst is a very powerful stone when it comes intuition, and spiritual connection. Also, getting out into nature as much as I possibly can. I try noticing patterns, unusual things, or things that stick out to me in a day no matter how insignificant they may seem. Whether it be a number I see often, an unusual animal I come across, a color I resonate with, a line of a song, etc. I research the spiritual meaning of said thing (across different faiths and belief systems) and see how it applies to what I've been feeling,  what I should be vigilant of, and/or what I should look forward to.

There's no one right way, this is just what has worked for me and made me feel much more present, in-tuned, and at peace."

0,"Witch here! The biggest (and most annoying) tip is to be SILENT. pause. Be with yourself. Turn everything off and be alone. You have to give yourself the space to truly listen to your intuition. That’s all it is, listening. Also journaling helps!!"
0,"YOU DO NOT SOUND INSANE AT ALL. Im all about the woo woo and magical essence of the universe. Two books that really changed my life are Don’t Believe Everything You Think by Joseph Nguyen and The Inner Work by Matthew Micheletti & Ashley Cottrell. The first one helped me so much with my anxiety, like it actually changed how I see my thoughts. And The Inner Work was such an eye-opening read that really helped me understand myself on a deeper level. Highly recommend both if you’re on a healing or self-growth spiritual journey. ❤❤❤❤"
0,"Intuition tip! Start with something small. For me it was going to the grocery store and standing in front of the fresh herbs and asking myself “do I want cilantro or basil?” And feeling the answer in my body. Getting familiar with that feeling, and slowly building the “muscle” over time."

0,non denominational raised christian woo woo gorl here; unfortunately I don't have the details of it as 1. it was my mom who experienced it and 2. my mother is dead BUT she told me many times about how when she was a little girl at a christian camp up in the rockies she went to every year with her family her father (who was a pastor) and some other camp counselors had to perform an exorcism on a little boy who was possessed during a campfire worship session one night. like he was speaking with an unnaturally deep voice and it was real freaky. now im mad I didn't ask for more details on how they actually helped the kid/exorcised the demon ? is that the right term? but anyways yeah.   I know my mom said there was a lot of praying and shouting and everyone was of course terrified but yeah. when she used to tell me I was more interested in what the kid was doing so LOL

0,Brittany some of us watch you on our lunch breaks please don’t look up Lama spit 💀😭
0,"37:20 I hope Brittany sees this because I have actual advice!! as someone who has recently started listening to her intuition more, its something that YOU have to hear for yourself. Theres a voice inside you at all times telling you what your soul wants. And theres a lot of noise drowning it out(social media, parents, friends, work, etc). The only way to make that intuitive voice louder is to quiet your mind and that noise. Spend a couple  hours in the morning just by yourself, without any devices or people or plans in place. Then, every morning, ask yourself what would feel good to do right now. And dont do anything until it feels right. Until your own soul goes ""yesss that sounds great"", after you sort through the noise. Then, youll know what that voice sounds like and it will get louder around you when that noise tries to drown it out in every day life. Slowly, youll learn to trust that voice because it is ALWAYS steering you toward the best version of you. It always wants to protect you and for you to feel safe. And then its just a matter of listening to that voice when you feel called to. Good luck! I hope this helps and that you(or anyone else who needs it) see this! ❤"

1,“The evil microplastics” sent me 😭
0,"I have struggled with my intuition or more so knowing what I, MYSELF truly want for my life too for awhile now. I have been going to therapy for coming up on a year. A lot of your intuition is truly understanding (and without sounding cheesy sorry) what YOU want to embody. Understanding what does and doesn’t serve you in BECOMING that embodiment. 
My therapist had me do this worksheet where it talks about viewing what you want to be as the actions you do, not as some sort of benchmark. Like “once I help c amount of people I’ll be a good person” what REALLY counts is that effort. Is that self awareness. Then you can truly feel yourself shift in what you feel is right in your life. It takes a lot of refinement, I’m still working on it myself"
0,brittany i NEED you to watch love island and cover it every week like PLSSS
0,"I loved getting to hear your thoughts when you got the reading done! Although spiritual beliefs between humans can differ, I think it’s cool that no matter what beliefs people have, a beautiful crossover is that feeling of like what you said an “aura” lots of different people have different names for it but the definition is always very similar if not the same and it’s that unspoken connection and feeling to the spirit!"
1,"37:17 What helps me alot for my intuition was not speaking it out loud, idk if thats just bc im crazy and think speaking it causes it to change but i noticed it does help me get more accurate bc im not so scared of being wrong anymore since no one knows im cucucrazy for saying something random lmao it did help me connect more to myself on being more focused on what im thinking will happen and how accurate i am when it does 🥸 i use to have more crazy accurate dreams that helps me predict or just get a hunch on wtf i or someone around me was stressing about. share the wealth but dont promote the wealth?  whatever the fuck that means"
1,"protestants definitely believe in being demon possessed, it’s just that protestants believe the power has been bestowed to any believer to get rid of demons and not just a priest with holy water. it’s called deliverance"
0,"Hello darliinnnnnn- on the subject of female intuition, which I personally have had to reconnect with FOR A HELLA LONG TIME LIKE UNFAIR WTF, anyways, the biggest thing I’ve learned… and it sounds sooo corny, is disconnecting from extraneous bullshit. I have to force myself off my phone. I genuinely had to go through like withdrawal symptoms of TikTok like???? I think this age where we have everything at the tip of our fingers all the time coupled with the need to ‘be available all the time,’ is the NUMBER ONE STIFFLER of intuition. Like how can we expect to follow how we feel when we’re watching numbskulls online tell us how we should feel, and if we don’t, we’re wrong? It’s neurotic and dystopian. Not to say that we shouldn’t educate ourselves, but maybe rather becoming more intentional about the ways we do. I’m rambling now, but yeah, get off your phone cause even passively hearing bullshit is still hearing bullshit. And grab ur boobs more. It’s comforting and also when my intuition lies."
0,"Brittany, I’m into spirituality too and also have been struggling with my intuition, and first, I think daily affirmations of saying “I trust myself” have slowly made me regain trust in myself (for me, this one can take time, like a few months honestly). But also, a huge method that works for me is that intuition is usually the calm, firm voice in your head that repeats itself once, while anxiety is frantic, usually the second voice to speak, and feels the need to repeat itself a million times. I hope this is helpful, and I hope you feel in touch with your intuition once again ♥️"
1,"As a Protestant, I have seen exorcisms. It’s just called deliverance."

0,"Not important at all but need to chime in about the SATC Miranda Steve thing, it isn’t highly regulated during custody who can be around a child or for how long if there is joint legal custody, that’s the point of joint legal custody you don’t have to get permission on minor parenting decisions with the shared child from the other parent. Each case is different and different by state but monitoring who kids are around isn’t just a standard rule when people are separating/divorcing or creating formal custody agreements"
0,37:30 I don’t know if this is “woo woo” but making art that NO ONE SEES is the only thing that will reconnect me with myself. I need to do something tangible and physical and really wrangle with what I personally want the outcome to be. Making a painting and just focusing on what I like or don’t like about it with 0 regard for anyone else is so uniquely freeing and grounding at the same time. It’s a reminder that I have a perspective and opinions that are worthy of attention.

0,"59:52 to answer Brittany’s question, i’ve been a Christian all my life and i also have an interest in the spiritual realm so here’s my answer to that question. 1.) one cannot be possessed by a demon or evil spirit if they gained salvation (meaning you believe Jesus is the Messiah, He died for your sins. God is the creator of the universe. and you’ve surrendered your life to Him.) 2.) Jesus while walking the earth was the only man that could cast demons out of people. (Mark 16:9-10 tells us Jesus casted out seven demons from Mary Magdalene. Luke 11:14-26 is another example of Jesus casting out demons.) 3.) when Jesus rose from the dead he gave his disciples the able to cast out demons but ONLY his disciples and no one else because He gave us the ultimate gift of salvation and having a direct connection with the Father. (Luke 9:1-2)"
0,You need to read the women who run with wolves in regards to connecting to your female intuition!!!
0,"The way I have always interpreted tarot, is that it is a conduit for us to interpret our lives. I believe that external forces can help guide the cards that come out, but for the most part I think our lil brains just need some imagery and guidance to help us understand what we got going on!"

0,"Just want to say “And Just Like That” is NOT good, however it’s a must watch 🤣"
0,"i don’t know everything but I do know that a core in Protestant belief is that you don’t need anyone else to access God. So, you wouldn’t consider a priest when experiencing spiritual warfare and/or a demon possession. protestants essentially would “pray it away” themselves or with a group but we believe you don’t need the “extra” you could just ask God to remove it. Not saying that’s true for every denomination and their specific differences regarding interpretation of the bible BUT mostly that’s a core belief: that you don’t need anything or anyone extra to access God/ the spiritual realm. So a priest to exercise your demons? Unnecessary to someone who is maybe Baptist."
0,"I went to a one year boarding school when I was 16. In my room was a mirror on the wall. One day I took it down to use it in another light and found a ouija board painted on the back of it.

It's one of the chill ones."

0,"Me and my friends used an Oujia board in high school and I have never used one since. It was my ex-girlfriend, me and my best friend and we did a session in a park. A spirit was talking with us, and claimed that is was a messager of aphrodite. The second we started talking to this spirit, the energy in the air changed. It almost felt as if someone was sitting across from us and had their hands on top of ours. Things started to feel weird, so we closed it out. My girlfriend and I broke up not that long after that session lol
We believe that a spirit had taken what we were looking for in the reading and intended to do some fuck shit to us for real."

0,"Woowoo psychic healer here! To connect with your intuition more i recommend meditation, paying attention to your dreams, and grounding yourself by spending time in nature. Certain crystals like Amethyst and Lápiz Lazuli and ofc practicing tarot :)"
0,"I don’t usually comment, but I love the pod! I’m a Christian and a former bruja. Honestly, to each their own as long as people are respectful of others beliefs. But I will say this knowledge is key. Don’t support anyone or anything without doing your own deep research. A lot of New Age practitioners prey on vulnerable women whether you’re going through a bad relationship, depression, or just feeling lost. We’ll never know everything, but staying informed and discerning is so important. Stay safe and take care"
0,"She said, ""You got a Nonna there, for sure 😇."""
0,"Intuition is one of many gifts we have as women and when we feel disconnected it can be very discouraging. 
But just like anything in this life, it ebbs and flows, wades and wains. 
I find that you don’t need anything external really, candles can help focus the energy but intuition is deeply “visceral” so to speak.
I find quitting the noise around me both literally and spiritually helps bring clarity.
Being conscious of all the excessive stimulation we are all too addicted to, it pollutes the ability to “tap in” to ourselves.
Taking a moment to sit with an inquiry before I bring it to others helps encourage an inner voice. Council from those we value is always important and helps carry our burdens but it’s also important who we share things with/why.
Placing a hand on my literal gut when I reflect on something helps too.. lol 
The phrase “trust your gut” has a lot of wisdom.
Hope this helps!"
0,"woo woo bitch here relating to your intuition disconnect 🐣 A few things that have been helping me feel more comfy n reconnected to mind/body/spirit are things like yoga, meditation, and breathwork. All types of empowering and compassionate, mental and physical exercises. It can be like prayers (maybe put an intentional invitation out to your intuition; a love letter to lost parts of yourself, like a message in a bottle or something idk:)) YouTube has great accessible guided options (“yoga with Adriene” is one of my favorites) but there’s somethin special about the irl class experience. Cheers to the lifelong love story within ourselves"

0,"56:19 PSA: I BEG YOU do NOT get white sage yourself! It's a closed Native American practice, and if you take all of this seriously you should NOT participate in it UNLESS someone from the community agrees to include you (which is what Brittany is planning anyway, I just wish she'd elaborated a bit). If you wanna DIY it, other sages exist, other herbs you can cleanse with exist, alternatives are easy to find! A non-Native American person offering to cleanse your house with white sage is a BIG red flag, too. The debate around white sage is huge in the witch community and you will get so much (justifiable) criticism if you use it without informing yourself!!!"

5,"Soooo if some of the things the psychic told you aren't resonating yet, buckle up. Especially if she seemed legit. My mom went to a psychic about 25 years ago. She told my mother that she would be losing two very close friends, and also told her that she would have two more children. One of which would be a boy. She went on to lose two friends within 6 months, but then nothing. No more children. Hell, she didn't even want any more after me lmao. About 5 years later she had a miscarriage, three years after that she had my brother. That psychic was pretty spot on, even though one of those children resulted in a miscarriage. She's believed ever since my brother was born and confirmed the major things she was told. However, she won't go back to one due to fearing being told she is going to lose another loved one."

2,"So this is a lot to put, but just what I think.

I understand calling it out on how long it took for her to talk about it, and she's even agreed with that on TT. But the amount of hate seems sexist? Hear me out.

H3H3 goes on vacation to isreal, his wife was in the military for isreal, and he was planing on taking his wife and kids there soon even with the genocide. As of now, I have only seen 3 or 4 people talk about that. Brittany fucks up and OWNS UP TO IT, tries to DO BETTER, and she gets shit on this hard? 

People say her music is trash but it's really good, call her unfunny but she is known for making everyone laugh, call her ugly when she's beautiful, but those same people will still be fans of H3H3."

0,"The mental situation you’re having right now sounds a lot like how I felt when I was a regular smoker. I wasn’t even a heavy user, but after years of using a little bit every evening it took a toll on me and I had no idea what was happening. I felt extremely anxious, unmotivated, had no creativity, etc. I’d been depressed before but never for that long. I kept saying I needed a mental reset. I unintentionally took a break for a month and I really quickly noticed a change in my mood. Not saying it’s what you need, but I’d give it a try."

1,38:20 Brittany-I’d 10/10 recommend reading Women Who Run With Wolves by Clarissa Pinkola Estés. If you’re trying to get back in touch with your Intuition this book is all about breaking down myths + stories to help you connect back to your wild self. Its a classic & I constantly go back to it when I feel untethered!

0,"Hello! Just wanted to say that doing some research into energy healing and reiki might be a good next step on your journey!! Energy is linked with your body and your aura, you may find that there is more emotional related things happening with your gallbladder and leg. For instance the gallbladder is linked with the solar plexus chakra and that can be about your own fire and power. That’s just my knowledge on it but I implore you to look into it! It’s a very interesting world!🥰"
1,"Her saying that protestants don’t do exorcisms, I think isn’t entirely true. They don’t do them the way that Catholics do, but it is believed that those who are saved can “deliver” people from demonic spirits by praying over them and “casting the demons out”. At least that was what the protestants I grew up around did. 
Problem being that someone who is “possessed” by a demon might just be a woman who has her own thoughts, or a LGBTQIA+ person, or a person with mental illness, stuff like that."
0,"re: building intuition. I honestly think smoke a bit of weed and write down what you notice. record your thoughts. it's a regressive effect - un-prunes those neural pathways. your perception is wider, your processing is slower but in such a way that you can start to step out of yourself and observe your patterns."
1,"God, listening to Brittany's mom is like listening to my mom. She also has a gifting and has said very similar things about portals, spirits, protection, etc."
1,I need to meet this Chloe lady for a reading asap 😩
0,"It's super interesting listening to the conversation with her mom, specifically talking about exorcisms and there not really being a lot of exorcisms within protestant spaces. I have been in protestant spaces with more of a pentacostal flavor to them (Four-Square, Spoken Word Movement, Bethel's School of Supernatural Ministry etc) where there is a damn demon behind every rock waiting for you. These are the spaces where I have seen the performance of exorcisms, being slain in the spirit, speaking in tongues, etc. It was exhausting."
0,"I am protestant and I never agreed with the ignorance towards demons in the MODERN protestant churches. It was different when Martin Luther started it all. They should get into it again cause girl I have seen and experienced things they dont wanna cover cause they are to focused on not coming off as ""out there""."

Then i returned his photo and said hes gotta go back with the photo, and I've never heard anything else again."
0,I would watch HOURS long breakdown and analysis vids of every single sex and the city episode if Brittney posted it
0,"For intuition. An amazing reader on yt Eso tarot has this saying that I think about whenever I’m debating if my intuition and then subsequent choice is my own or led by someone else. It’s “anxiety screams, intuition whispers”. Well was it a scream or a whisper TF idfk!,Dfhi. Was my initial reaction but when ur at the mental cross roads taking a deep breathe closing your eyes and asking only yourself what you think like you might ask the said person you listen too helps and i feel that is the whisper if you get me."
0,Woo woo girl here 🙋🏽‍♀️ girl your mama even mentioned it when you called her.  It sounds like your third eye chakra is blocked. If you want to connect to your intuition I would go get some reiki done. Then you can use some crystals that open your third eye to help unblock the energy. Reiki can help with that as well. You can also look into other practices that help open this chakra❤
1,My ouija experience changed my life. I have footage of it on my channel. It’s real and y’all should not mess with it. My friends & I were making a joke out of it and I paid the price. Big time. For months.

5,"As a skeptic, I had a CRAZY psychic encounter in college. We had an amazing professor who's wife was a medium. She came one day to read the class. Like i said, I was a skeptic and was really putting up a wall to being 6 During her reading, she came over to me and started telling me how protected I am by ancestors... ok pretty generic... she then started describing a picture of my great grandmother and great grandfather from the late 1800s. I had never told anyone about this picture but I did have it in my childhood room. The medium started describing a specific necklace,a locket, that my great grandmother was wearing in the picture. It had been a while since I looked at the picture and the necklace didn't sound familiar at all. I told her I didn't think k that was correct but she said it was and that i need to have this necklace. When I went home a few weeks later, I looked at the picture. To my absolute shock, there was the locket in the photo, hanging around my grandmothers neck... I decided to call my grandmother and ask about the necklace. She said she did have it somewhere but hadn't seen it in decades. I didn't think much more of it, just kind of cool. THE NEXT DAY my grandmother said her sister had called her and said she found their mother's locket in her vanity and felt like she needed to call my grandmother about it.... my grandmother picked up the locket and got it to me as soon as she could. I have had the locket for years now and um still not sure why i have it and why it ended up with me, but I will say it definitely made me a believer in those with spiritual sensitivity... Wild"

0,"INTUITION TIP: Your intuition is always there, you just need to learn how to recognize it and then (most importantly) act on it. I'm sure you have moments where you have gut feelings about something, but you don't understand why. Or the first thing that pops into your head when being asked a question. It's all about trusting that feeling and ACTING on it. Bc acting on it makes the feeling stronger and easier to recognize. You've probably had it as a child, but someone or something taught you not to trust it. It's always there and it always has been, you just need to learn how to listen and to risk it being wrong, just to find out that you were right all along."
1,I loved what momma broski had to say!!! So cool!
0,"hi brittany, to your question of how to mentally ground yourself better, your main goal would be to meditate. Meditation allows for your mind to understand your soul better and get more aligned with it. Look into different meditation methods. One that works best for me is breath work, if you need a reference. Good luck!!"

0,"Therapist here! Speaking to the intuition piece and connecting with yourself, I would try and find an internal family systems therapist or at least looking into IFS. The main tenet is that there is a Self who is sort of like your core or soul and then there are other parts of you (protectors, managers, exiles, etc) who distract and show up when you are disconnected from Self. Even though it’s a type of therapy it has a spiritual aspect!"

0,"You need to make space to meditate. I know it’s easy to get overwhelmed with that term. But  it’s a very simple practice. Find a moment in your evening time and put on some calm music of your choice or something that’s just peaceful to you, start w/ inhaling slowly for 5 seconds and exhale slowly for 5 seconds, once you get the breathing and counting down, go back to your natural breathing rhythm and allow your mind to have whatever thoughts may pop up, but look at them as logs down a river, just floating by. Acknowledge the thought but don’t dwell. 
Meditation brings you back to your body and your natural rhythm, the more your practice this, the more clarity you will have, health benefits, intuition coming in more clear etc."

0,"Hey, I don’t know if you will see this but as a self proclaimed WOO WOO girlie who has been practicing WOO WOO for about 10 years, I would suggest to use something called Florida Water Cologne. It can be used for protection, purification, strength, and so on. 

It can be used for cleansing and blessing in one step. I don't use sage smoke for cleansing for a few reasons, but one of those reasons is that you need to follow sage with something else for blessing/protecting because of how it works to clear out absolutely everything, including energies or spirits you may want to keep. You need to follow it to put the blessings/protections back in. Florida water will clear out the bad while also blessing and protecting at the same time.

I keep some florida water in a small cosmetic spray bottle at all times. If a room has funky energy in it, I can spray it like a room spray. I can spray it on clothing. I can spray it on myself. Sometimes I spray it in a hairbrush and run it through my hair -- especially after a long, stressful drive on southern California freeways. It's a great way to get the ick off me after a long day of moving through the world and not having a perfect energy shield.

I like to add it to my mop bucket mix when I clean the house as well. I do this about once a month it helps clear out those negative energies and protect your home from people you may invite in that have negative spiritual baggage (wether unknown or not).

For clarification, florida water is not a ""closed practice."" There is no initiation that would earn you the right or ability to use florida water. It is not exclusive to one magical tradition, either, and it has found its way into the WOO WOO practitioners.

You can buy it pretty much anywhere, every metaphysical shop I've visited has sold it, but especially every botanica I've ever visited has it heavily stocked. I prefer to buy from local botanicas so I keep money in the community and support locally owned shops."

There are also a LOT of spiritual podcasts out there that tackle this subject (spiritual shit is my fav) but I also recommend just connecting with nature in any way that grounds you and brings you joy"
0,"For anyone interested in this episode, or if you want to learn more about tarot, check out The Haunted Objects podcast!"
0,"I will say...as a Wiccan who also loves Practical Magic, the aunts said it best: You can't practice witchcraft while you look down your nose at it. Im not saying that's what you're doing, but just be careful what you dabble in. Tarot is a powerful tool if you know how to use it properly. Just do some research before you use it so that it works properly for you! Also you're 100% on the dot when you say manifestation works. It really does, but you can't doubt yourself. You have to be totally in tune with yourself and whatever higher power you choose to follow. Women are divine sacred creatures, and we tend to be more in touch with the eb and flow of things. Follow your gut, trust your heart, and fall in love with yourself before your tall Irish man shows up!! :)"

My dad was a lawyer, always working, and I never felt neglected by him. I used to color on the floor under his desk while he worked on his cases, and on special occasions, I was even allowed to visit the courthouse or go to his office (something that was more frequent when I was a tween/teen). I knew so much legal jargon by the time I was 10, that I knew about 3-4 common motions he used to write and why he would file them (i.e, Motion to Withdraw when he needed to remove himself from a case).

I don't know enough about it but have seen too many negative experiences from curious people online that's led me to just respect what might be the afterlife and stuck spirits and set boundaries out loud. There have been many times where it's felt like someone sitting at the edge of my bed or placing their hand next to me in bed so I just always say out loud that I don't welcome any negative energies in this house and in my mind. What scared me was actually 100% believing I heard my husband say ""hey"" in the doorway of the bedroom when I was awake in bed with my eyes closed. I thought he quickly had to get something but felt weird so I got up and found my husband in the computer room and asked if he said anything to me or went towards the bedroom and he said no. I do believe there be entities that try to mimic people we might trust or love to get our attention and that's a ""oh hell no"" from me."

0,"What is happening to you is a clear example of the deterioration of the Democratic Party and why we will continue to lose elections. The new generation left is cannibalizing their own at such a rapid pace, I am not sure what will be left of it in a decade. It is also a clear indicator of what happens when people don't heal the oppressive trauma they experienced in religious or conservative households. The goalposts have moved on morals and what is right, but the same aggression, demonization of opposition and forceful imposition of one's own beliefs onto others remains. If you swap a few nouns and verbs, those TikTok comments are the same as the MAGAs commenting on a post about gay rights on Facebook. BIGOTS"

0,"Hi Brittany! if you're interested in a book on Tarot; The New Tarot Handbook by Rachel Pollack is a great one that thoroughly covers the origins of Tarot itself as well as each card individually, the various depictions historically of every suit/card throughout different decks, the varying common interpretations by different scholars/individuals. And after each card it gives an entire reading for that card and towards the end of the book it covers a few of the common kinds of readings you can do. I use my deck and the book to read for myself and friends/family; Vis-à-vis spirituality/ interpreting meanings, this book is really helpful for connecting with your intuition and embracing a healthy dynamic with spirituality and rational (I feel you heavily on the fear of religious psychosis, but still feeling an bizarre oxymoronic agnostic spirituality)"

0,"Hi Brittany I love you SO much! You asked for some WOO WOO advice and girl, I’ve been waiting for my moment to shine in these comments 🎉

I’ll make it simple:

1. Bare feet on grass 20 minutes at least few times a week (connects your energy with Mother Earth, proven to heal inflammation all throughout body) 

2. If you sage, or palo santo, open a window before you start and keep it open for at least an hour after you stop dispelling smoke in the air. (The spirits need to leave somehow, they leave through the window.)

3. Crystals - look, they’re beautiful, and they work, but they only work if you do. Charge them in the sun, cleanse them by rinsing or soaking them with water, put them in the corners of your home because those are the densest areas. 

4. While your hair is wet, don’t interact with negative energy. Do interact with nature or meditation. Water absorbs energy. You’ll absorb energy easier in the spiritual realm with wet hair. (Prob why showers bring clarity.)

5. Tarot? I rarely use. I use music. (We both love music so I know you’ll love this one) I simply shuffle my liked songs on Spotify, and ask questions out loud before I do. For example “What do I need to know right now?” I’ll say, then I shuffle, and sometimes I get a song called “water” so I’ll hydrate. Sometimes I get a song like “a little party never killed nobody” and I’ll go party. lol, it’s my favorite divination tool and it’s rare to see people do it. 

That’s just the beginning of quick easy ways to tap into your intuition and protect your space and energy. Hope this helps ❤"
1,"Somewhere along the way, evil, power seeking people made spirituality evil because they know if we listen to our intuition and aren't oppressed by society, then we would all be rich. Idc if that sounds crazy :c them Catholics n governments mayne"
0,"Hey Brittany! I just wanted to let you know to be mindful and careful about sage and getting your house smudged by someone. Smudging is a closed indigenous practice, meaning that tradition is passed down in their culture and there is a specific way to do it correctly and should not be done by someone who is not of that tradition. So if you get your house saged i would hire an actual indigenous person to do it and support native businesses and people. I would not hire just anyone but i know youre smart and wouldnt be willy nilly about it, i just wanted to put that out there. Also if you end up buying sage I would not purchase white sage as it is endangered and the way that businesses harvest it is often unethical. Garden sage will do the same thing, isnt endangered, and isnt culturally disrespectful to use like white sage is. However sage isnt the only herb you can use to cleanse and protect your home. I personally use a dried rosemary bundle that i buy from my local metaphysical store. It has strong protective and cleansing properties and i know many witches who favor it as well! Also if you want to go another step in spiritually protecting your home, getting black obsidian or tourmaline crystals and placing them in the corners of your home after you smoke cleanse your space will help create a barrier that will protect your home and anyone inside. Ive been doing this sort of thing for a few years but of course take what i say with a grain of salt and do your own research if you feel so inclined <3"

1,"I was the biggest skeptic until my girlfriend's otherwise bonkers aunt read my astrology birth chart during our first time meeting, and without hesitation goes ""I keep seeing a major life challenge involving bones and sports? Idk, does that make any sense to you?"" Girl I had multiple reconstructive knee surgeries while playing sports in college...my girlfriend swears up and down that she never said a word to her aunt but either way I was not expecting to be put on blast by the stars like that 😭"
1,"Intuition tip: 
Say you have a decision to make, or your trying to explore if a statement is true to you or not. You can say it out loud and feel if it resonates and contributes or subtracts to your harmony. For example: ""I want to go to the party tomorrow"" pause... Feel... ""I don't want to go to the party tomorrow"". Pause and feel. 
It works as well on statements like ""I like this person/I don't like this person""
This one works for me, got it from a book about shamanism (and fragmented souls). Lots of love ❤"
1,So as a kid who raised llamas for about 10 years I can FINALLY comment as an expert on something Brittany is talking about!!🙏🙏 llamas rarely spit despite what you hear and they really only spit if they’re fighting or if you’re touching their back legs or butt. Their spit is regurgitated food called cud and is usually green from eating  grass and does indeed smell like throw up (it’s really fun when you get spit on in the face with literal green vomit😝). They are very sweet and social and make amazing companion animals and therapy animals! ❤️

0,"For intuition u need to train it like a muscle! it’ll be hard to hear your own intuition for a while so you’ll need to start with practices that focus on quieting the mind like meditation. Having a social media job & just the general fast-paced lifestyle we now live in make it extremely difficult to casually bring into your routine a practice like this but just whenever u remember start focusing on your breath & quieting your mind. Then start journaling. Once your mind is quiet you’ll be able to have more access to your own intuition & knowing. Start journaling about anything, this part is super important because you’re rebuilding that connection to yourself. After all of this work you should be hearing your intuition more, and make sure to always follow it because again it’ll get stronger each time & soon you’ll be fully tapped into your own knowing at all times & it’ll be difficult not to listen to rather than difficult to hear💗"
1,"People need to understand that she's a comedian. Her job is entertainment. I understand the importance of using a platform to bring awarness. But we also need to be aware of how difficult it must be to balance her public persona and politics without changing her usual content too much.

1,"Brittany, I never comment but I feel really called to tell you that I dealt with terrible anxiety in my 20’s, the worst of it being from 25-28. I know this is the most annoying advice ever and it’s also a challenging thing to do, but I PROMISE you, cutting out the high caffeine and weed will significantly change your anxiety for the better. You’ve described the paranoia you feel when you get high, I experienced the same thing and it seemed to linger into my everyday life and cause worse anxiety. I finally decided to put an end to feeling like that and stopped taking edibles/smoking. I also switched to matcha (still has caffeine obviously) but less. If I go out and have a coffee now, I can instantly feel how heightened my anxiety is and think to myself “damn, I was operating like this every day?”. Definitely two things to consider eliminating from your daily life. 
Hoping you see this comment, wishing you a calm nervous system 🙏🏻"

1,"Italian girly here; you pronounced the word ""tarocchi"" correctly, however the o should sound more like the o in the word ""stop"" or ""flop"", while yours sounded like the o in ""cold"" or ""mold"".
In general the letter c in italian usually sounds like a k ( or like  kk if it's double), but if after the c there is an ""e"" or an ""i"", the c sounds more like what in english would be ch, for example the word chair or chocolate. Indeed ""cioccolata"" (chocolate) would sound something like chokkolata. Hope this helped🤗"

0,My favorite research projects are always on this podcast
0,"What has helped me with intuition is not sharing my life as much with those around me. I hear you, I am someone who gets attached to other people’s opinions and beliefs so you do need to try and say less or be less attached to what others say. That way you hear yourself more. Try things like meditation, journaling, or even a space for you to express if you are a verbal processor. Intuition is directly linked to trust so work on trusting yourself. If you make a commitment to yourself, follow through on it, it helps build trust. Also trust your instincts and follow through on that too. This will over time build your intuition muscle. Listen to yourself and your body above all else. Quiet any noise and listen. Intention setting is huge so continue that, go into every day with the intention of listening and trusting yourself. One last thing, in order to receive, make sure you do things that help you ground yourself. Anchor your body and your spirit will bring you answers you need to know"

0,"Hi Brittany, I'm an astrologer and have been into astrology since I've been 13, and I think what you need to do is look up your Chiron placement. That deals with your childhood wounds and how we can work thru them!! I feel like from people who are lost and needed resolution, the Chiron and your north node help a lot. 

I also feel like looking at your Solar Return chart for the year can help you what major themes you need to work on for that year until your next birthday!!

P.S. this may be a controversial take but I'd say look into human design as well. I feel like your issue with your intuition can be solved with practicing and learn how to be more discerning.

I feel like with a Gemini Venus, the fact that you get anxious easily is a problem that all Gemini placements have (myself included as a Gemini rising). We have a tendency to be neurotic and a need to quiet the voices in our head!!

Hope this helps, I've been a big fan of yours for a while"

37,"To answer your question at 37:26, my grandma used to play this card game with me called, “intuition”. She made it up, but basically you get a normal deck of cards, you shuffle them up, and you need to draw the first card without looking at the card. Then you’re supposed to use your intuition and guess the suit and number of the card before you flip it. If you get it right, you keep it by you. If you get it wrong, you put it to side and pull another card. It’s pretty much a game of trust your gut and connect inside. Idk if that’s anything really, but I thought I’d share! :)"

0,"Hi Brittany! Long time watcher, but first time commentor :) You asked for some tips on channelling your intuition, so I wanted  to share some things I do that I find help me a lot. The first is intention setting, but specifically through journalling, goal-setting, or by making physical reminders of things (like a vision board). Having a clear focus on goals and desires helps me block out a lot of backgound noise and be more intentional with my actions. The second is some kind of personal ritual or practice (I read runes for myself) which I find can help me feel more guidance when I'm lost or stuck mentally or physically. You could even get a deck of oracle cards or something where the messaging is clearer right away. Even if you don't believe in the spiritual part of these practices, there is a kind of reassurance from interpreting the readings. If I am stuck on a difficult decision or negative feeling, I try to work through these things by thinking about what result I want instead, and doing a rune reading to get advice on how to achieve it. It has been super helpful, even if it is just giving me a more positive outlook on myself and things to come. A strong intuition (for me) comes from taking care of my mental health, listening to my body or mind when things don't feel 'right,' and focusing on more positive outcomes rather than being distracted by all of the possible negatives. I hope this helps!"
1,Why would you end it on that 😭😭😭😭😭😭 holy fuck
0,"idk what everyone is in these comments about but I love what you said about intuition and tarot! Sometimes people who are just starting to learn about tarot haven’t built up enough knowledge about the symbolism to read the cards intuitively yet but that’s something that you learn along the way! Your intuition is a muscle so you need to act on your “gut feelings” when you get them. When you listen, your intuition will become stronger and you will start to begin seeing things more clearly"

4,"1:13:36 My mother had a similar experience where a spirit mimicked my voice and led her outside. I have been re-painting our front porch recently and went inside to rinse my brush out. I heard my mom open the front door and go out because my little sister was trying to follow her. I went out there to see what she was looking at and she was just standing in the driveway looking at the house. When I asked her what she wanted she said that I called her out there. I told her that I didn't and she said, ""yes you did. You cracked open the door and said momma when you get a second come here."" I didn't do that...and I told her and we just went back inside and discussed it. We are a witchy pagan family and we do have a couple of spirits that pass by. One that has shown up more frequently since I was born was the old gentleman that built this house, we believe it was him that did that as a sign that he likes that I'm fixing up his home because that same exact day 8 years ago, my mother visited his grave (which she later saw on her Facebook memories)"

We had gottem into the habit of asking ""before we go, does anyone have a message for us they'd like to say?"" this time it answered yes, it wanted to tell my friend something. It told us that her mom (used her mom's full name too) would die in 2019 (it was 2016 or 17 at the time) We all kinda freaked and moved on, didnt really think much of it after that as she wasnt even close to her mom at the time. Fast forward to 2019, she and I had grown apart but still talked in class and such, it was the new year and we were talking abou the summer when she told me her mom passed away that summer after they'd reconnected.

1,Brittney I really need you to know that I’m watching this episode while on a 50 mg Eddie and playing the sims
0,"37:01 I am a yoga teacher with over 2000 hours of experience including taking a course on Yoga for the Mind. You might find the Kosha energy body theory and Jungian psychology interesting. The acronym I learned for tools to increase intuition is “DON’T MISS A DAY”. 

D: Dreamwork. Everything in a dream is one part of you talking to another part of you. Everything is symbolic. They’re not prescriptive but descriptive. They tell us what’s going on. 

O: Oracles. Pose a question and ask for guidance. You already experienced how the external answer can confirm the truth of your instinct.

N: Nature & the moon (you got it babe, crystals in the moonlight)

T: turya or “the flow,” engaging in activity where you are immersed and time escapes. For me, crafting in any media. 

M: Meditation. Listen to the space between thoughts. Remember you are not your thoughts but the observer of them. Ask yourself, “I wonder what my next thought will be.” And don’t expect it to not be boring or frustrating sometimes.

I: Intuition. Practice listening to the inner whisper in the loud stadium that feels neutral. Intuition will never come from shame, never says “you must, you ought, you better.”

S: Symbolism/Signs. Notice what you’re thinking about when they show up, e.g. number sequences, song lyrics, birds, butterflies, lady bugs, deer, electrical events, coins, feathers, rainbows, license plates, street signs.

S: Surrender. If the natural unfolding of the process of life can create and take care of the entire universe, is it really reasonable for us to assume that nothing good will happen unless we force it?

A: Automatic Writing. Set a timer or a page number to fill up. Don’t think just go. 

D: [redacted] 

A: Archetypes (Jungian)

Y: Yoga Nidra, supported lying down guided meditation to encourage your brain to hover on the edge of sleep and enter those wavelengths that are good for processing and healing. Great for chronic pain and insomnia."

I was a teen and doing my homework in front of our computer that is situated in the corner of the room, there is a bookshelf behind me at about hip height. I see in the reflection of the computer a white figure behind the bookshelf move to the right towards the wall. I’ve never ran out of a room so fast. A day or two later I was talking to my mom in the same room, I looked at the bookshelf where the ghost/spirit went into the wall and in the carpet is a child sized pair of foot prints facing into the room. I get scared easily by ghost stories so my heart is racing recalling this."
0,Guys omg... I thought Venmo was for paying people....... Wtf that's cwazy...
0,"I think Puritans had similar rituals to exorcize an evil spirit, but it's not an exorcism because that's a Catholic ritual sanctioned by the Vatican. Since Puritans disagreed with a centralized religious power like the Vatican, they probably left it up to local parishes to develop their own versions of excising a demon or spirit (think of the witch trials for example). 

ps brittany do you need a jstor login??? i feel like it would give you access to papers with the answers haha"
0,It’s kinda scary hearing you talk to your parents bc you’re literally them. To a tee. like they said copy mf paste thoughts words and deeds
0,"@37:00 As a Wiccan and self identified “woo woo bitch” who practices in solitude, in my personal experience, the best way to sharpen your intuition is to meditate. (🧘‍♀️ this position, open palms facing up for receiving, palms facing down for grounding, quiet dark space, whatever else you need to help focus i use binaural beats idk, it just works) Focus as much as you can on achieving a silent mind, allowing your thoughts to come and go freely without over analyzing them. From there focus your intention on listening to your subconscious, listening to the inner voice that knows, confidently, what you know to be true about yourself & your surroundings as well as your deepest desires. If you can, write down what you’ve learned from your meditation in a journal, or just reflect on it for a while. 
In your daily life, try not to search too much for messages and answers everywhere, it’ll drive you crazy. Instead try to pay attention to moments in life that have an underlying significance, even if they seem otherwise innocuous, allow or facilitate those moments to happen, and afterwards reflect on how that moment changed you and/or the word around you. 

At the end of the day trust your gut, listen closely to the people and situations around you, and pay attention to the patterns and routines each person/thing follows, you will thus better be able to intuitively have an idea of what will happen next.

And if you want to know what color candle’s are best to burn while you meditate they’re:
Purple: Psychic, Intuition, prophetic dreams
White: spirit, guardian angels, purity 
Black: protection, magic, etc."

They start playing with the Quija board, but her and another girl didn’t want to. After enough peer pressure she finally gave in and asked a question (one that she knew no one else knew so she could feel reassured that it was all phony). She asked what her older sister’s dog’s name was. The board spelled out Nikita and my mom called her mom to come pick her up because she was so scared.
FYI her older sister was ten years older and had moved far away because she was in the military"
0,not even broski nation is safe from the venmo ad 😔
1,i love when i hear about your moms stories
3,"I’ve learned that intuition feels like “love” and like an all knowing. Like the thought is simply truth. It should never feel anxious and if it does it isn’t intuition. To strengthen it, you simply need to practice noticing it and actually acting upon it. Actually acting on it helps you strengthen your trust with yourself  and heighten your tuition❤️"
6,"Connecting with intuition advice —- I always start to feel how you’re describing when I don’t spend time off screens, or always consuming something. Spending time with your thoughts, gardening and listening to nature, connecting to yourself.. corny but meditating.. helps build that connectivity to yourself back up and you’re right. Helps a lot with depression, for me!"

1,"Brittany, or anyone else who’s reading: The most helpful thing I’ve ever heard about intuition is that when your intuition is speaking to you, it makes you feel very calm—literally slows your nervous system down and puts you at peace. Sometimes our anxieties can feel just as “true” as our intuition but I think that’s the difference. Your body ultimately knows what you need."
0,Tarot reading for myself has been super impactful as a tool of self-reflection and exploration of my subconscious! I'd say discovering it was definitely one of the main catalysts for my journey in connecting deeply to my intuition and strengthening my third eye.
0,"18:14 so nice to hear you talk about your upbringing and divorced parent scenario  - I didn’t realize (and I’ve been watching you since 2019) that you were a half sibling to your “siblings” and you’d never know if not hearing this story. I grew up saying the same in conversation, it’s one, easier… but also it’s a “chosen family” thing where we never called each other half-siblings or anything to explain the backstory - we were all just siblings. Brothers and sisters, with more parents involved but no bad blood! It doesn’t always have to be out of a terrible situation that divorce is the outcome. Xo just wanted to say same gf!"

Just trust your gut, initial instincts, and intuitive voice in your head!"

0,"I will never not share my experience with a Shaman. It was unexpected but not a coincidence in the least. I was to see this client that was not assigned to me (their former worker had quit or for fired for reasons I’m not sure). Before I left the office to drive to the address that indicated it was an apartment building I was already frustrated because I had got lost and wasted time before finding other clients in their apartment homes. I finally found the place and she’s hesitant to let me in but I could tell she was excited. As we step through the doorstep there’s a ziploc bag with water Pennie’s and I notice it immediately because my Hispanic family would use those sometimes to deter the flies while we ate outside. She had it hanging for a different reason. I quickly learned that the ziploc bag was to ward off evil. I saw altars in every corner of her small apartment, her nephew had his room in the living room and was taking a call. The lights were off but it was not dark or eerie since there was light coming through the window. She showed me her altars because I think she felt my nervous energy. As she showed me the altar in her closet with nothing else in it, she said “I know you’re here to help me but I need to give you this information”. She starts to say I had an uncle to the left of me and told me “your uncle used to give you money”. Not as a question but a fact. Then she took us to the living room and tells me my grandma is on my right and that she hummed while cooking (she passed when I was 3 or so and wouldn’t know but she was an amazing cook according to my mom and everyone. She asked if I had a little sassy dog because the dog was w at her in a sassy way (my dog passed when I was 15). She saw a bunch of puppies running around (my dog passed fixing birth to her last litter and I didn’t get to say goodbye). She guessed some other “thoughts” or “beliefs” I have of my husband (that I wished he was manlier 😂-love him though). She kept reiterating that I needed to “light the fire” and that I was gifted. She was the second person to tell me this aside from the doctor that helped my mom bring me into the world (apparently I stood up when I was born). Lastly as I was leaving she hesitated to ask, while making a circular motion as if she was rubbing her belly, “did you lose a baby?”. I was in a bit of shock when she mentioned that because no one knew that other than my husband and my  close friends. I almost cried when she said, “your grandma is holding him in a blue blanket”. She then asked if I had a brother and struggled to say “make sure you hug him he may need it more than you know”. Her last words were “I have so much more to tell you but I know you have to go and it was not a coincidence that you’re here and even though you were frustrated coming here because I saw you being upset of having to come I glad you did”."
0,looking extra delicious as always miss leader
0,"About the question on why there aren't exorcisms in Protestants organizations within Christianity, there are! In Pentecostalism (yeah the weird one, I grew up in it) its called ""deliverance ministry"". Its kinda like your mom said that its more like just trying to get a spirit to leave via using God's authority, not necessarily like exorcising a ""possessed"" person. But I have seen someone be ""delivered"" (its super freaky ngl and I still don't know what to make of it). My grandpa was a pastor for decades who had prayed over other people a few times to get rid of a spirit. Its definitely an interesting part of Pentecostalism (like many other things...)"

0,"The best thing that I suggest from my experience to start reconnecting with your intuition is to reconnect with nature. I go outside and stand or sit and try to feel grounded, I also try to really focus on my surroundings while doing this. Another thing is trusting that first gut instinct and not writing it off as being anxious about that person/ thing. Trust in your self and that your decisions are what is right for you is incredibly important. I know this seems obvious but I try to remind myself of this kinda thing as often as possible. Also tarot is tea hell yea"

3,"Anxiety screams your intuition whispers. It’s about tuning into your heartspace over your mind. Your mind can only logically understand so much but the heart perceives far beyond the physical senses ie the subtle energies that always exist around us. It’s about finding stillness within and getting out of your mind and into your heart and body. My intuition speaks to me thru gut / body feelings. That feeling of “yes” or “no”. You can practice with smaller things like for instance what type of food to order or which way to drive home etc and just see where it leads you. It’s about getting quiet enough so you can hear it and listen which requires us from learning how to quiet the mind and not be so dictated by others or our conditioning or our rampant thoughts. Recognize where you begin and others end. 

It’s an everyday process but it’s like a muscle. It’s really just a matter of tuning into yourself and what you are feeling. Usually for me takes intentional time in stillness and solitude and just breathing and allowing myself to relax before my inner being / intuition really comes out. How can it come out if your system and your mind are clogged with other people’s energy, worries, fear c etc. 

I’ve learned you can’t “think”
Yourself into your intuition. Your mind should see your heart as the master, not the mind as the master. But our society conditions us to be so in the mind that it controls us. You can’t “think” yourself out of anxiety. Often times there are just different parts of us that want to be heard and acknowledged. Your mind is full of bias and thoughts and conditioning from the people around you or the way you grew up or whatever. It’s usually not our own belief systems until we actively challenge our belief systems and question what do we believe and why? 

Again drop into your body and your heart space. Yoga and walking have been very helpful when I’m in an anxious mind. There are so many free guided meditations that are really helpful at helping you relax and guiding your mind into peace. I hope this helps someone! I know it’s a lot and maybe not totally cohesive but it’s what I felt called to share

There are free videos online here on YouTube that also can help you practice and explain it more so research and experiment!"
1,"root chakra sleep meditation is so so good for grounding and intuition. meditation can be hard (adhd asd hi) so I weirdly trick my brain into letting go w the intention of sleep ??? and i swear it works miracles i wake up feeling anew. when my brain is super active guided meditation is great (for beginners i recommend) or if I just wanna go to bed / wind down just the frequency music makes a huge difference. for me, i feel my intuition in my belly so w everything going on with your health it makes sense to have lost that sense of self guidance. it's all connected... i don't super deeply understand chakras (i feel like we are aligned in our beliefs) but i find this sleep meditation method so helpful. love you for all you do"

1,"""It's real if you want it to be real."" Yeah that's...any belief lol. Jesus walked on water if you believe that he did. Aliens secretly live among us on earth if you believe they do. That doesn't mean it's actually real. Just because you believe in something doesn't make it real. Just because it makes you tingle doesn't mean it's real. 
I'm really scared that people don't care about science anymore. Maybe most people never did, but...idk, society is falling apart because people just make up realities that don't exist just because they want it to exist - like, idk, the current government? What happened to fact checking and real research? None of us want to live in reality anymore. And that's because it sucks, I get it, I don't like paying attention either because there's nothing I can do about it so why would I just make myself feel like shit by thinking about it too much? But that doesn't mean I give up on logic and reason when confronted with reality. Can someone looking at cards and telling you things make you feel better? Sure. But so can actual mental therapy. You know, educated and licensed professionals who know how the brain works? Did we forget about seeing real doctors instead of snake oil salesmen? Gurl if you're anxious and paranoid all the time...go to a real doctor? Just because your brain is creating thoughts doesn't mean you should believe them. Our brains can do crazy shit. Idk...Brittany's so smart so that's why this bothers me. I know humans genuinely want to feel connected and to feel like life has meaning and purpose and all that, but do we have to believe in dumb shit to feel that? Can we have community and connection without harmful beliefs? Not that tarot has killed millions in wars like toxic religions have, but... to me this is also the same shit that's keeping humans back, the same shit we were dealing with in the 40s that she was talking about with Orwell. We want to believe what feels good instead of what's actually true. That's what's wrong with humans."

Anyway give it a chance!"
0,Regarding the exorcism question with why don't protestants have a Cretella like the Catholics do for exorcisms. I believe that would be because protestants do not recognize the need for a priest and only priests in Catholicism carry out exorcisms so there would be no official way other than what is listed in the Bible since protestants believe in solar scripture on how to get rid of a unclean spirit in a person.

0,"Idk if you’re gonna see this but, if you want to practice your intuition, don’t listen to anyone else. Don’t google what you’re supposed to do, don’t ask for advice, don’t overthink about if you’re doing it right or not. Listen to yourself, you can do it :) do exactly what you feel is right and do your best to trust yourself. Remember there is no right way to be and no one human knows the answer. Your perspective is just as valid as anyone else’s in the world."
0,The way I decipher if something is anxiety or intuition is focusing on where I’m feeling that feeling in my body. Is it in my stomach or chest? If it’s in my chest it’s anxiety and if it’s in my stomach it’s intuition.

Sometimes when I’m feeling a little stressed and blocked, I need an aid to guide me through. Another thing I recommend is cleansing you and your space. There’s many ways you could do this: taking a bath with some nice smelling bath salts, sitting with yourself and really thinking about you and your life thus far, etc. And cleansing the space around you could mean lighting some incense, getting crystals for cleaning (I recommend selenite), or even just some relaxed cleaning—nothing too strenuous.

But more like a book recommendation, I really suggests reading The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron is a great book to connect with yourself (even if you are not a artist). And no it is not a self-help book like people say sometimes, it is a workshop in book format, so you  have to try the things she is proposing for you to do ."

0,"HI MOTHER- I can read tarot. Yes, a lot of it is interpreting the cards in combination (as though they tell a story), but it’s also heavily on intuition in the sense that your mind is guided to what needs to be said and feelings arise in the body (for example, heaviness if the card is meant to be interpreted negatively). 
You are so correct on speaking things into existence! However, existence does not need to mean the public and I think this is what the reader meant. While your intentions may be good, it can reach the wrong people who could negatively intersect what it is you’re trying to manifest. Think of the evil eye, your manifestations need protection from others envy!"

0,"you talking about feeling disconnected from your intuition reminded me of a poem by the artist Zheani

""A woman is ground down and shredded by the masses of mankind. Her individual spirit and connection to the great Mother (Earth) is disrupted by the shriek of the modern world. An unnatural cacophony makes it near impossible to hear the turning of the earth. Listen close to the chaos beneath your skin."""

0,"I have literally realised that it choosing all the best choices for myself eg not drinking so much caffeine, not engaging in social media mon- 
Fri and also walking meditation and really focusing on my body dyphramic breathing I feel has given me the ability to actually notice when I am tense like in my shoulders and back are tight and I have a head ache when my forehead and face is tense but I don’t realise. I think it’s actually paying attention to yourself now I will admit I find this easier to do through semi isolating when I am building my routines.

0,"Tarot girlie here to answer your questions!! Like mentioned, the cards are just a tool, like how paint and a canvas are tool for art, they’re just objects.

The common version of tarot that we’re familiar with today took shape in the early 20th century with members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn creating the Smith Rider Waite (SRW) deck, illustrated by Pamela Coleman Smith. The symbolism and illustrations in this deck were inspired and pulled from lots of different cultures and religions such as Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, and the imagery has influenced most of the decks we see today. Though a deck doesn’t have to reference the SRW in order to be classified as tarot. 

On to your other big question- are all tarot readers psychics with a wide-open third eye? No. I’ve been reading for a decade now, and while I feel in touch with my intuition and aware of energy, I don’t consider myself a psychic or clairvoyant in anyway. And I know others feel the same. Like I said, the cards are just a tool. You can use them for journal prompts or you can channel spirits- it’s totally up to the reader and their intentions.

For me, tarot is a deep self-reflective practice. And with clients it’s like “there’s 78 cards in a deck, these are the 10 that I pulled. Why these ones? What story do they weave together and what are they pulling up in you?”

Anyway- I hope you’re having fun with discovering and experiencing all of this woo stuff! Every time I get my palms read it completely blows my mind"

0,"GIRL, I JUST HAD A TAROT READING THIS WEEKEND"
2,Hi here to tell you that the 10th of July is on a Thursday
0,"The shortest version of answering the intuition question is to practice listening to yourself. We do it all the time, we're just not aware of it all the time. When we aren't doing it, that's usually when we're considering someone else's POV or potential feelings about whatever we're doing. When you act without trying to please anyone else, you're listening to yourself. When something comes up and you feel a way about it, follow that feeling. Now, is your gut feeling fallible? Yes, because you (we) are fallible. Are you still worth listening to? Always. When you're making decisions and you're like, ""yes, this feels right,"" you're listening to your intuition. Operate under your own influence and not the influence of the ""invisible audience"". 
Lots of spiritual stuff is just kind of spicy psychology, lol. Which, for me, makes it much easier and wayyy less spooky when trying to understand spiritual or philosophical concepts. 
Anyway! Have a lovely day everyone!"
0,"If you want to strengthen your intuition and get into tarot buy a deck, shuffle it, pull a card and think.. what does the imagery mean to you? On the card, what does the art say? How does it feel?? Then look at your guidebook and see what the true intention of the card is. You will learn a lot about yourself, your intuition, and the cards. So excited for this new journey from you!"

25,"46:18 Italian Broski nation responding🫡 The letter C can be both hard (like in chaos) or soft (like in child), and it's the same when they are double. To understand when is hard or soft you have to look what letter is after it. If there is an A, an O or an U is hard (ex. BOCCA that means mouth is pronounced bokka), when there is an E or an I is soft (ex. FACCIA that means face). however, there's the H that in our language is a special letter (beacuse it's known as the silent letter) that is used to harden the soft combos. so if CI is prounanced with the soft C, if you throw an H in the middle (CHI) it transform into an hard sound (so ki). so the word tarocchi has the hard sound C because there is the H"

1,"Pastor’s daughter here 👋🏼

I grew up in the church, my dad’s been a pastor my entire life. and as Protestants in the Assemblies of God, our approach to spiritual warfare is very different from what people typically think of as “exorcisms.”

We don’t practice formal or ritualistic exorcisms because we believe those traditions lean more on ritual than Scripture. Instead, we emphasize deliverance, which is completely rooted in the Bible. There’s nothing theatrical or superstitious about it. it’s prayer, authority in Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit.

My dad has experienced spiritual warfare firsthand many times, including situations where people were clearly under demonic influence. In those moments, he simply prays and rebukes the spirit in the name of Jesus. That name carries real, biblical power.

Even today, possession still happens, even in large gatherings and conventions. Many elders have said it seems less common now, and honestly, it makes sense. The world is so spiritually lost already, it’s like the enemy doesn’t need to fight as hard anymore."

0,"Tuning into your intuition!: literally Google ""head, heart, gut tuning"" you will find examples of how to practice where you ""feel it"". 

IMO it's more than just your gut, that's only part of it! Here's what works for me: get into a comfortable position and relax. Now think about your feelings towards your mom (or someone else who makes you feel loved and safe): do you feel it in your gut? Sit with it. Next, do you feel it in your heart? Next do you feel it in your brain? 
Now think about someone you despise or has hurt you and do the same. How does it feel different?

It is a skill that takes repetition and practice but has helped me tune into myself in the moment and not second guess later!"
1,"as someone who is pretty indulged in the spiritual aspect and can also very much relate to the people pleasing wound, grounding techniques help my nervous system so so much. Whether that’s affirmations, meditation, talking to yourself out loud on what is weighing you down, grounding techniques can really help release your anxiety. For me, when I don’t do anything about my nervous system when it’s screaming at me, I go into a survival and avoidant state, that leads into depressive episodes and symptoms.

Taking time to listen to your body and thoughts, and figuring out what messages your body is trying to tell you, like whether it’s your nervous system screaming at you or it’s your intuition and your heart trying to tell you something, can really help you become more grounded. 

I’m definitely no professional, but I have been in a hermit state for so so long and im aware of my own patterns and triggers, I really think trying grounding techniques can help you significantly. 💜"

0,"Have you ever considered that the feeling you have about your intuition has to do with leaving Christianity? Let me explain: I also left the cult I was born and raised in - 4th generation, left at 30years old. And I have a hard time with my intuition/decision making etc. my therapist has said that it could attribute to the fact that one, my ADHD, and two, the church/cult taught me that my inner conscious was bad and could lead me to sin or think sinful thoughts, so I couldn't trust myself. If you condition this with other maladaptive behaviors such as cherry picking bible verses, purity culture, shame, feeling unworthy, etc, it's almost engraved in a person when it's happening during our most formative years (young teens).

I ponder about this all the time. It's very interesting to me now, post-cult life lol"
1,37:18 unfortunately there is no crystal or crystal juice that can shortcut you there. It truly is connecting with yourself connecting with nature and connecting with other people. One of the connections is not that strong and that's why you're struggling. I suggest going into nature whichever nature is your favourite spend time with it because you do spend time with a lot of people and you do spend a lot of time with yourself but do you actually spend time with your self
1,36:14 also spend time in nature. I'm not kidding we exist to take care and love ourselves each other and nature and that happens both ways. We can't take care of ourselves if we don't use other people and nature and we can't take care of each other if we don't use ourselves and nature and we can't heal nature if we don't use ourselves and each other.✨

2,"I’m sure you and your mom might have talked about it already, but to answer your question about the lack of protestant cleansing practices and exorcisms (I was raised in and out of a lot of different christian churches around the midwest), most of them would say they don’t believe humans have the power to “bless, cleanse” or otherwise perform any spiritual rituals of meaning because they believe that power lies solely within christ and God. Not that I necessarily believe we don’t have spiritual energies that some may or may not be more attuned to, but that’s what the narrative always was in church for us!"
0,"28:58 there's nothing out there to believe in the thing that you're believing in is yourself THE SELF consciousness itself is what creates our reality. We exist to love and take care of ourselves each other and nature. This is our existence. This is what you're feeling. this is what religion tries to teach people but it falls short because it actually takes away the power from the self and nature and gives it to an imaginary person or persons which makes people more easily manipulated but actually the power simply lies in yourself and nature and this present reality, this present moment, this is where all of the power is, all of the love🫶"

0,"Italian Broski nation here: the double ""c"" just strenghtens and elongates the sound. What that ""c"" sound is depends on the letter that follows it. It's soft in front of ""i"" and ""e"" like in ""ciao"", ""certo"" and it's a hard ""k"" sound in front of other letters. But what if you want to pronounce a hard ""k"" before ""i"" and ""e""? That's when you add the ""h"". E.g. ""chi"" sound like ""qui"" in the spanish word ""aqui"" whereas ""ci"" sounds like ""chea"" in ""cheap"". When it comes to double letters, what we refer to as ""doppie"", those are just double letters that we write down to specify that the sound has to be a little harder/longer.

38,"Regarding healing your self trust/intuition: as a child, you learned that to feel safe/accepted you had to neglect your needs and wants to please the people around you, in this process your nervous system learns, “my thoughts aren’t valid because they don’t keep me safe” so you reject your thoughts, feelings, authenticity, desires, trying to stay “safe”. Your ego gets bigger and bigger as you try harder to please and hide your authentic self. Your ego is just trying to protect you, so when you start to feel your ego creeping in, or your people pleasing tendencies arise, place your hand over your heart, feel into your bodily sensations and speak to yourself gently, “I feel you are scared, this is an old fear, we do not need to be scared in our current reality, we are free to feel and release this fear now” and allow your body to feel discomfort, big emotions, or seemingly nothing until you feel ready to move on with your task/day. As you are in this healing process, you should be checking in with your body many times a day to honor and tune in to what your body is authentically feeling. What you are doing is building inner safety and trust with yourself. Put yourself first and practice setting healthy boundaries that honor your authentic feelings. Learning to do this takes a long time, years. But consistent practice is how you recalibrate and learn to strengthen your intuition. I have been on this journey the past 2 years and it is hell but it is necessary. ✨💕 wishing you luck"

0,Why did I just start rewatching AMERICAN HORROR STORY yesterday and the first season is about ghosts being tethered to the murder house … I love being in sync with madam broski
0,I WILL BE VENMO-ING NOTHING
0,LOVE how we got a follow up on the psychic reading 💖 best way to connect with your intuition is meditate. It's really hard at first but stick with it! Yoga is great too!!
0,37:40 “THERE ARE THINGS IN THIS WORLD THAT WE MAY NEVER TRULY UNDERSTAND understand WE WANT ANSWERS” how do I uninstall this
0,"Intuition comes from inside and there is nothing external you can do. 
Connect with the body, sing dance stretch freely…get into a flow state then meditate. 
Visualize you highest self. This can be non human, it can be a different era, wear different clothes than you.. but picture who they are, how they hold themselves, what totems do they hold. Get to know them overtime and ask them questions. 
Follow the feeling and know there will always be doubt
Ketamine therapy is great as well: BetterU has been great for at home therapy. Great for intuition and self discovery."
0,"thank you for putting your thoughts in the intro, i'm sick of these kids on tiktok. bet, now they'll all hate because ""she only did it bc we came for her/it's too little too late/she's still friends with so-and-so"" give me a break. brittany has always been up front about her feelings on these topics and actually does productive things to help instead of just doing lip service on social media, just because their entire worldview only comes from tiktok doesn't make that less true."
0,Her hair is sooooooo slay 🤭🤭
0,"The newer Sex and the City show is good but very predictable if that makes sense, also lots of new characters to learn and I keep mixing them up😭😭"
0,Manifesting you meet hozier again.
0,37:19 I found that trying to make a daily habit of reading my own tarot was connect myself to trusting and starting to differentiate my anxieties from my intuition. I find often times I will ask the deck is my intuition correct and it will give me a card to reinforce to trust my intuition versus if my feelings are only out of a place of fear it will tell me to temper my expectations.
2,"Supreme Leader Broksi, it would be great if, when learning about something or Googling something to clarify information, not using the Google AI, as it is most likely not correct or accurate"
2,I've been waiting for her mother to talk about this scary shit again 🎉

0,BRITTANY THAT RIFF AT THE BEGINNING PUT ME INTO CARDIAC ARREST
0,The same people calling her out are the same hoes who wouldn’t be seen “doing enough”. She’s doing what she can and God bless our supreme leader.
0,The Venmo commercial is killing me!!!!
0,Hey you should read Women Who Run with the Wolves by Clarissa Pinkola Estes if you want to connect with your feminine intuition!!! It basically dissects a bunch of different folklore stories from different cultures in the context of women's intuition and creativity. It is very woo woo but the messaging is really fun to explore. Plus some of the stories are quite short so it's one of those books you can keep coming back to.
0,The James Joyce shade had me 😂
0,"I went to see a psychic who was spot on about mostly everything. She gave me months of events & initials of people who were involved. She also told me I wasn’t ready to hear some things & to call back on NYE . I seen her in July btw when I was in a good place in my relationship. By November, I felt my relationship falling apart but I tried to grasp it as best as I could & make it work. I called her on NYE & she told me “Let him go. You’re getting rope burn from holding on.” 😲"
0,"I don’t see any comments talking about the tapping into intuition and divine feminine stuff so I figured I share some of my (minimal) experience. Maybe you could look into the deity Persephone and rituals that resonate with her practice and  read up on your cycle and how it’s connected to the moon cycle. Also, but you mentioned you kinda do this already, start being more mindful in small moments, connect with nature in your very own ways, have a walk barefoot in the rain, have bath in the light of the full moon - whatever feels right to you. The same goes for crystals (maybe rosequartz & amethyst?) and candle magick/herbs/runes/spells etc., read on their qualities and origins. For example, because you’ve mentioned going, go to a crystal shop and try out holding different crystals connecting with the energy, tap into the feeling it creates and yeah.That’s kinda all ig, I also really fw Hecate and the symbolism of the triple moon goddess but that’s just me :) love from Germany xx"
1,waiting for the reaction with the whole miranda and the doctor next week LMFAOOOOO
0,as someone who is both woo woo witchy and into the psych field what helped me so much is downloading free therapy worksheets especially on identity. i love therapy but my memory is horrible and i forget what my therapist says to me a lot. i started writing it down after my sessions & then downloaded some random worksheets. i’m such a visual person. Then i also gave myself a tarot reading.
0,Try taking magnesium for the leg spasms!
2,please Brittany sipping her redbull @ 2:01 sounded like the sipping sound on Roblox 😭
0,"Being ""psychic"" is a latent human ability. 
In my opinion, it's better described as ""field reading."" Our brains and bodies operate off of bioelectric currents. We all have receptors, as well. Some humans have more awareness and understanding of their reception...they train this into deliberate sensitivity. Some people process more data from the ""field"" but just lack the conscious framework to name it. 
My point is, it's accessible to everyone. Body intelligence precedes critical thinking. The enteric nervous system (gut-brain) and vagal tone influence mood, intuition, and even decision-making BEFORE one ""makes a decision."" 

What we call “intuition” or “psychic” is often just somatic intelligence that someone has been attuned enough to decode into conscious thought.

Tarot cards provide an external scaffolding to allow field reading to be ""broken down"" into smaller pieces...the archetypical imagery provides anchors that your subconscious interprets for introspection and decoding.

This IS NOT divination. NOT the supernatural. It's analytical reflection."
1,I’m a Christian and have never wanted to do tarot cards or palm readings lol. I go to the Lord for my questions not Satan
0,took you long enough
0,Hi Supreme leader! 🫡 just wanted to report that those cinnamon brooms they seek during the fall season can also be used for protection 🤗 cinnamon is a key ingredient to bring abundance as well as provide protection for your household 😌
0,"I feel like the people who say that ""And Just Like That"" is bad have not realized that it's as out of touch, unrealistic and romanticized as ""Sex and the City"". Like, the way they modified Miranda's archetype, brought in a new POC to undertake a similar Miranda archetype, added another POC to take on Samantha's archetype... it all plays into SatC. Storylines are similar, actors are just as great, etc. Y'all just didn't realize that the whole cast/writers/etc are boomers/Gen X and they still function as such."
0,I think it’s funny how people say “she doesn’t care about it” and they obviously haven’t seen ANY of her insta stories that are full of links for organizations and charities…makes me giggle

0,I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO.
0,"Hey Brittany - a woowoo person here!

There are 2 YouTube channels i can recommend for you to gather more information about the spiritual/occult world and witchcraft! 

Darby Valentine - well educated and research loving occultist. Has 2 wonderful historic-accurate YouTube videos on Tarot and Ouija boards.

Embracing Magick - podcast channel of 3 wonderful, experienced witches from UK. They mostly talk about witchcraft, connection to your spirituality, ancestors and divine feminine. They're all about sisterhood, embracing your femininity and building women only community where everyone can feel safe. Even if you're not into witchcraft i would recommend listening to at least their video about ""Witchcraft Misconceptions"" and ""Healing Through Witchcraft"". Hope this will help!

Thank you and stay safe everyone!"
0,"I know you’re getting a lot of heat online right now, just know that I’ve noticed every time you’ve shouted out the social issues happening. I appreciate this break you provide us and I’m personally happy you don’t talk allll the way about it. I do hope you make a political propaganda fart history episode though, I’m curious your takes on current propaganda"
0,"36:57 For connecting with your intuition, whenever you feel that ""I'm an animal being hunted"" anxiety, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and try to center yourself and ""listen"" to your heart. For some people, that listening and intuition comes naturally, but for me, I have to quite literally envision my heart in my chest and just like... think of what it would want to tell me. Sometimes it's simple stuff like ""you should drink water"", but sometimes it's serious shit like ""you need to stop talking to this person"" or ""you need to get in your car right now."" All of that anxiety you're experiencing, while it is exacerbated by the edibles and the redbull, is also your body telling you that something is wrong and needs changing. Also, if you've read this far, I love you to death girl, drink water, eat some cabbage or something, take a nap, and have a good week!"
0,"Some notes I learned from magicians and ""psychics"" about cold reading people: 
 A) Any number they give for your ""lucky"" number you would have found a connection to because your brain naturally wants you to find connections and patrerns. 1-12 it's a brth month, 1-31 it's someone's birthday, 30+ it's someone's age or birth year etc. Same goes for days of the week.
B) You are an outgoing confident woman so guessing you will be successful is both obvious and a bit of flattery to butter you up. 
C) It's an educated guess that you might have stomach and leg problems based on modern garbage diets and lack of exercise most people get nowadays. They could say that to anyone and it would probably hit for them. (Especially if you mentioned or had a coffee/energy drink with you)
D) Telling you that you need to trust your intuition? You came to a psychic, you obviously have stuff you want to ask or have confirmed and don't trust your own intuition on it. Why else would you come?
Not saying all psychics are scammers, but you gotta take anything from someone claiming to have superpowers with a grain of salt. Especially when money us involved."
0,"girl are YOU psychic?! my sister is getting me into sex and the city and i just did a speech on the history of tarot...GET OUT OF MY HEAD BRO

also there’s a fascinating book called Mystical Origins of the Tarot by Paul Huson that definitely enhanced my own study of the cards when i practice reading the cards"
1,"That’s interesting you posted this episode and talked about getting into your woo-woo era while I’m getting out of it now 😂 I literally got rid of my tarot and oracle decks today cause I felt like I should and the universe/God wanted me to cause it’s not in alignment with me anymore. it’s been a healing and interesting journey.. 

I wish you a safe journey into this side of spirituality! Just be careful of the content you consume! It can get addicting and make you lose touch with your intuition even more if you focus more on external voices! Also, you don’t need to buy crystals or whatever to protect your house. Like you could if you want to, but there’s also energy and power in your words, like setting intentions or praying, and/or visualizing. You can just pray or ask angels or God or cleanse your space and protect it.. 

Please try to connect deeper with your intuition so that you can avoid falling into traps and causing yourself harm. I know you’re struggling to do that, what works for me when I feel like I lost touch with myself is avoiding spiritual content and doing some writing/journaling. Try asking questions and having convos with yourself, it might help you too. Stay safe 😊💕"
1,I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT YOUR MOM AND WHY YALL HAVENT DONE MORE CONTENT!!! This is gonna be a good one
2,"37:33 take some mushrooms and revel in the feeling that you are not in control but you are connected and with effort and good intention your efforts won’t go unnoticed, and you can find some real peace there. That kind of clarity can boost your intuition, give you permission to trust yourself."

0,"You just need to have faith girl, in whatever way you choose to live in faith… and to live life and stop thinking about it. You’re not gonna learn it all or be able to answer it all or use science and reading and whatever to as why forever. Gotta stop! Wasn’t the point faith love and trust. Your bad friend is drew I have insane intuition lollll (will be coming back to my guess)"

1,"Anyone can grow their own White Sage (Salvia apiana) if you have a pot of soil or a small 1x1 foot area!  It's much more sustainable and better for than the environment.   Plus it's very cool to know you grew and rolled your own smudge stick.
Btw: that greyhound story mama told broke my heart.   Such a horrible thing to lock ANY animal up.  So sad:(  I love paranormal things and believe in spirits and other realms, but sometimes it sucks.  I hope that dog can be free someday"
0,"I’m Italian, and I’m gagged, didn’t know it was in any way connected to Italy. Here it is called tarocchi, with the pronunciation of “ch” you are right, the first part of the word is TA not TE which is a common misconception. In the us they have a completely different pronunciation of the letter a, I couldn’t compare it to any other word to make you understand because in Italy we pronounce it completely different."
0,"Italian learner here, real italians feel free to clock me... the ""soft"" and ""hard"" c sound in italian is determined by the following letter
Ca, co, cu produces the hard sound, and ci ce produces the soft sound. An h is added to get the hard chi and che sounds, and an I is added to get the soft Cia, cio, and ciu. A double constant is for extra emphasis on the letter. I think my Italian pronunciation is pretty good, but my vocab sucks lmao 😭."

2,BRITANNY PLS READ THIS LOOK UP VIPASSANA AND DO A COURSE I PROMISE YOU WILL HEAR THAT INTUTION PLEASE
2,"As someone who is spiritually connected, the idea of an image conjuring in your mind is so true! I’ve never encountered animals in a home but I have seen them in the forests that I live by. Spirits do show themselves to me in my mind as well. I have seen little people. I have seen shadow people both good and bad. I am also Native American and I do practice my traditional beliefs to guide me through these interaction."
0,"imo the best way to build your intuition is simply returning to listening to it and tuning in, like how you are. Over time, as you listen to your intuition and build up that connection, you will build trust with it and feel it. Intuition is always a silent, neutral voice, it is never the voice of chaos. Hope this helps anyone"
0,"Okay - normally I don't ever comment on videos but since this speaks to my life experience *shrug*. 

1. I am currently a tarot reader (on the side) I charge pay what you can with a minimum of $5. $500 is insane! 

2. Opening up intuition is really just not being afraid to lean in and get things completely wrong - when I was first nervous going into this, I would drink some wine (2/3 glasses nothing crazy) and it would really help me relax and listen to my instincts on the people around me. It helped me learn to trust my gut and to just take a shot at communicating my feelings about what I am picking up on others. It is always right so I guess it's working. Going in with intentionality, trying to sit with the vibes you are picking up on, and a couple glasses of wine."
0,Consistent journaling! That's really helped me clock in to my instincts/intuition
0,Holy shit guys the Venmo ads on Brittany’s videos didn’t go away. Just hers. They persist.
0,23:51 listen the newer show (and just like that) is DIFFERENT- it’s like any new age sequel where it feels a little unusual because they are trying to make it very 2020s as far as socio- political plot lines and character additions. HOWEVER if you love sex and the city and the characters then it’s still worth watching and fun to watch. I also think you’ll love that it’s focus on them being even older. I like seeing that perspective.
0,“I give everyone around me way more credit than I give myself” SO real I’m working on this in myself right now!!! I don’t validate my own feelings so I rely on others to do it for my reassurance 😢
0,"I'm not of the supernatural type but I can tell you the more intelligent and mentally capable you are, the scarier it is to grasp the absurd massive-ness of the world. Anxiety is sure to follow; no idea how to help with it but maybe that thought is enlightening."
0,"Im sick and tired of defending her on tiktok, it was so brutal 😭"
1,Your mom is so interesting! Every time she's on I'm locked in listening.
0,Pentecostals also have exorcisms and Islam has a version as well so I would assume they have similar protection prayers to Catholics
0,If you want to be more intuitive I know it’s very common but meditating with some incense is a big help I think taking time to even if you are starting out if a guided meditation helps to guide you through it is a big help
0,Brittany I don't know if you'll see this but I've had a really hard year and been battling with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Your podcast has been the only thing that has consistently brought a smile to my face and helped me through the bad moments. I just want to thank you for making this stupid funny and at times incoherent podcast every week. I always have something to look forward to. ❤
0,the thing with the sage is that you can’t use white sage because it is indeed used by native americans and is closed practice for them! using it when not a native american is cultural appropriation
1,"As soon as she said ""what's that thing called mom?"" I was like yeah let's go ahead and call mama Broski. 😂 I loved that paranormal info video she did with her a while back. I love that shit!! It's sooo interesting! Also, there's no way I would EVER go near a ouija board nor be around people who have one or intend to use one. I'd be out of there sooo fast! 😂😂 That is VERY different from tarot cards to me personally."

3,"Brit mama- I went through this when I was 28-29 and it was HARD. You value others opinions before your own. I had to cut certain relationships to learn to trust myself FIRST and who wasn’t healthy for my mind/soul. Don’t be too hard on yourself, this is the time for you to learn.  I’m 34 now and I’m telling you doin that work is hard, but if you make the tough decision to distance the people who you jump to call before you sit with your own opinion first- this is a necessary work/exercise to trust yourself. 
I tried to find what I was looking for in healing through spirituality before working on myself. 

After doing the work-  I can happily say, your anxiety will calm, and you will trust yourself and dive into spirituality on your own terms. You are at the age of this lesson, so give yourself grace to learn in your own way, on your timeline. But anxiety, is a way of telling you to listennnnnn up baby. Listen to your body, your intuition, your GUT. You most likely will need to set boundaries with loved ones/friends for this growth. Be patient and kind to yourself. xx"
0,My coworker had this nasty bite scar on her arm. It looked MANGLED. Like I was thinking it was a shark attack from childhood or something. Finally worked up the courage to ask her what happened… it was a llama bite. It tore her ass up 😂😂😂 I couldn’t BELIEVE it!
3,"I love your mom, I'm all about the paranormal literally my favorite thing to watch, please have her more often lol"
131,"This beautiful woman has been the one person getting me through since November.  The people on TikTok are so annoying.. She has been the rock for me and hopefully many others as we've been traversing this craziness. I've cried with her, happy tears, sad tears, and I've happily laughed so much. She is not being ignorant to the problems, she is educating us on world events in the past, and making sure we're knowledgeable about everything.  Amazing work, supreme leader Broski."
0,"OMG, am I the ONLY person on planet earth that did not like Aidan and thought he and Carrie were totally wrong for each other??? Aiden tried to change Carrie constantly, from the moment they met and he made her quit smoking???  To be fair, I didn't like any of the other guys either lol, but Aiden was rigid in a way that Carrie wasn't and he always made her feel like she was ""too much"" for him. ANYWAY...wasn't a fan hahaha"

0,"double ""c"" makes a ""ch"" sound. at least in my Italian last name.. Riccio (Rich-io) where people usually say ""Ricky-o"". lol hope that helps."
1,"Broski Nazione in Italiaaaa 🇮🇹 , if the c is followed by any consonant or “a,” “o” or “u” it’s pronounced with a hard “c” so like in “cat.” Instead, if it’s followed by “i” or “e” it’s pronounced with a soft “c” like in “cherry.” 

Double consonants instead, require a longer pause than single consonants. For example the double “p” in “cappelli” = hats requires a longer pause or emphasis on the “pp” while “capelli” = hair has a quicker pause on the “p.” Native Italian speakers can hear it super easily but it’s hard for non natives."

0,I love you you re the best
0,"woowoo bitch here !! intuition is trust that you feel and know. and like most things “woowoo” it’s not a step your toe into it thing. so best thing and best advice to be connected and be in tune with energy is to also trust yourself. to be connected and divine is to also know the message and feeling you felt is sure and true. like trusting yourself your intuition is the same. practice it, the same way we practice saying no as people pleasers trust that you feel something off or wrong and practice trusting that feeling and stepping away or into something new. woowoo is basically therapy with energy. you have to practice and try and trust, it takes time but you become whole."

EDIT: SPEAKING OF POSSESSIONS!!!!! I dead ass had a dream last night I told anyone at work that would listen! I was in a club and this chick is having a possessive episode I guess? As she starts to get exorcised I try to nope out of there and start heading upstairs where I assume the exit is. I hit the first door to my right and it’s another room with a burning cross…. I kept telling people because this is the first time I’ve ever had a dream like this. I also don’t like horror movies so I haven’t watched anything that could trigger such a dream. I’m never thinking about this kind of stuff BUT I have been reading a book about witch craft and how to practice for the first time in my life. Take from that what you will miss broski 🫡💖"
1,You feel more seen out side of Abraham religion is bc Christians in America and most church’s are awful and we rely to much on each other when we should lean on the Lord. But I feel you I was raised by mostly pagan wicken then I got into Christianity and then went back to wicken but I came back to God bc i realized I should rely on him and not others
0,"Yes, speaking things into existence works, but it really depends around the energy. You’re speaking it into because you could be around people who you think want the best for you but really can despise you and once you set those things out and people know about them or things that are negative that you can’t see know about them. Those people or things can also now battle against it it’s different when you have it to yourself in your head and you’re speaking to existence in your head to yourself."
2,"Brittany... The universe doesnt provide. God does and you know it. ""Consider how the wildflowers grow"" Luke 12:27. Love your content and have for years... And will continue to  Im glad youre exploring different spiritual gateways but please stop messing with the occult by giving the enemy an access to your protection. You know the Holy Spirit is within you and it ever so gently and patiently is waiting for you to return. Please dont let the protestant ideology sever your salavation and communion with Christ. Much love funny girl!! Christ aint never left you, you know He'll come back for the one."
5,The people that are calling her out for not speaking don’t realize how many of these episodes she backlogs when she’s in a busy season. She was just at the premiere of the live action HTTYD and is constantly traveling. If you “blocked her” and don’t keep up with her of course you’d think she doesn’t talk about important issues enough.

0,"Stay the fuck away from Ouija boards, ffs!"
1,"Y'all do know she’s not an actual newscaster or politician right? I love Brittany but her job is to make jokes and be unhinged online. If y'all are so desperate for some social justice why don’t you take it to people who can actually make a notable difference. Brittany doesn’t have a responsibility to speak on anything at all and her bringing any political topic up is frankly just shouting into an echo chamber of her audience who all likely share similar morals and ideals as her and honestly is just virtue signaling so the bullies online who don’t actually follow her won’t come after her with their pitchforks. Yes, it’s a small thing to mention what’s going on and link related organizations etc, but if you care enough in the first place then you should be able to google that for yourself, and influencers shouldn’t be penalized or bullied for not being political correspondents. This is one topic that I agree with the sentiment”log off- go touch grass.” Call your senators and lawmakers if you’re that bothered otherwise you’re just seeking empty optics."

0,"Woowoo bitch here. To help with your intuition you need to lean into that feeling you described in the beginning where you took an edible and cried about the miracles of nature! I am NOT saying do edibles, I am saying integrate that feeling of appreciation for the natural cycles into your daily life! Hope that helps, love u broski!!"

0,59:16 omg my mom believes this exact same thing
0,"To do your intuition kegels just try your best to do a couple daily check-ins, take a few measured breaths, shift your weight, relax your shoulders and try to quiet the monkeys for a bit. Keep the chatter down and the tuition will seep up through the cracks. careful with sage and salt you can scatter positive energy by mistake and even trap entities which they dont love.

i had a terrifying series of experiences as a result of being careless with a ouija board that turned me from an atheist into a believer. absolutely not a toy. You should watch The Dead Files. Best paranormal investigation show ever."
0,"Alos, yes supreme lady, I also am connected to the spiritual world and have been told my intuition is very strong. I feel a weird pressure on my chest/heart area that is similar to anxiety, but it's different. I feel that pressure when a place has spirits, or when my intuition is telling me something. People could argue that I have had a lot of coincidences in my life, but bro... I have had too many that it has to be real, at least to me. Someone plz help baby spirituals like me and Brittany lol"

0,"Let’s go through your spiritual questions-
How to be more intuitive and connect with yourself-mindfulness is great. It’s always good to unplug and just get grounded in whatever space you are in. I carry around howlite (a mostly white with black lightening type stripes through it) to help channel and focus on Intuition. I highly recommend getting an oracle deck to start out. It’s easy to pull a card each day. Remember to unplug and center yourself. Shuffle through the cards while holding in your mind what you are looking for. I mostly use them for what my day may look like. Tarot is also a great option, I prefer three card pull. I usually shuffle my deck and have the person im reading for split the deck a couple of times and let me know when they are ready. I pull the cards and interpret. For example “I’m having an issue in my life”. I would pull a card defining why the issue is happening, next card what to do, and final card what could happen if the person doesn’t. The best way to approach all of this is to gauge how much you want to interact and practice divination. I consider myself a divination witch and my focus is mostly getting in-tuned with myself. I’m a millennial and am on my phone, binge watching YouTube but I still take 10-15 minutes a day to center myself. I personally don’t pull cards for people when I’m emotional because I’ve seen times where my ability to read them is clouded or I’m not interested. I do it for me, not for work."
0,SUPREME LEADER you need to look into the oxford university press “a very short introduction” series!!!! there’s like 700+ mini books to give you a basic lesson or background on literally any topic you could ever imagine!! i feel like you’d appreciate the random knowledge/hyperfixation

1,"There is an amazing audiobook called Listening in the Dark: Women Reclaiming the Power of Intuition. Each chapter is an essay by a different well known author. I couldn't recommend it enough. Another way I have gotten in touch with my feminine intuition is pulling 1 tarot card each day, either at the beginning of the day to connect to a theme for my day or at the end to reflect. I'm an artist and it has become a ritual I can't go without now. Hope this helps, best of luck!"

Yes, there are a number of herbs you could gather for a bath, tea, to burn, etc to also foster intuition. Lavender, mugwort, rosemary are good ones. Blessed be!"

15,3:08 I read the entirety of Dune on a hammock outside in spring with some berries off eddies and MANNN was it the most spiritual experience ever
3,There’s not much you can do to improve your intuition as far as ritual wise. It’s all in you. You have to train yourself to differentiate intuition and anxiety. Intuition feels like just knowing. You can build that trust by forcing yourself to go with the first thought that pops in your head when you ask yourself something. Using discernment of course. You’ll begin to see synchronicities and signs that will confirm you are on the right path which will reinforce your trust in your intuition. Keep in mind that mistakes will be made but it’s part of the process. Don’t let it discourage you.
2,"as a woo woo girlie, look up what ur leg symptoms may be associated with spiritually. guessing its probably your inner resistance manifesting physically. do the same with the gall bladder and stomach issue - your body is telling you something. 

i bet as you connect more to your intuition and inner knowing you will see some of the symptoms start to resolve!"

2,"When I was getting into Tarot and intuitive things, I read that you have to exercise your intuition like a muscle! Meditation helps, and if you get Tarot Cards, you can practice using them by drawing three cards (past, present, future), keeping them face down until the next day. When you flip them over, see if they successfully “predicted” your day! When I did that, it was crazily accurate! It also helped me learn what each card meant"
1,"Girl, Italian here.
The double letters in Italian are simply a longer and more lasting sound.
C and G change sound: 
If followed by the vowels E and I they have a soft sound so Ci in Italian is read Chi like CH in English.
If followed by the vowels A, O and U they have a hard sound, to have a hard sound with E and I you put H, so Chi in Italian is read Ki. Baci."

58,"As a woo woo witchy tarot reader- I realized my intuition is stronger at certain points in my life. When it’s not as strong I just gotta focus on the steps in front of me. When it’s strong-I feel like I’m in that quiet confident inner knowing era. But yeah I’ve been struggling recently, but it’s because I’m realizing my mental health needs to be tended to. Or even taking care of myself more, resting more, doing things that I love more. It really just depends on what you feel like is right to do for you in the moment."
13,"I had an older sister who practiced witchcraft/wicca/ect and was an artist. She exposed me to a lot of different spiritualities and always encouraged me to pull from different views and create your own magic. I also have a friend who is atheist, but his mother is a witch and he respects her views and supports her. He says she has symbols from ALL religions hung up all over the house and when he asks her why she has it (for example, a Chinese cat or a Buddha) if that’s not what she practices. She says “It’s for protection! 😊” and I think that’s really cool."

0,"A lot of the things going on with you sounds like my moms 30s she has fibromayalgia and adhd. Adhd will take a physical toll on your body eventually because of low dopamine and many other things that go along with it. My mom had her gall bladder removed emergency surgery, i almost had to have mine removed in my late 20s but i worked hard on nutrition to fix it. Havent had an attack of sciatica, leg cramps restless legs, or gall bladder or pcos in years. Low carb helps me the most, not about weight at all, just about what my body needs and absorbs the best. Everyone is different and its not all fixed by supplements and nutrition but it certainly helps a ton. A holistic nutritionist might be a good idea along with the drs you are already seeing"
7,"Brittany - you need to read Women Who Run With the Wolves. 
It’s studying the Wild Woman archetype in myths, legends and fairytales. Spoiler… every woman has the wild woman inside her… and the wild woman is your intuition.

Witch here, smudging with white sage is a closed practice, which means that if you're not native american you shouldn't do it, I personally use plants that I've found around my area and dried myself!!

It's the energy put into it that plant (ie. the love and laughter the plants hear from your window) are what cleanse the space :) Lavender and cedar are great options I use a lot"

So, intuition: is literally as simple as believing thoughts that are positive. Siting still with yourself, don't try to meditate, just sit quietly, ask yourself a question. The first answer you receive on your noggin is usually the truest. 

I'm a Seer of over 30 years.  I'd read you for free. But my specialty is dead people, and you are definitely NOT dead. Love you, beautiful!

Edit: the catholics stole all rituals from pagans they were trying to convert. So, outside of cultural or Indigenous practice, it's all open to us. The Universe really doesn't care how we commune, they just want us to commune."

Being a native Mexican to Texas I always loved your content and was a little sad to see you not post on your bigger platforms about ICE. But VannilaMace did and I ended up falling in love with her a little more. It's ok to admit you might have been wrong or maybe that you were too scared to speak up about it. But in times like these POC need advocates to speak up for them since no one else will listen to their plights. I understand it might not be something you personally relate to, albeit I was still a little disappointed. And maybe I shouldn't be? I still love your content but yeah it was a bummer..."

0,"Brittany!! Regarding connecting with your intuition, please please PLEASE read “Don’t Believe Everything you Think” by Joseph Nguyen. It’s a fantastic short self help book that is so effective at establishing what causes our emotional suffering and how we can reduce it - rely on our intuition and thoughts instead of “thinking” which is the root source of all suffering. Please check it out I really think your heart and soul could benefit from it"

You can light a candle too it really helps to go inward. I use a lot of guided meditations on YouTube to get me to a more relaxed state so I can then listen closer to my body and nervous system.

If I notice my body gets extra spasmy I stay away from caffeine that day and  take a magnesium pill before bed. Hope this helps anyone!

Ultimately, Brittney has always been vocal about her politics and attacking her is going to do nothing. You need to rally your favorite celebs who are saying NOTHING, you need to lobby your government officials, you need to protest, you need to donate, etc. etc. It is always the people who haven’t done those things that are the quickest to bully others for not doing them either. Again, ultimately Brittney is not the person you guys want to be attacking here. Props to her for taking the initiative and donating/consistently talking about issues."

1,As an ex Christian myself … (did way too much research and asked toooo many questions during COVID LOL) anyway no longer Christian but still working my way through UN- indoctrinating myself … I felt called to see a psychic the day of my grandfathers funeral. I was also scared. Actually went then left and went back and told the lady my background and I was nervous. She told me many things but the most surprising was that she sees I am a powerful speaker and about four weeks later I was asked to speak for a non profit I volunteer for and was asked to share my life story (foster care blah blah) anyway after speaking (still wasn’t thinking about that day with the psychic) a man came up to me and LITERALLY SAID TO ME “who taught you how to speak? You are one of the most powerful speakers I’ve heard live and in person and I would hire you CEO of my company today after hearing you speak. You have a gift.” Then it hit me what the psychic said. I don’t know what power runs this universe but I felt that deep to my core when you said whatever it is you feel connected. Me too mama. Energy can’t lie.

224,"I'm of Romani descent and wanted to say thank you for including the heritage of tarot when you speak about it! We use the cards in my family and there's always a degree of personal interpretation to not just individual cards but the meaning of certain cards together. Everyone reads differently. When I pull them sometimes I see things/feel someone else's emotions/get sensations, or get 'airdropped' thoughts. I use it less to predict (because multiple potential timelines always exist) and more to reveal what's true."
0,They can never make me hate you ❤
1,i can't understand people who believe stuff they know is wrong just because it makes them feel good. how is that supposed to satisfy anything but escapism. do you want the truth or do you want to pretend magic is real till you die?
0,The Reddit hour edit had me dead 😭😭
1,$100 for tarot!? Oh honey 🤦🏽‍♀️
0,"It’s always funny to me how people who I consider to be smart can also be so inclined to believe whatever nonsense comes with palm readings and tarot readings. I think about aliens looking at us from far away just as a big blue and green sphere but when you look closely, it’s a bunch of people talking about ghosts and energies and destiny and the future and different realms like… it was never that serious. You’re just alive in a planet and it’s hard for me to believe that there’s any sort of dimension or spiritual realm that is unreachable in a physical space but somehow real in the collective mind. Humans are just funny, I guess.😂"
0,when she said google wasn’t working it was like she said a limb had fallen off. we’re so sorry soldier🫡
8,"Silver and iron are extremely protective!! Some cheaper options might be obsidian, black onyx, and black tourmaline. Also, Amethyst for psychic protection and Tiger’s eye for money protection! 💖"
0,"Brit, Whatever you do, DO NOT watch the sequel to Sex and the City, ""And Just Like That."" It's not AAAAWWWFUL, but it doesn't compare to the greatness of the OG whatsoever. It's less about finding a good partner and more about being relatable to modern times. It's just... underwhelming."
0,"Omg pls watch practical magic w sandy b and madam nicole Kidman. So amazingly witchy, I think you would love! It’s based on and around womanhood, it feels so safe and feminine and strong. Pls watch!"
51,Everyone telling her she has a responsibility and will see the beginning of this and never be satisfied. I think people need to worry about themselves and their own responsibility. Its truly ridiculous to tell someone else what they have to do when you could just do your own thing and stop wasting your breath
0,"34:52 apparently theres places that can take a pic of your aura,i saw chrissy harless' video about it about a week ago you should definitely look into it ;)"
1,A Llama fucking spit in my mouth at a petting zoo once because it seduced me into thinking it wanted a lil kiss and right when I was about to-WHAM. Right in my mouth.
0,what a joy it is listening to a new broski report episode while getting ready for my uni graduation ceremony 😌🫶🏻 thank you supreme leader!!!!
3,"Hi Brittany! Practicing witch here  and fellow Texan just wanted to let you know that you have a ton of energies blocking your clarity. And if you were interested in tarot, just know that you have to be very clear minded to be able to hear the messages spirit is sending. I believe you are anxious because of the unknown. I feel like you have to have answers to things and there are so many unanswered questions in your life right now. And I know as a Texan girl we don’t have too much patience lol, But you have to trust that God will take care of you and that whatever is going to happen is meant for you🙏🏽once you trust that guidance, Life will be a lot more fun!"
0,"Note on intuition: you need to find your means of meditation. I have ADHD and I can’t focus or meditate “traditionally” for the life of me. I also give into panic and that clouds a lot. Hence the importance of meditation and giving yourself a break. You’ll figure out what cues mean what and how your intuition speaks to you. My take on Traditional eastern yoga works for me ( i dance and visualize removing blockages then flow into stretching/ yoga poses allowing the energy of a desired chakra flow through me. Everything truly is as within so without, and yes speaking things into existence works. You just also have to get mind and body on the same track.  Energy flows through our body, and our nervous system and soul interprets it. Intuition is the head of the show."
1,1:12:13 clearly she watches the pod 😂😭
2,"If you’ve been following Brittany for a while, it’s pretty easy to tell where she stands on this. The way she worded the intro makes it seem like she’s signed with a network that doesn’t let her speak openly about certain things, and she had to fight just to be able to share some resources. Just a guess, but the way she kept it so controlled really says a lot."
1,"w mama broski, she knows whats up 🙂‍↕️"
0,"She's literally only speaking out about this right now because people were tearing her up so bad, if nobody did that then she wouldn't be talking about it. She would be completely silent and all of you know that deep down. A lot of you were saying things about her instagram, but I don't see anything on there that has to do with this situation. She only ever advocates when it's convenient for her, and she waits to hear everyone's opinion so that she can take the side that will ruin her reputation less. I used to really love her but this is not okay. She literally lives in La she could be out there protesting WITH US"
2,these comments are making me thankful i don't have tiktok anymore
25,I treat her like she’s the damn Oracle at Delphi.
1,you trying not to laugh while your mom is talking has me pissing myself on the couch. “she’s an insane woman” 😭
1,The Reddit Hour intro will become a new vocal stim for me. Thank you for your service.
223,Her parents are so interesting. I loved getting to hear her mom's insight and even more cool that she's been able to have both of her parents on the show discussing things they're experts in.
1,"I love you Brittany, thank you for being an ally for all ostracized people🤍"
7,"37:15 Woowoo girl here LMAO, listen to 741hz music to awaken intuition <3"

7,what’s insane is i JUST had the same life is symmetrical/cyclical freak out. we always have the same freak outs at the same time so my parasocial relationship with you is strengthened❤
0,"BTW July 10th is a Thursday, both your lucky number & day"
0,"34:12 I fell from STANDING  on top of monkey bars when i was 12 directly onto my tailbone,the school nor my parents took me to the hospital(it was the 90s lol)they just said they wont do anything for you but give you a donut pillow to sit on(i probably needed it)Flash forward to when im 18ish and i started to feel pain in my foot like someone poured boiling water on my foot/in my veins(the skin was super sensitive and then it spread.I thought there was just something wrong with my legs and didnt have insurance so i just lived with it.When i got pregnant it became clear there was something wrong with my Back.There was extreme pain shooting down my leg. Doctor says baby is probably on a nerve etc..flash forward again to me a couple years later crawling across the floor to go to the bathroom in the morning because i couldnt walk and an MRI was done,doctors surgeons etc (i have an extremely large protruding/herniated disc/s)and i was legally disabled by 28.Leg pain IS back pain,and back pain IS leg pain for me.Sciatica and not being able to use/move your legs sucks and i hope it never escalates for you as it did with me.Stretching and exercise helps keep it at bay but once it hurts theres not alot you can do but wait for it to stop."
0,Try chiropractic!!! We specialize in the nervous system and the musculoskeletal system. It’s going to change your life for the better!!!!
1,"Notice how the only people under immense social pressure to be the perfect activist are women. Women must be the perfect advocate for everything or else, men have not faced a fraction of the backlash. It’s internalized misogyny. The youngest half of Gen Z has shifted to conservatism,  think about how every female artist that has come up in the last 5 years has been “cancelled” every month for existing. Trying to cancel Sabrina Carpenter was the last nail in the coffin for me, the youngest adults today are leaning to 50s lobotomized nuclear family misogyny."
2,"12:01 my cousin got spit on my llamas when we were kids bc he was throwing rocks at them, his reaction was hilarious 😂"
1,Don't play the ouija board
15,"Wow I have never resonated with something more when you are talking about being disconnected from your intuition. I honestly haven’t even been able to bring my feelings to words and you nailed it. Thank you for sharing❤ I feel seen, understood, and not alone."

0,I personally like the second Sex and the City TV show. But it's definitely different from the original
11,I went through something very similar with my anxiety and legs not long ago. I got a ton of scans and nothing appeared to be wrong— it turned out that my anxiety was manifesting psychosomatically through leg pain. Once I saw a somatic therapist to treat anxiety my leg pain went away. I also quit weed and went through the same journey of reconnecting with my intuition. In the end it was the anxiety and reconnecting with my body that I had to address which was super annoying but it was the thing that finally worked to heal my leg pain

Brittany is the LAST influencer people should be calling out. She is always speaking up on things no one else is talking about!!!! It’s so clear these people don’t even consume her content. Love you Brittany!!!

1,have been in bed since morning because cramps have been KILLING me. this is the perfect distraction
1,"woowoo girly here, get into meditation my love. itll help with anxiety, overthinking, clarity, etc and it'll help connect you with your higher self, all of which helps with listening to and improving your intuition. theres guided meditations, frequencies, etc to help as you do it (or you can do with silence). Just do it atleast 10mins everyday and it'll get easier as you go along and you can go longer if you want or need. its not something that'll happen immediately, it's a process that takes time. Just take it slow and try to be consistent

theres also sm other stuff to get into like — shadow work, internalized beliefs, etc etc — but i think for rn just start w meditation and look into other stuff when youre comfortable 🙂‍↕️ @broskireport"

6,"I think the way Orwell parallels his dystpoias with real life is also why I love One Piece even though I normally don’t like anime like that. The way Oda pulls real history into his story to explore the world is amazing. Like holy shit, this anime is showing people starving because the military is withholding food and the very next scene is one of the high ranking military officers complaining that nobody trusts the government while he’s eating! There’s human trafficking and history is being erased by the world government!  They destroyed an entire country for researching and chronicling the history they’re erasing! I’m nauseous and I love it!! One Piece doesn’t always hit but it is still SO tea, anyone reading this needs to give it a shot fr"

She’s my favorite person in the entire world and I still love and respect every view point she’ll ever have"
0,Girl put the edibles down before you legit go into the drug induced psychosis. When you keep doing them despite being anxious and worried you’ll ruin weed forever and worse your brain in general.
0,This is my very first episode of your podcast
0,"Girl I know its good to giggle about it but myself and a few others are a lil concerned about the anxiety in your life.

0,"Bro, I swear there’s somethin abt helicopters when ur on to something (one is right near my house rn while I’m writing this)"
1,"Britany I know you’ve been hurt by religion and the church, and I’m so sorry for that. But please, I was listening to this and my heart goes out to you because you absolutely can come back to Christianity. I experienced the same things while I was deep into new age practices that dang near gave me actual psychosis. I got saved a year and a half ago by Jesus and he’s calling for you girl. I did not grow up in the church so I don’t have that shame filled religious background but please don’t let that skew who Jesus is!! Please don’t ignore the way you feel. Also I’m not preaching religion and a rule book, but please turn to Jesus. Tarot cards and drugs and all that stuff severely mentally affected me over time. At first it’s fun and cool until it’s not - it’s not from God and it opens spiritual doors. Just like God and goodness is real so is Evil and darkness and the stuff you partake in will eat away at you without Christ. I’m praying that you’ll have a radical encounter with Jesus today and that he will speak to you. You absolutely CAN come back to Christianity and you can do it differently than how you encountered it in your youth."

0,"36:47 - there are moral dilemmas relating to science and always have been, however the unfortunate reality of our Western tech oligarchy is that the elite are funding the expansion of space technology, not because they think it’s important or because they think it’s for the greater good, but because they know they have the means to escape to another planet/space body once the technology has been created. there is no regard for the people belonging to lower socio economic groups that will be left with a doomed planet. elon, bezos and co don’t feel buoyed by moral dilemmas - the very nature of their selfishness that brought them their fortunes in the first place is all the evidence we need for that - so it’s not that moral dilemma aren’t keeping up, but that the people who have the power to do something as far as pursuing an ethical “greater good” make the decision not to for their own personal benefit anyway. I don’t think it’ll be very long until we see that the greatest tragedy of our time is when we are abandoned by those who take our money and give back an inheritance of destruction and pain. still there are people who believe that this ‘wealthy elite’, who are actively destroying the environment and are investing in technological research that facilitates their plan b, are the ones who will solve the problem. western society’s abandonment of critical thinking in favour of an anti-intellectual sentiment means that even though it’s obvious to so many people that these tech bros are trying to sell us the idea “there’s no global warming” so that they can pack their own pockets for their escape and leave everyone else to pick up the pieces, there will still be plenty of uneducated, ignorant people who continue to buy these lies without wondering why they’re being sold to them in the first place"

0,"Love your content hon! Being alone with your thoughts ALL THE TIME is not great, you gotta get out there and talk to people face to face, we're social creatures!! (redbull isn't helping tho, and if you're having issues with the edibles you gotta pick different strains or use smaller doses cause it can definitely make it Worse) ((not that a stranger's opinion on the internet should influence your lifestyle decisions drastically))
A personal opinion regarding the Area 51 has aliens thing that Will Not Help paranoia: I'm fairly convinced that the US government LOVES when we think the Unidentified Flying Objects are aliens instead of newly designed weapons of war cause it makes the majority of the public dismiss it entirely as a hoax with no follow up, keeping the military secrets out of public eye.
Not that I think aliens aren't real, or that we wouldn't absolutely just start experimenting on them, I just don't think they're here cause this space rock sucks and the universe is HUGE!!! Out of infinite possibilities, and infinite directions, I find it difficult to believe they picked the right direction to search already.
(off to watch today's upload next, sorry if you've addressed anything here already)"
1,"I would totally recommend reading the Bible again for yourself Instead of based on what people have told you in the church.

You said it yourself that people aren't perfect and they are misleading. I just feel like basing your entire belief system on what people tell you will just lead into more confusion and misunderstanding (believe me I tried)

That's why you should just try to read the bible as a peice of literature instead of as the thing that people used to have you beleive. (If that makes sense) It is full of misinterpretations because of the language barriers and times, and I promise you it is so much more ""solid"" than philosophy and other writings. If you see it as a part of history then  reread it as such and interpret it for yourself. It's not just a book of stories and rules, there are so many things to discover within it which make it so interesting and a lot more fufilling

Dont base your opinion on a religion based off of what imperfect people say about it or how they act within it. Base it off of the actual book that it is based off of. This goes for every religion and belief. I hope this makes sense :)"

0,Please god do a live studio recording
1,I was deeply hurt by the church and I complete agree that it’s full of flawed people and only God is perfect. But I still am a believer because I know how deeply rotten I am to my core and that I need forgiveness. I also believe God loves all including the people the church discriminates against - as a queer person it’s important to me to follow the truth of the gospel. Jesus didn’t preach to hate and judge. He said “love God and love others” are the two most important commandments. Anyway that’s where I’m at now. Plus I can’t believe there’s nothing spiritual happening. There’s definitely more to life than what the eye can see. ❤

That we must surrender, when the odds of being on this Earth can only be a blessing; and yes circumstances beyond our control affect how we become ourselves, and our actions, and so forth, but the mere damnation because we are born in sin is WILD. Nature is spirit in form and if we cannot respect nature, our nature towards others, what right do we have to the Divine?"

The best example of this is Christmas, which was originally a germanic holiday known as “Yule” to celebrate the winter solstice.

0,"Religious Trauma is a symptom of the Church and the capitalist role it plays in civilization. When I think of Religious Trauma I don't think of CEOs or Priests, I think of working class people. Working class people are the most affected by the fear and propaganda that the Church subjugates unto people. When people work long back breaking or tiring jobs, instead of looking at the real source of this problem, the oppressive capitalists, their attention has been redirected to ""God"" and how he can save them. Work hard now so you can get into heaven after you die and a lot of people believe that's the best they're going to get. There are very little organizations offering solutions to their class based struggle and the Church is the best friend of the capitalist system because it renders people complacent to deter them from revolution. Spreading hate and bigotry in the Church is another tool that they use to divide the working class, to create fictional divides such as different beliefs, sexualities, or life styles so we cannot focus on what unites us. What unites isn't that we are humans with morals, but because we all have the same interests as workers. I'm sure most people are terrified of climate change and want it to stop and I'm sure there are scientists who are interested in recovering the planet but in the face of capitalist interests it is impossible to even start that process when the majority of waste and pollution is caused by companies and businesses. I think Science is a great tool to use to understand why the world works the way it does, not just in a physics sense but also in a sociological sense. The Church and ""God"" will never give us the answers on how to topple Capitalism and take back control of our lives, but science can."

1,"What I'll say about the anxiety you're experiencing. You may just be letting go of a build up of anxiety you had stored and hadnt processed in the past. Feelinsg will always come back up eventually if they weren't processed. If you choose to go on anxiety pills, I would warn you that theres a chance youre going to be blocking the feelings that you might need to process in order to get theough it and let it go. If you numb something and don't feel it, you cant process it. Just something to think about. You are strong enough to get through this on your own, but if you do choose to use pills to ease what youre feeling, I'd only do it for a short period of time in order to settle your mind enough to find and start practicing coping skills in order to eventually get off the meds and not need them. Thats just my opinion tho. Either way, youre going to be blocking emotions that will eventually manifest later on and youll still have to feel them or experience them one way or another."

0,The anxiety is from the edibles babe
0,"Something that really helps me with fear/anxiety about things out of my control is reading books/biographies about incredibly inspiring people who have gone through really hard times throughout history. Knowing you, I think this might help you as well. 

Some examples are: The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom (WWII) or Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom by Catherine Clinton. These women were successful in their honorable missions and incredibly brave/inspiring.

I think even stories of heros who are MIA or died honorably are inspiring because they are a reminder that no matter how hard or bad that times get, there is ALWAYS something you can do for good. I won’t recommend any of these though because I love you and I think they would scare you as of now. Take care of yourself girl! :)

@BroskiReport I’m trusting one of y’all to get this message to the supreme leader if you think it might help her at all :) <3"

1,Lymph node lesson nobody asked for! The toxins in the drainage system are more like environmental allergins in your sinuses. The system will drain itself and is stimulated by exercise! You can massage the system to help it pass along.
2,"don't worry Brittany, Prometheus was freed eventually!! Hercules needed Prometheus's help for one of his 12 labours, so he decided to kill the eagle that was tasked with eating Prometheus's liver every day and freed him (with his father Zeus's permission). Prometheus, knowing he had to earn Zeus's complete forgiveness, talked him out of his infatuation with Thetis (the sea nymph who would then give birth to Achilles), warning him that if they ever had a son, he would overthrow him like Zeus did to his father Chronos, and Chronos did to his father Uranus. so Zeus married Thetis off to someone else (Peleus), and she had Achilles with him and all was well, so Zeus completely forgave Prometheus and now they're good. i like to think Prometheus is living out his retirement somewhere peaceful with no eagles in sight"

0,"34:40  -- In The words of Rhett McLaughlin semi abbreviated  ""Your kids are leaving the church because you 'trained' them well enough to develop a sense for truth and justice. .You let them read the words of Jesus; and they got it.  .......  They're not leaving because they don't know the truth. they're leaving because they do.""    I agree that organized churches do more harm than good these days. In my experience, the church i was part of didn't feel warm after a certain point. The people were cold and hateful. The lessons they taught always had self-righteous, hypocritical undertones. I could no longer see or feel the 'Christ like' love i was taught to seek out.  So I followed the love and the warm right out the door. At this point in time, I'm happy with what I've got going on in the belief system. And even though it changes all the time for me, there's little parts that are always gonna be solid so I think i'm alright living with that. :)  
This episode gave me a lot to nod my head yes too lol"

24,"Oh my god it is so validating to hear you talk about spiritual psychosis, how anxious you’ve been, and how you feel something on the horizon for June 😭 I’ve been feeling the EXACT SAME WAY 😭 and I thought I was just losing it a bit or maybe the universe was trying to teach me something about myself"

ALSO she is definitely realizing that manifestation is frfr... I love that this is the next saga of Brittany! I'm a witch and spiritualist and I'm obsessed with thisssss
1,I’ve been to “Area 51” twice now as a biologist. It’s owned by both the DOD and DOE and is a test site for weapons testing but also energy projects and nuclear projects. I needed to send information about myself ahead of time and it required me to have a “sponsor” with me at all times. We were not allowed to have phones or any kind of radio equipment. Once you get through the gate we drove for probably 40 mins just to get to the building we were briefed in. It’s a massive area. One of my favorite towns close to the site is Beatty NV! It’s such a cute town. That’s all I can really say
0,"Brittany, I highly recommend that you stop smoking weed altogether. The things youre saying sounds a lot like how my thoughts were when I was a heavy smoker a few years ago. In fact, I had a pretty bad psychosis episode from an edible, and it was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. I believed so many weird things, that people were out to kill me, that i needed to run away somewhere, etc. There were points where I lost full control of my body. In those moments where I blacked out, based on what my peers told me, I'm pretty sure i was possessed. 

I wont go into the crazy details, but truly, it was by God's grace that i was protected from hurting myself or anyone else. I was placed in a hospital and from there, to a psych ward. It was in the psych ward that i was told cannabis use was the cause of my psychosis, which is something i had never even heard of before! The counselor i spoke to said that she was seeing more and more cases of young adults like me experiencing a psychosis episode due to cannabis use. Since then, my mind was changed and I couldnt even smell weed without having a panic attack. It took years of therapy and coming back to Christ for me to get back to 'normal' mentally. 

So please, take this seriously. Weed is not just some fun drug. There's still so much research to be done on how THC affects the brain and there are TONS of drug-induced psychosis cases like mine that people arent talking about."

1,19:20 you should watch the show Kaos! It’s about Greek mythology in modern times and Prometheus narrates it!
1,"Girl I think you need the song “The Prophecy” by Taylor Swift. This year, from like the end of April to the end of May I had such bad anxiety, like more than my normal levels, like my heart was beating at 140-160 range for no reason, for HOURS, because I was so stressed out. I was praying for a way out, and was willing to do anything to stop the pain. This song helped me get out of the plague, as I like to call it, of anxiety, and have understanding within myself. In the song, Taylor speaks about how she’d give it all up, her last coin, just for someone to tell her that her misery isn’t forever. It really held onto me strong during my plague and helped me wriggle out of the grasps of my anxiety."

The fact that they made you feel safe enough to ask questions, didn't make you feel like a nuisance or shameful. Just sat there and probably answered every question until you grew up to be this passionate adult that loved to learn. I bet your dad feels very special whenever you think to call him about random things :') I also love to spout random facts to my mom and sometimes feel like a blabbermouth.

1,"A lot of people here commenting on THC being the reason for her anxiety, and while I agree it’s probably a contributing factor (THC also gives me intense anxiety and paranoia, regardless of strain or how I take it, and I know many who say the same), I think that her caffeine intake needs to be part of the discussion if we’re going to be guessing at the cause lol. My ex husband used to drink a pot of coffee, five Rockstars, and then a second pot of coffee in a day, and was misdiagnosed with Paranoid Personality Disorder. Guess how his anxiety is now that he cut down on caffeine… yeah this is anecdotal, but there’s so many studies about caffeine contributing to anxiety, particularly when consumed in high volume. I’m not supposed to take my particular anxiety meds and then have caffeine because it can counteract the anxiety reducing effects 🤷🏻"

0,"I am Catholic and I believe that the church and religion does have moral guideposts, but people don’t follow them. They buck against the dogma bc they don’t like rules. But rules guide your morals. In Catholicism, the guideposts were left by Jesus to Peter, who was the first Pope who formed the church. In any other Christian religion, the rules are made by church leaders and they’re all different. I could see why you find unrest in that considering what religion you grew up in. Catholicism is a solid faith and has a solid framework to lean on: Jesus and his teachings."

1,"President Broski, as a current member of the USAF who is stationed at Nellis AFB in Las Vegas, I can tell you that Area 51 is a part of Nellis AFB. 
Though it is not referred to as Area 51, but rather the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) due to Area 51 being within the range.
As the name suggests the NTTR is where we test new aircraft and munitions. 
Edwards AFB, being as close as it is, also works within the NTTR. 
All to say, Area 51 is a military testing facility and sightings of whatever we got cooking up could easily be mistaken as UFOs to the general populace."

2,"And unfortunately, your intuition was so right because something major is in fact happening in June 2025"
0,"Babygirl, I religiously watch you every single week to the point where I’ve accidentally referred to you as my friend when recalling something you said… I say this with love and complete understanding: you gotta stop doing edibles. I quit smoking weed in January and I would smoke multiple times a day for 3 years and the mental clarity and lack of anxiety was so healing… I was in the exact place that you are right now: full of anxiety and no clue how to fix it… I love you so much and I think stopping smoking and maybe a tad of anxiety medication would really put you at ease. I love you so so much and I never comment on things but I just had to tell you because maybe, just maybe, you will see this and know that someone out there was in your exact position only a couple months ago and I can already tell you that the anxiety lessens! Ik we self medicate with weed for anxiety but it’s making it worse! At a certain point of excessive usage and it makes your anxiety so so much worse. Anyways I love you and you have taught me so much and I’ve finally picked up reading instead of scrolling entirely because of you 🩵🩵🩵🩵 you’re so water nymph coded baby"
0,I live in Tok Alaska and had to drive 4 hours to Fairbanks yesterday and saw 4 moose on the drive 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0,"omg brittany get INTOOOOO gustave dore. you will be OBSESSED (idk if you go look as the pod goes on im only halfway through but i dont PLAY BOUT THE MF GUSTAVE DORE!!) also the ""humankind yearns to be more"" line IS ITTTT!! its actually helped relieve a lot of the same anxieties ive been having as you. to realize so much of our problems come from the ego, and the raw human need to be centered at all times."

0,Watching this episode while sitting outside touching grass
0,"35:39 i went to a lutheran university as someone who struggled with organized religion and my spirituality. i had a professor, Dr. Schultz, who i would stay after class to just pick his brain cuz he was so cool and smart (he was anthropologist). and sometimes i would pick his brain about religion and he told me something that changed my whole view and i say this to anyone who asks me “what i am” when it comes to religion. he would always say “im not a christian. i’m a believer in Christ” meaning that the church as an organized entity and all their corrupt doing had no effect on him bc he doesn’t believe in the church … he believes in Christ and His teachings. and that is how i’ve changed my view on things. Dr. Schultz you will always be famous to me and you’re one of the best people i ever met. I hope he is resting in peace and love 🤍 we miss you down here"
0,i’m sorry not a great tarot reading tbh
0,"hey! i know we usually take things lightheartedly, but i wanted to comment about the spiritual psychosis part of the episode because maybe it could help either you, brittany, or anyone else reading who’s going through something similar.

coming from a psychologist student who’s also kind of spiritual (i believe in energies, practice some light “craft”, and i am also ex-catholic): you’re not wrong to say things feel off in the universe. they are. we, as a society and as a species, are going through a lot, from war to climate change. it’s scary, and it does make an impact on all of us, wether we’re glued to the news or avoiding information for our own sanity. 

i’d say going back to the church isn’t an option, given your experience and the current overall situation. getting your palm read isn’t silly or dumb, at the end of the day it’s another resource you have to make yourself feel better! that’s totally okay.

im not sure if you’re currently in therapy, but i’d suggest trying out one if you aren’t—sounds like you might need some guidance with the anxiety situation, a therapist is a great way to start if that’s something you’re interested in.

lastly, stay safe! edibles are fun, but please keep your health and wellbeing in mind :] we love u !♡︎"
0,girl you aint never heard primeval? whatttt
1,Okay for the people that are trash talking Brit rn about her politics. Are the same ppl that beg for Jenna to come back but would bash her if she decided to be a toothbrush and not talk politics. Like GOD FORBID A GIRL can have a hobby aside from politics.

0,CRYPTID OF THE WEEK YESSSSS
0,So basically Prometheus is Enki from the Annunaki
3,"Some fair criticism for this episode:

I find it quite tone deaf considering was is going on in the country, more specifically LA. At the beginning you talk about how “something is going on in June” and how you feel you might be getting “hunted for sport” as a joke, while thousands of ppl are actually being hunted for sport, yet you make no mention of that throughout the episode. You complain about the helicopter noise you hear at 4:49, while that chopper might be hunting someone in actuality. 
You speak of chick fil a, giving them free advertisement, saying how you dont care they’re a christian company. Meaning you dont care of the damage they do to the gay and trans community. If you love that place and put your ethics aside to continue to eat it, do so in private. No need to advertise them.
On that same breath, you also praise justin timberlake. 
Saying all this only bc you are allegedly woke. So lets keep it woke?"
3,"girl, I usually love your podcasts but this one made me real anxious, I'm sorry 😭"
2,"girl, the way you talk about your anxiety is exactly how i felt a year ago (i just turned 28). i got put on lexapro and i feel like myself again and didn’t realize how much anxiety was taking over my brain until it wasn’t. i would talk about it with your therapist!! it’s changed my life"
0,My papa was a no bs kind of man in the air force and worked on planes for Locke Martin and he got stationed near Area 51 and had to go in a few times for them to work on planes and he would tell my mom that he saw aircraft’s with technology they had never even heard or seen before sooooo

1,"June 14th is when Trump is throwing a ""parade"" full of half the U.S. arsenal and military tanks and says any protesters will be met with a ""deadly force"". When Brittany says she thinks something might happen that will change the Earth in June. It has something to do with what's happening to this country. That's just my opinion."

Also I had an actually bad addiction to Weed and THC  until a year ago and it started making my depression anxiety meds less effective (no shit I realize that now). I had paranoia, crippling sadness and almost had to go to a place to be held to get immediate medication adjustments that usually take months. Anyways, if you’re in that area of starting to get bad emotions from weed, I STRONGLY implore you Brittany please stop. At the very least take a break."

0,"It’s hard to sympathize with her saying she doesn’t think churches in 2025 could lead people out of darkness and whatever the whole spiel, she said about that and it’s kinda  naïve because she’s not currently practicing she doesn’t follow a religion per se so she doesn’t know what’s actually happening in these small churches she’s not seeing the people who are going to Third World countries that are being murdered for being Christian when they’re just trying to help a tribe that doesn’t even know that English is even a language she’s not seeing the thousands of people every week going to shelters and how much money that churches are putting into schools to help arts and sports or even seeing the new wave of followers of Jesus that are no longer subscribing to a religion that are no longer putting themselves in a box of a denomination to listen to someone who deemed themselves a higher power or more knowledgeable, but rather forming their own relationship with Christ and doing their own research in their own teachings to help them through their day-to-day rather than relying on a pope or a priest."

0,"Girl its okay to go back to Christianity, I've wanted to comment something like this for a while because Ive struggled with thinking I know everything, the world is going to die and I'm the only one who sees it, I feel hopeless. Its horrible. But those are the moment I'm furthest from God. I won't say anymore to try to win you over but it help me.❤️"
1,"I’m such a big supporter of yours but this was such a hard watch. You speak about your religious psychosis and your issues with substance and then you shift and speak about how religion is wrong and does no good but there are millions and millions of people who say others wise. I know it’s opinion based but I know you believe in god, I can tell by the way you talk about religion as if it’s not something that isn’t real to you but more so like it’s something that hurt and failed you. I love how curious you are about the world and history and religion why not go to a church and see what it is like, your older now you have a new perspective. Don’t forget you can have your own relationship with God. I don’t say this to pressure you but this is constantly a topic for you maybe it wouldn’t hurt to go to church and see where your trauma really lies with it. Don’t do yourself a disservice by being so hateful and critical because you choose to put labels on a religion. Christianity isn’t homophobic, sadly some Christians are, Christianity isn’t a republican organization, some Christians choose to vote that way. You can’t continue living a life like this it only hurts your mental more. I’m so sorry you had such a bad experience with the church I’m sorry someone misrepresented what it really means, it’s love it’s all love and I’m sorry you didn’t get that. Christianity has great lessons. The Bible has every answer you could ever need, and I mean every single answer."

Non-DoD agencies are not authorized to own property, so the closest military base “owns” the satellite site on their property records. For example, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency has a location in STL, but the closest AF base legally owns the land and facilities. W/ Edwards being the closest base, it will have the records management for the property, allegedly 🫶🏻🫶🏻"

0,"religion gives people the illusion of power. it use to help us deal with situations that we couldn’t understand, but now that we have the science to understand it all, it now serves as community. obviously there are many places where the people given power are awful, but in places that its not, it gives people peace. praying over people gives the illusion that you’ve done something to help, despite it being a situation you have no control over and that brings people a lot of peace. religion will never be for me, but i can understand how some people love their faith so deeply"

0,I swear I saw more Aimee Lou wood in this one episode of the broski report than in one episode of the white lotus
2,"Brittany I implore you to start taking CBD if not regularly for your anxiety, then at the very least in combination with your edibles. CBD/edibles that are made with a CBD blend are key in soothing anxiety associated with THC for so many cannabis patients! I’d recommend also maybe try the eddies in lower milligram or an indica variety if you haven’t already! Love u"

0,Brittany: Breath of the Broski
1,"I love this channel so much, but the 47 Venmo ads screaming at me every 2 minutes are literally making this video unwatchable"
0,"Girl the anxiety is linked to ADHD I believe. The way your brain jumps topic to topic and still running lyrics through your head can cause anxiety and a feeling of unrest. Thoughts over lapping constanly makes it hard to feel relaxed or on track. 
Speaking from experience. 
Marijuana gives me paranoia and anxiety because my brain slows down and the calm makes me feel like I’m in danger and over analyze things I’m normally zooming past."
3,"The picture of her wearing the elf ears, having a serious convo with her dad about Area 51 and Air Force knowledge while Britney being so locked tf in, got me."

496,Psych nurse here. Brittany if smoking the green is making you feel anxious and you feel like random things are somehow connected I would try and cut down on the devils lettuce. It’s sadly a slippery slope where at some point a person will not be able to recognize what is based in reality anymore and what is made up in their head.

1,Your fear of moose is valid. I’m from the Rockies and people are always surprised to hear that’s the only thing if scared of in the mountains. They aren’t afraid of humans and the only thing you can do if one is being aggressive towards you is run as fast as possible and hide 🥲😅

Wishing anyone struggling with that success on their journey 💙"
0,"Hey Brittany, first off, love you 😍 Im not too sure if you’re interested  but I’m Orthodox Christian and I’m not too sure if you have gone to one or know about it but our mission is not to make a bigger church community, it’s always a plus to have more people but our mission is to be closer to God, Jesus, and to love more. My mom used to be Catholic and her mom was Protestant, cherry picking definitely can make you feel kinda weird and question your spirituality I totally understand you! My mother met my father who is Greek Orthodox, she went to church before I was born and she was trying to find her spirituality too and she said the first time she went, she felt so much peace and love ❤️ I’m not too sure if this helps but it’s worth a try if you’re interested 😍 by the way your music is amazing and I’m so happy how much you have grown ❤️"

And for your love of Etymology : ""The word philanthropy comes from Ancient Greek φιλανθρωπία (philanthrōpía) 'love of humanity', from philo- 'to love, be fond of' and anthrōpos 'humankind, mankind'.[2] In the second century CE, Plutarch used the Greek concept of philanthrôpía to describe superior human beings.""

2,Random but do the genetic testing for antidepressants and psych meds so it’ll tell you what your body metabolizes best and you won’t have to trial and error meds for so long!!
0,"4:24 IDK when this was filmed, but seems like u predicted the ICE raids in LA."
0,When she said she was experiencing hallucinations and psychosis and then stopped to listen quietly to the sky I thought she was listening to the voices in her head and I fucking screamed
1,"O god!  If you think you have a UTI, go get checked now because I hardly noticed mine until I was vomiting, couldn’t eat, chills and flop sweats and went in finally.  Well, it became a kidney infection and a blood infection. Five days in hospital.  Ladies, don’t try to push through!  Take care of yourselves!  Plus, hope you’re okay because the whole Blackhawk down thing is happening in LA.  Everyone be safe!  Plus plus, up here in Northern Canada this past weekend we saw a moose swimming from one island to another while we were fishing.  Even from far away it was scary."
2,i really really hope you speak up about what’s happening in LA rn
6,20:32 I might be tripping but isn’t  the lighting ceremony for the Olympics supposed to represent the flame (I think it’s supposed to be an eternal flame) that Prometheus gave to humanity?
0,"I went though this and I had to forced myself to step back get away from tarot, psychic readings, all that. I had to shut that out and talk myself though stuff I was thinking too hard on. I hate to say it but I had to bring logic back."
0,Why is the Venmo ad only haunting this podcast I’m TIRED 😅
8,"watching the broski report and playing with slime, what a beautiful day in broski nation"
0,Having self awareness of spiritual psychosis but still diving deep is so relatable 🤣
1,"I know this isnt the place but this is the only place i feel welcomed... My dad might get arrested and deported due to ICE being in our area and ive never been so scared. Im 26 and live with my dad alone. his wife passed, and his older son moved because he started a family of his own. its just me and my dad and if he gets taken away ill have nothing. please wish us safety i dont know what do do anymore"
0,"I was obsessed with 20/20 experience a few years ago, randomly remembered it today and decided to listen to it again, exactly on the day you mention it on the podcast??? Broski leader is never beating the psychic allegations"
0,"It is happening but it’s okay. Spiritual stuff is happening!!!!! Recenter into your self. 
 breathe in 4 count
Hold 2 
breathe out 6 counts redo. This helps stimulate and open the consciousness and calm via the dorsal vagal nerve. Somatic healings directly affects that nerve as well. That nerve directly affects consciousness and the body’s abilities to keep it all in balance between the emotional, physical, and spiritual human being."
2,"I think a vacation and stopping edible will help. Cut back on caffeine. I had really bad anxiety after that thing with america happened. You know that thing with that guy? I went on A vacation and everything felt alright afterwards. If you went on a vacation and ate some food went on a boat and vlogged it id watch.
Or don’t vlog it if you want a deep deep vacation. 

Another thing that helps with anxiety (see a doctor of course but we dont have enough where i live) drink chamomile tea before bed. Depending on how it affects you, you could do it every night, every other night or right now i just do two nights a week cause it makes me drowsy."
1,"brittany please take care of yourself fr bc spiritual psychosis is very real and very scary. i experienced this a few years back and i never got help for it, so it lasted MONTHS. it might not feel like it’s a big deal or dangerous when you’re in it bc you feel above everything and divinely guided, but it causes so much anxiety and is genuinely so scary. pls pls pls try to stay off the eddies and cut down on the caffeine for a little while dude 😭🖤 marijuana definitely is what fueled my psychosis and i don’t want you to got through this shit"

0,"This one is threatening to fall on the side of the line of actual mania, queen. I was a bit concerned listening to the first twenty minutes... may take a step back from eddieville and the red bull! Love u 🫶"
0,"Jumping on a personal trampoline drains lymph fluid. Don't do this if you have heart problems. Also, walking is good for lymph drainage. Lymph fluid comes from plasma in your blood, it goes around your cells, collects all the excess fluids (cell debris, harmful substances),  and gets filtered by your lymph nodes. Sometimes these can get backed up, so you'll see swelling. A gentle massage in the area can help as well."
0,"I grew up Southern Baptist in the deep South. I read Angel and Demons in middle school. It hugely impacted my views that I had already been questioning for a while.

I'm not religious; I call myself spiritual. I'm fully against organized religion and evangelism, but believe in a higher power. Usually, my thoughts align with an impersonal God, a Cosmic God, a Mother Earth Goddess, a Quantum Physical (gender neutral) God.

I see math, astrophysics, biology, and generally all science/math as God. Math and science are the language of the One. the All.

I dabble in tarot, but not in a reading-the-future way. More so as a time of reflection. A crude example is like when you're trying to make a decision so you flip a coin, but while it's flipping you hope it to land a certain way and that's how you make your decision--less so on what the outcome of the coin flip tells you to do. The cards don't tell me what to do, but they show me what I'm already feeling and help me see it and process it.

I highly recommend you read The God Equation by Michio Kaku."
3,"Brittany, I’ve been watching it since the beginning and I love you and support you, but as a Mexican girl from Texas I pains me to see that with the platform you have you are not using it. I know that you have used it on instagram but really how hard is it to repost it to other platforms, at this time it is IMPERATIVE that you use the platform that you have worked so hard for, please I beg of you. With love.❤"

1,"PROMETHEUS YES! THIS IS MY SPECIAL INTEREST! For the girlies…

✨Prometheus: The Overachieving Older Brother
Name meaning: “Forethought”
Zodiac energy: Taurus-Sagittarius hybrid vibes — strategic, rebellious, loves justice
Role: Humanity’s ride-or-die
Claim to fame:
	•	Created humans (with clay!)
	•	Stole fire from the gods to help them level up
	•	Literally got tortured forever for it. Iconic behavior.

Core vibe:
Prometheus is that kid in school who actually reads the syllabus, corrects the teacher, and runs a secret hacker group for justice after class. He’s smart, thoughtful, and doesn’t flinch when it comes to going against the system.

✨Epimetheus: The Hot Mess Little Brother
Name meaning: “Afterthought”
Zodiac energy: Big Sagittarius-gemini chaos — impulsive, well-meaning, kind of a dumdum
Role: Walking red flag but in a “he means well” kind of way
Claim to fame:
	•	Accepted Pandora (the first mortal woman) as a gift from Zeus
	•	Did not question it
	•	Let her open the famous Pandora’s Box (it was actually a jar, but okay), unleashing every single bad thing into the world — pain, sickness, taxes, bad exes, etc.

Core vibe:
Epimetheus is that friend who says “what’s the worst that could happen?” right before everything bursts into flames. He’s sweet! But not a thinker.

I NEED A SHOW ABOUT THEM"

0,"I am in the architectural industry and I will say during college - specifically art history - a MAJORITY of christianity/characters in the “bible” are directly pulled from greek mythology. 

Angels are a perfect example of how mythology is recycled into the “bible”. 

Another tangent is that almost all of history’s “firsts” or “inventors” are not actually the first or creators of those ideas/creations we are taught in European/western civilization. Africa and Egyptians (also african’s) are the true creators/firsts. 

Feel free to reach out in you want to dive into more details :)"

0,"Please go to a specialist and get some anxiety medication! Even if it’s just temporary. We are all here for you and love you Brittany, there’s no judgement in getting help ❤️"
0,"Girl, marijuana is the worst for anxiety. People have this idea that it “chills you out”. It’s like taking cocaine because it makes you run faster on the treadmill. It is not a solution to any problem and often exacerbates or masks any underlying issues. 

Of course there are outliers, but statically, the majority of people using marijuana are using it irresponsibly and to the detriment of their mental health. 

Try stopping for a month or two and I can almost guarantee you that your mind will clear significantly. At the very least, you’ll be able to approach your struggles with a clear head."

0,"Shout out from a Tacoma resident :D The author of Dune is from here and we have a park dedicated to him ""Dune Penninsula"" and just found out bundy lived here as a kid as well as manson. Tacoma has some wild random history"
0,"Hey Brittany, I definitely recommend reading All Tomorrows by Nemo Ramjet (It's an E-book only btw). It takes place millions of years in the future and chronicles the world's history from colonizing Mars to the downfall of human civilization and what happened to the remaining humans after a massive galactic war. It's pretty fucked up what happens, but it literally reads like a history textbook with hand-drawn art and everything. It was released back in 2006 and it's so interesting to see how the author kind of predicted how future scientific and technological advancements could pan out  - AKA the decision to see Mars as our 'next destination'. Really good read and your segment on Area 51 had me thinking about it once again. If you don't feel like reading it then Alt Shift X has a great video about it on his channel!! Loved the episode this week :))"

41,"Finally, I can pass on some (vague but fun) Area 51 intel! I was an MC in the Navy for 7 years - essentially a journalist. My instructor for our course in autopsy photography was stationed at the Edwards Air Force Base which operates with (if not owns) Area 51, which is one VERY specific site attached to the base which you cannot access unless directly contracted. My instructor was contracted to hand-deliver classified photos to an office within this site, and while he said there wasn't much to see, they took the entire entrance process very seriously. He needed a Yankee White on top of his top secret security clearance, and along with the ""camo dudes"" there are sensors in the ground that alert the base of approaching vehicles. If I'm remembering correctly, he said they are hidden within the black cactuses on the sides of the roads! 
The site itself is a test site for newly engineered military aircraft and weapons (allegedly), which in itself is a reason to be considered top secret - but who knows what is actually going on in there. While I was in, I definitely was looking up every possible way to get stationed there lol. Shoulda joined the Air Force instead."

2,I’m on 🍄 and eating a hotdog and this is the episode I land on? I’m crying at monkfruit please what is that
0,24:00 that’s disrespectful
51,"52:00 I know this is so ""🤓"" but I wrote my diploma thesis on the habitability of planets and the Rare Earth Hypothesis and I love this topic! The idea that exactly the same circumstances exist anywhere else in the universe is incredibly unlikely, even more unIikely the chance that another lifeform would be as advanced as us and create technology, leave its planet, travel, or even live at the same time as us. (James Kasting, Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee for example have great works on this) For one, the region around a star where a planet receives the appropriate amount of stellar flux to support liquid water on its surface is incredibly small. On a larger scale, there is also something called the Galactic Habitable zone. The inner boundary is characterized by high star density and catastrophic events (magnetars, supernovae, etc.) in the center, which complicate the evolution of life. A potential habitable planet should favorably not be in that zone (and now keep in mind all the other factors). Factors such as the size, age, and type of stars are crucial for life to even be possible, plate tectonics, climate changes, greenhouse effects, the list goes on. Earth's habitability was genuinely just based on a series of coincidences (unless you are religious, amen), such as the formation of the Moon and its size (which has a stabilizing effect on the tilt of a planet's rotation axis, which prevents extreme temperature fluctuations) and the correct ""type"" of and distance from our sun. Very massive stars (O, B, A) burn out too quickly. M-type stars (red dwarfs) pose risks such as tidal locking, strong stellar winds and flares, as well as potentially lower planetary masses. F-type stars release larger amounts of UV radiation, you see where I am getting with this. The chance for microscopic-level life is generally considered higher! I believe scientific likelihood should be kept in mind"
4,"I hope everyone coming to see if she speaks on whats happening in LA - realize these episodes are filmed a week in advance - I WILL SAY - She could do what Kurtis does and when editing, add a clip of them addressing a topic that is currently happening.

0,"There's a little perspective stuff happening in that first picture, since the moose is closer to the camera than the cars and people, but yes they're huge. One time I was hiking and two black moose were just making their way down the trail (well, next to the trail, not right on it) and you just have to calmly move yourself far away from them and stand still to give them space as they go by. It was amazing, they weren't acting aggressive or weird, they were probably used to seeing humans, and they were just making their way to wherever they wanted to go, and you just have to respect them."

I love you and petition for a royal court with josh o'connor."
0,i think female reindeer have antlers??? our supreme leader is simply a deer in finland! christmas queen!!
0,Gut instinct vs actual anxiety is simply your conscious thoughts vs your subconscious thoughts which are  the scary thoughts. Everything that happens after you think it is literally BECAUSE you thought it. Man is GOD and that's what the Bible is saying. It's saying your everyday hidden and unhidden thoughts control your world. See Neville Goddard and Subconscious Loz and it'll make sense eventually. What you are is what will be the end.
1,"This is gunna sound corny, but whatever. I don't she'll find what she's looking for in church, in religion. In man. I think she needs to go to the higher up. Try Jesus. Ask, reach out to him . Not a pastor. The Source....and see how that changes things."

0,"Humans created religion and all the rules and morals contained in it, so we just need to create the rules and morals for science - which there are some. Maybe because scientists aren't afraid of hell if they do something ""wrong"" then they don't care about whether something they do in science is a ""sin,"" but humans themselves created the idea of morals, of right and wrong. It's talked about in the scientific world - the ethics of research, how you have to treat the people or things you're studying with respect, do no harm, try the best you can to not let your own biases skew your conclusions. Maybe these aren't as set in stone as religion is, but humans are seeing the problems and are trying to figure it out each day - we used to experiment on humans as if they were lab rats, and then we said 'yeah actually that's wrong and horrible, let's not do that anymore.' Science helps us discover brand new things all the time, and technology is always evolving, which is why we also need to be paying attention to be evolving our rules and morals as we go. We say ""hey AI can make 'art'"" (it's not art, only humans can make art) and then people go 'hey let's use these examples of artists' work to teach the AI', and then the rest of us go ""hey that's actually really fucked up, we can't do that."" It's that push and pull, so what we have to do is keep our eyes open to keep tabs on that and do our best to keep it in check. It doesn't mean science is inherently evil, it's just up to us as humans to decide what is good and what is bad and to enforce that, which we've already been doing since the beginning of time, in religion, and then in law. It seems scary when you're in the middle of it and there's no laws yet, but I think it's bound to happen. Whenever a new technology comes along it can be crazy, until we see what's bad about it and then we regulate it. We have to fight against a lot of money and power to do it, but when has that not been the case? We've always had to fight for things to be right - no one with power or money ever wants to give you things, you have to TAKE them. Men didn't just spontaneously decide one day that women were people, women have been FIGHTING for that for hundreds of years. WE are the checks and balances, not the greedy fucks in power."
2,The way you mentioning 2020 Experience album unlocked such a core memory that I had to pause this video just to go listen to the whole album. The year that that album came out it was my album of the year and one of the few CDs I bought growing up. (My dad was a musician so his CD collection was so extensive that I hardly ever had to buy CDs) but girl did I LOVE that album.
1,"35:09 but you don’t have to associate with the church to have a deep relationship with Christ and the universe, Brittany.

0,"I'm honestly with you on the anxiety going crazy, I've dealt with it too for years but recently its become unmanageable since stopping edibles (should have stopped them a while ago) and I've recently started going to therapy and gotten on anxiety meds, found out I've got ocd as well as adhd, autism and chronic anxiety. Anxiety meds have been a game changer fr. I recommend."
0,Is anyone else getting the same ad over and over again for Venmo but ONLY on Brittany’s videos???
2,I too would be paranoid if i had helicopters that loud outside my house everyday

0,I want to help comfort you in any way I can 😭 I know how spiritual psychosis and feeling lost feels like.. you’ve been a light and sunshine in my life and I hate to see you go through something like this and it’s causing you anxiety. I hope you feel better soon. Btw I enjoyed this episode so much! Thanks for your entertainment and keeping me company! Love you lots Brittany 🫶🏼💕
0,Is it just me or is she getting skinny?
0,Please talk about LA
4,This episode is everything. We are on the exact same wavelength. The anxiety is ringing in my fucking ears
0,"Caffeine and weed on their own, let alone combined, can be enough to cause anxiety that takes days to wear off. Chronic use can fuck people up worse than you would expect, even after being habituated. Idk who monitors these comments but quitting them can be life changing. And, jokes aside, an impending sense of doom and symptoms similar to psychosis are a sign that things are getting dangerous"
1,"So I’ve been going through that spiritual psychosis thing you are dealing with for literal years. And I’m not diagnosing or anything however I will tell you, you described my brain to a T and it is EXHAUSTING… and it is in fact just unmedicated OCD in my experience."
0,"i just made myself a coffee and sweetened with monk fruit queen, twinningg"
0,Absolutely love that Britney didn't know the fire in the prometheus story was symbolic of technology but she made the SAME comparison in her 14 year old writing
0,ALKA SELTZER HELPS WITH UTI!!!!!
0,No talk of Los Angeles? Blocked.
0,lol yeah June about to be crazy. Past Brittany don’t even knowwww
1,"To be real, I think you should be going to a psychologist rather than a tarot/palm reader lol. That's gonna give you real answers and real help."
0,Medical marijuana gave me psychosis straight up. I was on it for pain but then I started seeing little rats in my room and hearing people talking in my garage. I say stop the weed it’s just gonna make it worse. It took me 6 months to realize what was happening to me cuz nobody talk about it
2,Synchronicities led me to follow Jesus. I don’t consider myself a “Christian” though. Jesus is so much deeper than just church
0,BRITTANY I SHUFFLED MYYY TAROT CARDS AS YOU WERE TALKING AND ALSO PULLED THE 10 OF CUPS IM SO SERIOUS
0,Facts! It is Fables and also…. Yes Greek inspired most religious fables too LMAO

1,Swap the weed for meds queen. Your mind and body will thank you! I did the things and haven’t looked back ❤
0,"With the world on fire, it makes sense the anxiety is high af."
1,"Not to be too weird/real/gross, but I kept giving myself UTIs by not cleaning my sex toys properly lmao. Soooo make sure that's in check, look up what material it's made of and what's safe to clean it, and clean it before AND after using it, and also PEE before and after using a sex toy/having sex (I know, it's annoying, but UTIs are way more annoying) and STAY HYDRATED!!!"
1,Wouldve loved if you touched on the ICE raids going on in your backyard and not just on your IG stories
0,"Girl we are seeing the after effects of a level G4 magnetic storm and a LOT of people felt it... also, I am reading The Trial by Franz Kafka, I recommend it, we need absurdism in this time!"
0,Not to add to your spiritual psychosis but there might be a collective consciousness that some of us share?? Cause literally yesterday i was thinking about how un-scientific capitalism is. Its exactly what that muse song was saying! Even though ive never heard that song before. I also struggle with seeing things as signs but trust you have a gift of discernment and your heart is in the right place! So it cant steer you the wrong way ❤ also i feel a BIG shift coming too!!
0,omg you have no idea how much i love the 20/20 experience😭i feel so seen

Had a terrible feeling about my husband leaving for the weekend to go to his best friend’s bachelor party and the morning he was about to leave he was having arm and shoulder pain. I’m hospital avoidant to an extreme but something inside me said we have to go, and thank god, turns out he was having a heart attack. Always trust the weird feeling."

0,Queen I love you but the ads every 5 minutes is driving me crazy
128,"As I reached my late 20's, Redbull started to make me hypomanic and anxious in a way that sounds very similar to what you are describing early in this episode. It was DEVASTATING to me bc Rebull is my life blood and my favorite bev of all time :(  Idk if you drink it every day, but it could be worth trying other caffienated beverages to see if it helps at all."

0,25:15 ohh Shes not alone anymore. That genuinely caught me off guard
0,"supreme leader, i love you. but i know what church hurt is and it is always in the church. the judgement never stops. but i didn’t come back to faith because of the church. i came back because i found the most meaningful relationship i’ve ever been in with a man who died so that i could be forgiven not by the CHURCH but by a lord who genuinely cares about me. Who has looked out for me my whole life without me even knowing it. And right now that man is not happy with the amount of hate that has infested the world. I love human beings even when i want to hate them so much for the racist, homophobic, and greedy actions of their hearts. But we can’t become that. I am choosing to try and root myself in the true love that jesus is shown as in scripture not what my church tells me to believe. The church is merely an extension of faith to have communion. But a. RELATIONSHIP is different. That is personal."
0,i have the same issue with my alexa. i’ve banished the phrase from my vocabulary unless im literally outdoors.
0,"Girl imma need you to lay off the red bulls so you can live long enough to keep entertaining me 😂 but for real tho, those are probably not helping with the anxiety"
102,"Hey, just a reminder that you can believe in God and be a Christian and not go to a church or stand for what the modern day church stands for. I’m a Christian and I recently started a house church with a couple friends. We all have church trauma of one sort or another, and we’d been trying out different churches for a while but there was always something wrong with them. The way they try to force a shallow version of community, the way they judge people for not living exactly the way they do, the way they bring politics into every sermon and shun people with differing views. None of them felt like they were truly living like Jesus told us to. So we decided to just start meeting on Sunday mornings, just the three of us. We listen to some worship songs that we all like, we color and do art, we eat yummy snacks, we read a chapter in Acts, and we pray for each other. And it’s so damn refreshing. And now a few other friends have joined us, and it’s so encouraging and inspiring to have this real community and to be able to freely worship God in the ways we want to and to discuss what it means to live like Christ without all the stifling structure and judgmental culture of a big box church. Highly recommend 👌🏻"

Lymph node draining is something I do once a week with facial massage and skin care. It helps with fluid buildup in your face and neck.

(Seriously talk to your doctor about ocd - I don’t think you’re too unfamiliar with having obsessive thinking!)

I’ve watched my live in partner go through a few psychotic episodes and I’m in school for counselling so from my basic ass 3rd year psych student perspective your speech is too organized and you seem open to other people’s perspectives on shit (with psychosis it’s impossible to convince the person out of their delusions and it’s actually recommended to play along until you get to a psych hospital asap)"

0,story time!!
0,"To all my girls out there who are spiritual, there is truly such a thing as women’s intuition, and while men can be extremely psychic as well it is something that naturally happens to women due to the polarity of their bodies. Women’s physical bodies are negatively charged, and their spiritual bodies are positively charged. Because their physical body is negatively charged they are able to receive pure positive spiritual energy/impulses within their physical body. This is why there were so many female oracles in ancient times. Additionally the womb connects both the physical and the spiritual/heavenly worlds and women are the ones who actually connect both the worlds together. If you and a lot of women around you are all experiencing certain impulses or predictions/futures just be wary of it. Women are natural mediums/intuitives. While I say women I mean most women, of course there are some that are not as psychic or receptive but it is something you can develop to an extreme extent as a biological woman."
0,not to be that astrology bitch but i believe we are the same age which means your Saturn return also just started at the beginning of june…. which could contribute to the feeling something is shifting!

0,"This anxiety your feeling is your amygdala (fear part of your brain) being triggered. Anxiety is a symptom of your brain being triggered, not the causality. Look into the “neck up, neck down” way of dealing with anxiety, I think Mel Robins has a video with a professor called “how to cure my anxiety”. Being that you can’t find out what specifically you’re anxious about, this might be what some people call a “flashback anxiety attack” which is basically your body just following the habit, even though there’s no causality at all"

0,The Venmo ads every 5 minutes is killing me
0,"I think there's a collective anxiety hanging over all of us currently due to the state of the world. Climate change and how one side of the population is trying to tackle it and one side denying it. Capitalism which continues to progress into quite dystopian stages. Cost of living and wider class divide. Social media usage and being stuck in our own echo chambers - in which some hold very extremist views. Facts being treated and argued as opinions. Rise of AI and how fast it is evolving for all the wrong reasons. Kinda being on the brink of ww3? Lolz. Lunatics and idiots running the most powerful countries. Right wing being on the rise. Hate being on the rise. Losing sense of community everyday. Genocide happening in real time and the helplessness it causes to the general public who cares. Just feels like we are constantly mentally preparing of what is to come next - which seems bleak really. So, I feel like it's rational anxiety. And for the neurodiverse - it's that on top of regular anxiety which can be an insane amount to handle. 

However, we do need to focus on love and community. News and algorithms are pushing us to negativity and individualism because that makes a person vulnerable and easier to control. But, I see protests happening all over the world demanding change, I follow great content creators who spread good news and awareness. There's so much good in the world and I do really believe it will win in the end. We just have to stick together for good. Even if it's online communities like these."

0,Love the BIG Event shirt!!! One of my fave college events :)
1,"The anxiety might be bc you are on a cusp of major transformation and enlightenment. Since you talk about opening your third eye, it would make sense to me that your body, mind, and spirit are transforming into a space that has more expansive feeling amd connection to the rest of the univers. I have a feeling that your anxiety for June might be connected to that. I mostly speaking from my own experience and striggles. It just feels to me like you are on a bridge rn. I am a recent watcher and enjoyer but i have been keeping up on the last several as well as some oldies but goodies. A plant woll outgrow its pot, but our ""pot"" is able to always expand with us bc it is in our mind.  Very exciting time for you, but it will not be the last; and this is part of the beauty of life. Idk if youll see this, but i hope you enjoy your Journey.. sometimes the signs just help you tap into your own intuition. Call it ""god"", ""the universe"", ""spirit"", whatever works for you. Hermit in reverse after the 10 of cups upright. You are both. You are in your 10 of Cups but are also yhe Hermit. From my perspective, the cards say ""You must expand"". Id be very interested to know what the rest of your reading would look like."

1,"When facing the truth of our world, looking into the void without blinders, without rose-colored glasses, nihilism is inevitable. I hear you speak about this “spiritual psychosis” and think back to when I myself was grasping for straws, after religious deconstruction, searching for meaning. Facing the void and learning tools for nihilism was the only thing that truly eased my anxiety. No Nonsense Spirituality on YouTube has been the best resource for my own journey navigating existential dread💚"

I think that is something I also struggle with, I do not like going to church and strugle with my believe, but I do not think this is a valid argument. I agree that many churches are bad and that's because they are made of humans(=sinners), but this does not make God not exist. Scripture can still be true even though the church is failing you."

1,Absolutely NEED brittney to watch the sex & the city movies and the spinoff 😭
1,The way I got so happy when she mentioned Clark’s. Because growing up as a kid we were poor. But my mom would save enough money and buy us these shoes. And growing up everyone else had vans and nikes and always hated how ugly they were as a kid. But celebrity now as an adult I hate that I can’t afford it and I hate how I was picked on them and I wish I could tell younger me they were just shoes.
0,"Ugh Aiden is the perfect boyfriend. But he is not the perfect boyfriend for CARRIE. Carrie's ultimate love forever and ever is New York. Aiden is not New York. But you know who is? Big. She compares him to the Chrysler building. Big is awful, Carrie is awful, but now (after watching the show through 6 times lmaooooo), there is no one that could have been with Carrie BUT Big AND New York. Carrie's true love affair is New York and her girls, forever and ever. 

But you are so right, Aiden is my favorite boyfriend, alongside Harry lol."

0,"I gotta say that my favorite SATC character is Samantha. I STRIVE to have her high self esteem and confidence. She continues to choose her own peace. When she offered to pay for and get a breast cancer appointment for both her and the NUN? Crying. 2 women with completely different lifestyles and values and Samantha knew. In that moment, it was just two women looking to survive cancer."

1,"""O Sister, Where Art Thou?"" ft. Brittany Broski"
0,I AM ALSO STARTING MY FIRST WATCH OF SATC!
0,"46:28 fully agree, I thought it was a little misogynist of the show (shocker) that Miranda wanted that baby because ""that's what you're supposed to do as a woman"", she ultimately had guilt about not having a kid. And Steve???!!!! That's who you're yolking yourself to?? 🤮🤮🤮"
0,Why do Brittany and Lord Byron kinda look alike?
0,"58:27 yes I know what you mean girl, because for me that person is you!"
1,"She does the ""shockyyyy"" thing SO WELLLLL"
0,The fact that the two ads I got before this program were for Redbull and Google…
0,Here a 2nd time for the Aiden rant
0,o brother where art thou mentioned!
0,On the sex in the city Miranda situation I think that Miranda having Henry(I think that’s a better name than Brady if I were to name him) and going through with it was NOT for fuck ass Steve but more for herself.I think she wanted to have him because she was tired of always being lonely ig which is weird cuz like get a pet? But i think she did it to like prove to herself that she had like softness and motherly qualities that she had maybe been suppressing in her life yk being a lawyer and this “boss bitch” persona that she lived up to.
0,I want to date a Steve so bad
0,as an educator im actually so glad you brought up Montessori education lol i think you'd actually love it
1,"omg i went to a montessori school and i LOVED it. it literally helped me with organization and i felt so cool and motivated being able to do my work at my own pace as long as its done by the end of the week. ANDD if you finish early on fridays, you get to play the board games in the class UGH the memories"
0,19:13 unfortunately i have also been there and the only solution is to simply let men pay for what they can pay for.
0,god are we the same person? jesus christ
0,watch the movie don’t watch the reboot
0,"Part of me thinks Miranda kept the baby because she knew Charlotte had just experienced a miscarriage. It’s not that she kept the baby for Charlotte, but I believe it added an emotional layer to the decision. I don’t think that’s the main reason, but it might have been something the writers intended. Maybe it changed how she viewed motherhood, even if she never expressed it out loud."
0,"If you're mad at Miranda's character in season 5, wait until you see what the writers have done to her in the reboot. Honestly, don't even watch the reboot or the movies if you want to end the franchise on a good note"
0,I have sunflower suede Clarks as a 28 year old 🥺♥️
0,"You describing Steve made me think of Sabrina’s new sing, “Manchild”!"
0,Just wait till she realizes what happens on And Just Like That😊all for Aiden 👌👌👌
2,"13:23 You’re really can’t understand the way. I screamed at Carrie through the screen of my laptop, when I was watching it. Like the neighbors were appalled of my screaming when she fumbled Aiden. I literally pulled my hair. Don’t get me started on Miranda. Like I can’t even talk about Miranda Case."
1,isnt big's name just... john? lmao

1,The gasp I gasped when you referenced FLUSHED AWAY 37:57!!! One of the best movies ever. Such a good film for British humour
1,Carrie is lowkey the worst character loll
0,"Yelling ""YES YESSSS!!!"" during the bit about kids, while doing my dishes."
0,"I haven't heard anyone talk about parenthood this way in a very long time. Been hearing way too many people say ""I want a baby."" Why? ""Because I want one."" 😩"
0,I’m so sick of the culture of plastic surgery and “work.” I can’t tell you how meaningful it is to hear an influencer share that they don’t intend to get any work done and the desire to age naturally. It’s so upsetting how rare that is.
1,"You made me realize I dated a Steve for 4 years , wtf… I liked Steve in the show and now I get why 😢 fortunately im actually happy with my Aidan"
0,literally started watching sex and the city because of you Broski lmao
0,Omg something IS happening. Like cosmic. It's insane.
1,Why did i ever doubt brittany to give me an out of body laughing experience each and every week
0,My absolute SHOCK when she started singing “Oh Death” at the beginning of the episode! My dad sang that my whole childhood. 😊❤
0,"2:00 Brittany don’t worry I knew I kid in Middle School, specifically 7TH GRADE, who came in not business causal, but FULL SUIT AND TIE. And I swear he never wore the same suit two-three weeks in a row so he was just cranking out 14-21 DIFFERENT full suits out all the time"
0,"I was watching this episode, put my phone in my pocket and accidentally clicked another episode and had no idea until I was about an hour into the other episode 🤣🤣 F1 ??? I thought we were talking about Carrie Bradshaw ! Then I realized 🤣🤣 it’s always all over the place so I was waiting for it to loop back"
0,45:15 this segment is so thought provoking...
0,okay what is the lip pencil tho !!
0,Roman Holiday by Nicki Minaj mentioned !
0,Why does Lord Byron remind me of Gabe from The Office?
0,"The beginning was fucking entrancing, with the vocal flip, oh my god. My only reference point for Brittany's singing up until now was Mask Off 😂"

0,"36:15 dude my cousins grew up montessori and holy moly we are very different, yeah sure they have more life skills are are smarter than me, but i got to watch spongebob so whos the real winner?"
0,Everyone is a good friend EXCEPT carrie
0,YESS im so sick of 1. large age gaps and power imbalances  2. every woman being under the age of 25 in romance media
0,Big stan forever. Shoot me.
0,i cant wait until you get to the first episode of the reboot 🥲
0,IM ALSO A MIRANDA WITH A DASH OF CARRIE AHHHHHHHH TWIN🫰🙏✨❤️
0,I think lord Byron loving/understanding nature was probably why he indulged so hard. I feel a deep understanding of nature leads to a kind of lawlessness in society bc it really is never that deep when you really understand nature at its core
0,"I love it when you yell “THIS IS MY OPINION!!!” 
It brings me so much joy lol"
0,"All of Carrie’s boyfriends sucked. Aidan was not a good guy. He wanted a traditional wife to pop out a bunch of his kids, and Carrie didn’t want that life for herself."
0,GRIAN CHATTEN SUPREMACY BABESSS

0,"No, I agree. I don’t think people understand the enormity of parenthood."

0,Please 🙏🏾😭 make a flushed away movie commentary
0,"46 lady here. It is SO MUCH EASIER to be and feel pretty the older you get. 
Your looks won’t even change all that much, it’s the perspective. I feel so much hotter now than I did in my 20s."
0,I don’t wanna think about aidan it’s too soon
0,my mom sent me to a montessori school as a baby and my sister openly jokes to this day about how one of the worker’s dropped me. wild.
0,starting getting anxious- had to stop and put on brittany…
1,I love that she’s waving around what looks like to be a makeup forever pencil - possibly endless cacao
0,"My grandfather had an original print of Alice in Wonderland, and it was stolen by a nurse who was taking care of him. As well as a huge stubenglass vase next to his front door."
0,Lord Byron is my special interest im jumping from excitment!!!
0,GIRL PERIOD. i'm a 31yo divorcee and i don't care to get married again. but my partner wants to and i love and adore him and i'm more than happy to have a gorgeous wedding with friends and family
0,I went to a Montessori school!! It was everything my adhd brain needed at that age honestly
0,The motherhood breakdown is something that I've been talking about with my friends a lot lately as a 25 year old women in Oklahoma. Obviously some parts here are more progressive but I'm constantly looked at crazy in my smaller town because I haven't had at least one child yet. Then I have to get into the argument that I wouldn't have a child unless I was fully financially stable and in a good relationship because whoever you have a kid with is someone you're now tied to for the rest of your life
0,"As for accents, I think it depends on how malleable your original accent is too. My accent is a ‘base uk accent’, being from very near london, which means it’s a basic london accent. Not cockney, not thick London, just rlly boring 😭. This means that when I spend time with my family from Plymouth, my accent will adjust to their inflections very easily. Granted I’ve known them all my life, but I know it would be harder for a northerner to pick up west country inflections quickly. So, in my experience, it depends on how easily you can mimic/ how easy your accent is to manipulate."
0,It’s also not encouraged to have children since JWs believe the end of the world is right around the corner
0,also did you notice that Big said he didn’t think she was “the marrying kind”? Pretty sure that was before she met Aidan. 😢
0,"Brittany please keep us updated with your SATC watching! I love that show so much. I need to see your freak out once you find out Big’s name, finish the series, and then the movies, and now the newest show."
0,She got that ISTP love interest syndrome me too
0,I knew her ass wasn’t gonna get back to Montessori
0,What’s crazy is my son has the exact same little switch board . He has ADHD and he loves it lol I love it too shyttt 😂😂😂
0,Not calling me out for buying my son the switch board 😂 he just loves buttons.
0,"This girl I went to high school with moved to the UK after college and it’s been less than 5 years, I knew that wack ass accent was fake"
0,41:35 BALTIMORE SHOUTOUT🗣️🥳
0,Let’s gooooo Fontaines DC!🇮🇪
0,Don’t watch and just like that if you like miranda
0,I actually love that Miranda had the baby. She lost her mom and was facing possible infertility in her mid 30s. She wanted a kid and got it maybe not in the ideal way but it was on her terms. The show at the time showed a completely different type of motherhood. Someone who was fiercely independent becoming a mother in a fresh new way that wasn’t so cliched.
0,side note but brittany your makeup looks so good in this episode !!
1,Ok i will also watch sex and the city for the first time damn🙄
0,Wooder is Philly but it’s ok bbg
0,I unapologetically love Carrie

1,the switch board is actually helpful for practicing hand eye coordination! Its used for adults in occupational therapy too.
0,She gone loose her mind at The Carrie Diaries
0,Aidan was truly the one. Big is truly the fucking WORST.
0,aiden won me over when he just wanted to stay in and eat a bucket of chicken from KFC! lol!!!
0,"Um yeah I actually do know about O Death it’s one of my favorite of that style of American folk songs 💀💀💀 I used to sing it rly loud every week on the way home from choir to practice singing by myself!!! Originally by Lloyd Chandler in the 20s but popularized by Dr. Stanley. Tim Eriksen on here does another version I really like, actually a couple, and all his stuff is that exposed vocal style that rewards a voice like yours that can have a lot of purity. O Death is one of the top ten formative songs of my life, so much so that I almost didn’t even register that you were singing it at the opening because it’s part of my soundtrack at all times lol and then freaked out."
0,"My 4 year old walking by while I’m watching and folding laundry: “she looks pretty on your phone, Miss Brittany looks pretty”"
0,38:08 I LOVEEE FLUSHED AWAY
0,Listen.. you better NEVER ghost us because you do what Jenna marbles did for me in the early 2000s.
0,If I heard you giving this SATC breakdown at the next table in a restaurant no one would get any attention from me until you were done. I watched it when it aired and you’re so right…and I can’t wait for you to keep watching 🎉
1,Hahaha I was listening when my mom came in and she said… she’s mad… and Brit says “I’m pissed off” right after 😂😂
0,I will be handing back the just pretty pamphlet for others to pass around.
0,Great video but holy shit brittany i had to sit thru about 14 ads for the venmo debit card…. please save me….. too many ads
0,"As someone who LOVES SATC, I totally get how you feel about Carrie and Aidan. Rewatching it, I do sympathize with Aidan because he gave Carrie so much and was so patient with her. Carrie agreed to marry Aidan because she felt that was something she should do, but ultimately she realized that while she loved Aiden, she didn't love herself with Aidan. She didn't handle things correctly, but Aidan never truly loved Carrie for who she was completely and fully. Big and Carrie understood each other better because Big understood that while Carrie loved him, she loved New York more. In the show, New York stands for independence, and to Carrie, New York is who she is. At the time in the show, she wasn't ready to give up New York to become a version of herself that she *should* have been in her mid-thirties. And while cheating and breaking off her engagement was a fumble, she was choosing to protect her identity before turning into someone she wasn't."
0,Big's name is John James Preston
0,"I can’t ever agree when someone thinks Aidan and Carrie were great and Carrie messed up. Big and Carrie are UNFORTUNATELY made for each other. To say Carrie should’ve ended up with Aidan is silly because they didn’t gel as well as Carrie and Big even though Carrie and Big are messy, they are messy together."
0,I hardly laugh at loud at things online anymore but I swear to GOD Brittany has me cackling uncontrollably with my feet kicking in the air. 😂
2,Brittany and Mike's Mic watching SATC for the first time together is legendary
0,Aidan is played by the wonderful John  Corbett. Been watching another 90s show he was in before that called Northern Exposure. Good stuff!
0,Holy fuc I go5 chills from intro singing my GOODNESS GRACIIOUS
0,35:29 my grandma recently told me my mom was sucking on tinker toys when she was little because she figured out it would make her tongue blue and she could write on the wall with it. Riddled with lead paint. 😭 I was like oh ok that checks out.
0,fucking venmo ads are gonna be THE DEATH OF ME!!!!!!

0,just saw fountaines dc last night at primavera sound and can confirm it was life changing
0,"10:00 he did it all, the man lived. Sex and the City came out in 1998, you're a little late. 40:27 if you move there and consume only British stuff and don't listen to American, you will pick up the accent"
0,"Professor Broski!!! Professor Broski!!!! English Lit undergrad here 🙋🏻‍♀️you’re absolutely right about the Romantic period/Romanticism. If I’m not mistaken, the Romantic period is the only historical period named after a literary movement! The Romantics, within the rise of industry and the Industrial Revolution, analyzes man’s relationship with nature. Nature, overall, will mean more to man than our physical objects ever will. Arguably, as humans are of nature, our relationships with each other will ALSO mean more to us than physical objects. Very timely, I must say. 

If you appreciate Byron (same), I would definitely recommend William Wordsworth: specifically, his “Tintern Abbey” poem is gorgeous. 

Blah blah blah and whatnot"
1,Brittany when are you gonna talk about Sinners? That movie has me in a chokehold
0,"I'm not sure how much of a gamer Brittany or most of this fan base is, but I recently played Expedition 33 and there is a quote in it that says ""I love my children SO much that I will not have them"" and that resonated with me in such a deep and painful way. 

Sidenote kind of: Ive been going on tangents about this game the same way Brittany does when she's found a new form of media that completely takes over and touches her soul. The story is INCREDIBLE and unbelievably touching. It's main focuses are art (painting especially), grief, and family. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend to both Brittany and anyone who, like me, has a similar love and passion for art and story telling like she does. Im a painter so it hit home a little extra for me, but!!! What I would do to watch Brittany do a let's play of this game!!!!!! OR EVEN JUST TALK ABOUT IT IN A POD😭"
0,Movies first then the sequel
0,"Dear Egalitarian leader, I beg of thee to say something about the ICE occupation of LA on this next episode!! Your voice would mean so much to the organizers on the ground 🙏"

0,"So many things to discuss wow 
I feel the exact same way about being a parent and im a gay man lmao. The moment my partner comes to me with a “i really want to adopt a baby” we’re breaking tf up. I am not up for the task. The pressure is too much and I wouldn’t even have to go through pregnancy which is a whole other ball park like what the hell"
0,u better make a cover of that old death song
2,you know people might think a certain way about the fact that you don’t feel maternal but the world would probably be much better if more people accepted that they aren’t meant to be mothers either instead of just having children because they think they have to.
0,Its different person to person. My guess… you’d pick up the accent quick

0,Brittany clocking mr Big having the whitest name ever is CRAZYYY
0,"Came from spotify just to comment this; in regards to the marrying someone because it means so much to them even though you're indifferent - thats me!! I married my husband even tho I've never had the biggest interest in weddings or marriage as an institution. I'm white Aussie with no reiligion in my family - not very traditional either. He's Indian Hindu where he holds dear traditions thats serve a purpose to bring together family and celebrate commitment in a spiritual way. So I married him cause I wanted to be a part of his life and culture in that way!! (Big fat indian wedding with all its colour and joy and festivities) When you love someone, you love all of them, and when you get the opportunity to be welcomed into their world you take it!! 
So yeah youre not crazy.

0,"Omg yes the feeling like you can just *be pretty* or to just enjoy cute things. True feminity and comfort in that has been so demonized in media for so long. ESPECIALLY in childrens media, which is so integral to your relationship to social roles. Its only recently that ive really indulged in decorating my things and having cute little puff balls on my bags and plushies in my car for the pure reason that i think its cute. I dont need to justify every single decision behind ""well yes its pink but it also is a stand!"" Its the same as ""well yes im pretty but im also smart!"""

0,15:18 LOL big is JOHN
0,"the oNLY reason i was okay with carrie flopping with aiden, is because she DIDNT DESERVE HIM!! they were not right for each other ultimately. its the perfect example of two people who love each other but are fundamentally different.  neither of them were really willing to compromise and had strong personalities. 

big and carrie are toxic but lowkey they both have toxic personalities so they end up being ""perfect"" for each other if that makes sense.  big could give carrie the lifestyle that she wanted. which is why im like ya let aiden go and have his own life with kids and stuff."
0,I am all here for the sisterhood that SATC brings but during pride month I refuse to let yall forget the episode where the transphobia was so awful that a group of trans women got boiling water thrown at them. That is literally a hate crime and I will not rest until it’s acknowledged by cis people.

For accent changing I can say my mom moved from Pennsylvania with a heavy Pennsylvania Dutch accent in her early 20s to Indiana and started picking up the accent out here and then right before she turned 30 she married my dad (Kentucky southern) and she now has a slight southern accent with a Midwest accent so I think you can pick up an accent when you move to anywhere at any age"

0,"I watched SatC when it first aired lol and I 100% agree with you on everything lol 😆 I was really disappointed with the whole Miranda pregnancy thing and the show runners and writers had the perfect opportunity to actually show up for their friend and make a statement that it’s about choosing the best thing for you being extremely difficult but they did what everyone wanted, they let her have the baby and as you said it dances around with the idea that she regrets her decision but they never talk about it. It’s such a frustrating show to watch 😅"

0,"OMGGG IM GONNA RANT ABOUT AIDENNN 

I don’t like him. Not as a character or as a man but more in the sense of Carrie. She doesn’t want the lifestyle Aiden wanted/ provided, it was so clear that Aiden is more on the traditional side than Carrie ( AND THATS OKAY ) I feel like that played such a big part of their break up. 
Carrie is the type of person who will spend thousands of dollars on shoes while Aiden would spend that much money for a city retreat, the city THAT CARRIE LOVES SO DEARELY. 

I fucking hate big but I really yearned him and carrie to be the end game, mainly because how both of them are so broken and toxic that they harmonise so well. And in a way Aiden is too good for her. He will be constantly comprising if he was with her. 

( I haven’t seen just like that and I’m not planning to either )"
0,“I don’t want to see big anymore!!!!” Brittany you will love ‘And Just Like That’
0,Okay so basically I went to Montessori school for many years and my takeaway from it was that before lunchtime we would work alone in silence and basically learn to “teach ourselves” and then after lunch would be group work and working with the teacher. I loved it

0,31:22 I mean yeah like for me even before my parents got divorced I didn't really believe in marriage just because I don't like the idea of the government meddling in my love affairs and having a legal document. I just don't like paperwork and I think if you love someone and you wanna have a party and devote yourself to that person that's totally cool you can wear a dress and everything but I just don't like the capitalistic almost money deal part of it.

2,"I really do think Miranda would have got an abortion had Charlotte not been having fertility issues. I think the contrast was an obviously dynamic plot point for TV , but season 1,2,3 and even early 4 Miranda wouldn’t have questioned it for a second that she would have put her career first ESPECIALLY since she made the “Steve is a man child” comments when they dated. Without Charlotte’s feelings being involved, and her judgement/feelings of jealousy when she finds out Miranda isn’t going to keep the baby, Miranda would have gone through with the abortion and not thought twice."
1,"As a mother on the topic of motherhood you are completely right!! Being a mother who addresses her child's needs on every level is A LOT of work and it's beautiful and scary. I always knew that I'd end up being a mother and had a huge strong desire to raise a child better adjusted and prepared for the world than how I was brought up.. BUT between the economy, political/environmental reality of today, I don't blame anyone for not wanting (or being mentally prepared enough) to do the same. But I was living a path spewn with destruction and having a child was the best thing that has ever happened to me and seeing the beautiful connections he makes on a daily basis make me tear up and so proud and thankful for each moment I have on this earth. Much love and many blessings to you and your viewers 🤗"

0,I'm here for the important cultural references like rage over Carrie being shtty to Aidan and Flushed Away 😂 larva larva larva
1,"30:32 the issue with Aidan and Carrie is they're completely different people with completely different interests and sure there is love there but if who you are if what makes you who you are is a negative fault in another persons eyes you just aren't compatible like aidans chill ness was just fine but Carrie got bored of it because she's not that kind of person she's a very bubbly out there person so when two people who are too different get together they start sacrificing parts of them that they shouldn't just because it doesn't match with the other persons personality I've seen it time and time again just because Carrie is not like Aidan doesn't make her a bad person it just makes her different but she was trying so hard to guilt herself into changing who she is for Aidan which just didn't feel like it would be healthy in the long term for her there relationship would only work if one of them changed their personalities in a big way and I think ""spoilers"" in the new show when big passes I think she changed as a person and now is ready for a relationship with Aidan"
2,30:05 as a lesbian Aidan was a bit boring for me and I think for Carrie too I think Carries ego was just bigger than aidans and once she was humbled by life she realized the gem of a human being who cared for her

0,28:24 yes you're a goddess and you will remain one even in your old age and in your passing🤍✨
30,"As someone who’s never watched Sex and the city, I can still comfortably say that men like Aiden DO exist. It’s extremely hard to trust men after so many humiliating and dehumanizing experiences with past men in my life and that’s where we relate Brittney. When I say that my boyfriend is genuinely my soulmate I truly believe it. You’re right, there is absolutely nothing like female friendships and the intimacy that is between sisterhood. But there is a special relationship that can cultivate with your partner that’s like no other. My boyfriend is someone I can be the silliest and stupidest with. He also cherishes me for my intelligence and truly believes I’m the most beautiful and lovely person in the world. There aren’t just men LIKE Aiden, but there is one Aiden in the world that is meant for you. I have never believed in soulmates before. I thought dating was just a hit or a miss and we do it until we find someone we can tolerate. But my boyfriend is my everything. Not in a possessive way. In a - I see him in everything. He’s the sun and the clouds on a clear day. He’s the warm water in the shower that hits my back in the shower. He is the tingly feeling in my hand when I pet a cat. His love has poured into every corner of my life and has made my life more colorful than I could’ve ever imagined. I hope you experience it one day with your Aiden too."

0,I think I’ve read before that both Cynthia Nixon and Sarah Jessica Parker were actually both pregnant and they chose to write that story line for her so she didn’t have to hide the pregnancy on screen. So I feel like Miranda would have never been a mother but there was no choice lol. Also I think a Miranda mother storyline made a lot more sense than a Carrie storyline & I feel like hiding 2 pregnancies would have been hard in the show.
0,I love that you haven’t found out Big’s real name yet lol I love the predictions
0,"montessori is a teaching style, its usually child-lead learning, meaning the kids choose what subjects they are interested in learning and so what they learn day to day looks different. the toys are very minimalistic and often wooden. a big draw for montessori schools and the montessori teaching method is that it helps kids learn to become self sufficient- at a young age they're pouring their own drinks from pitchers, serving their own food (montessori lunches are often served as family-style dining where they serve themselves and pass bowls/plates around), they can button their own clothes and zip them. The program is supposed to foster independence and independent learning. the idea is that children will enjoy learning more if its at their own leisure and not forced upon them. A lot of the teacher's responsibility is to stand back and observe and not be involved much, which for me personally is a drawback. Anyway the toys are designed more for efficiency and less for aesthetics. They want kids to use them to learn things such as math, so a lot of them involve moving parts. Also, montessori classes are usually mixed age- this allows the older kids to help teach life skills to the younger ones. I worked in a 3-5 year old age group and they were given specific activities based on their ability level and age but we encouraged the older kids to help the little ones if they wanted to."
0,Montessori is a child-centered approach to education where learning is emphasized by play and independence.. GOD BLESS HAVING A PSYCH DEGREE! No one gets me

0,"While Aidan was really secure, sweet and loving first time around the second time around their relationship didn't make a lot of sense since it was obvious he was having a hard time forgiving her. I just can't erase that scene from my head where she's gushing over him and how he's a perfect boyfriend (while he's doing nothing special) and him giving her a cold shoulder and getting revenge by flirting with his coworker. Also it felt like she wanted to get him back not because she really loved him but  kinda saw him as a challenge. When she was trying to get him back he felt more like Big, therefore making him more attractive. But as soon as they start dating and he becomes secure again and trying to nest with her she freaks out because he was never her guy. He was never really the one she wanted and he couldn't provide for her the life that she wanted at the time, or better yet, she wasn't ready for the life that he could provide. So her saying no to the marriage wasn't really a ""I'm not ready for marriage"" it was ""I'm not ready to get married to you (and I never will be because I'm waiting for something better to come along)"""

0,"Ive always thought that people hate Carrie so much because it’s always uncomfortable to see a mirror of ourselves. People hate being reminded of the time we smothered a man, or let ourselves get walked over, or made a selfish decision, made someone else’s problems about ourselves, failed being there for someone we love in our own struggles, or for some reason didn’t want to choose the calm and loving partner and go back to the toxic one. I feel like most of us have been her at least once, or live her patterns more long term. I’ve always found that I’m most judgemental of people who have the same flaws as me - and I always have to check myself HARD 😅 I think people are so much more forgiving about the other three characters because they’re less exposed than carrie is - and probably more dramatised caricatures that people WANT to be like, but actually aren’t.   
Also can I just say, ppl complain about why they always talk about carries problems…uh she’s the main character? Like yes the four of them are but she’s still the narrator and main player - that’s why we hear about her life the most??"
0,"24:40 I loved Aiden the first time around. The second (maybe this is an unpopular opinion) but he was almost sickeningly insecure. Slapping her back hard, being hostile and considering cheating. He shouldn’t have gotten back together with someone at makes him so, so insecure….

The marriage stuff I just thought was small minded misogyny. Also made me feel gross. He didn’t need to pressure her and women don’t have to get married even when they love someone so much. If it’s important to him, too bad. she should be more important than a misogynistic tradition. He was married with a baby to another woman within less than a year. He didn’t want her. He wanted marriage, final."
0,Wait girl I think it was Henry David H that said love not man less but nature more
0,"As your oldest and divorced listener… I was your age when I was married and was married 16 years. The reason you get married, isn’t for everyone else. It should be for you two. Like the both of you, want to make the commitment to each other. The rest is a party, which is great… but shouldn’t be the reason(imo). I think the reason she didn’t say yes to Aiden, wasn’t because he was not all the things on paper..  but rather, she didn’t feel like she was home with him.  That’s a very esoteric concept or statement, and doesn’t sound real. But when you find that person, or crave that feeling of being genuinely yourself.. not having to pretend or wear any cape or mask, just you and them being 100% yourself… 
That’s not easy to find. You can vibe, they can be nice, they can check every single box.. but that feeling?? That’s not something you can quantify. 
But, yes, Carrie annoys me too, boo."

0,How the fuck did I guess that Big looked like a Henry before you even said it!!
356,"As an AP Lit & AP Lang teacher, I must confess I sometimes will take notes while she starts talking about literature & literary periods. It’s so nice to hear an authentic perspective of curiosity points that I truly believe my kids in my class may perk their ears at like her. Also, I will pause the episode FREQUENTLY to respond out loud to questions / comments about literature as if she’s front row listening to my lecture over romanticism & Mary Shelley."
0,So i’m now watching sex and the city bc i never did. Thank you Brittany 😂❤
0,big definitely has the most white man name
0,So sorry you have to experience the end of sex in the city. My condolences
0,"48:04 it was because Miranda’s biological clock was ticking. Early on she learns that she is running out of eggs, so when she does get pregnant, she freaks out and believes that it might be her last or only chance to have a kid. And it makes sense as this is unfortunately true for some women irl too. Also LOVE that we happened to watch sex and the city at the same time. Love ya, girl 🫶🏻"
0,37:04 my father is canonically both a dj and an electrical engineer so shoutout him ‼️

0,Madam Broski PLEASE do a deep dive on Montessori pedagogy.
0,Girl I KNOW some Ralph Stanley
1,Enjoy the joy of watching Sex & the City before it gets ruined by the movies and And Just Like That... girl.
3,36:19 Montessori was a female Italian child theorists who started schools with mixed age groups centered around self-directed learning. Teachers are considered a guide at the side and rely heavily on observations as students have free choice of materials that serve practical purposes. Some of the materials are pretty wild though.
0,Big is trash.
1,Whatever you do don’t watch And Just Like That…
1,"Looking back on the Miranda baby storyline I wonder fi they were trying to write what was expected of women back then, child rearing. Like it was the end goal. She was already a successful lawyer, but maybe this felt like it would complete her life. However, everything else about Miranda's character from my standpoint was CLEAR that she did not want a child. She was getting her coins! But alas - writer's rooms and all, especially in the late 90's."
0,She was so close to guessing Big‘s name. So close
0,Big's name would be RUSSELL bro
0,brittany PLEASE watch girls
1,Anyone else feel like some Broski Analysis of video games would go so hard 😭

0,"37:50 okay you know flushed away, immediately my already high appreciation for you has sky rocketed once again LMAO. flushed away is one of my favourite films of all time, my brother and i grew up with the dvd and we've watched it so many times to the point where i can quote practically the entire thing. when we talk to each other there's an 80% chance that a flushed away quote will exit our mouths pfff"
0,"My son has that switch board, it literally just teaches how to work the different types of switches to turn things on. No electrical anything is visible, and it just turns on lights."
0,Not the way I was called out twice in this episode. First with the Chuys jalapeño ranch and then about being a southern woman who just has a thing for bedazzled stuff💀
0,Im so glad Brittany got into Sex and the City! She still has so much to go 😅 Im like girl you have so much more to see! ❤
1,"the freakout about having children is so real. some people can't seem to comprehend the level of responsibility that comes with bringing a child into the world, which is crazy since it's such a huge decision. with the way things are going now and how much i value my independence and quiet time, i just don't want kids."
0,"I think Carrie as a character represents the average unhealed unconscious person and when we watch her from an outsider’s perspective we see that she makes all these stupid irrational decisions and I think that as outsiders we believe we wouldn’t be Carrie or do as she does but the reality is we are, and have done or have been in her exact situation. It’s quite complex and I feel like women might understand this more, but when you are so deeply in love with a specific person it is almost like you give them a piece of yourself or your soul, and you are willing to put all their flaws, toxic behaviors and issues to the side because you love who they are fully and completely. Then when they leave it’s like all that time, energy, care, and passion you put into them is just meaningless to them. You quite literally gave them a piece of yourself you will never ever get back and you will be constantly looking for that piece in everyone you meet after if you’re not healed. Sometimes that takes a long time."
0,the dunkins ad right after the homer simpson impression 😂 iconic!

I'm back in the States now for almost 4 years, but I still call things silly little British names and have a slight accent on certain words and comes out more when my tongue is lazy like being drunk. Plus I'm in Michigan so very close to the Canadian accent. I'm also a ex theater kid so accents were kinda always my thing...like you. Your Gemma Collins is spot on. Love ya ta x"
0,When is she going to discover The Avett Brothers!!!
0,My sisters watching it to recently . I connected the dots  back in the day of the vine someone wants to be Carrie Bradshaw.
0,"i binged SATS last month. And yeah I have so many thoughts. I was annoyed that Miranda had the baby because she was always so against it before. And Steve is so annoying, like pushing her to have it because it’s a “baby” like, you know it’s gonna grow up and it’s gonna age your financial and parental responsibility for 20 years right. And I do think people put such little thought into procreating, it’s scary. Children are a luxury now, not a right."

0,Brittany needs to watch girls
0,"Your rant on the power imbalance double standard really punched me in the throat ngl, my dating track record is also full of malnourished unemployed men with self esteem issues or no drive and it’s so so so hard to deal with as a woman who makes VERY good money in a male dominated career. I want a trophy husband that doesn’t feel jealous or invalued by my success!!!! I love being a girly girl and embracing my femininity but the power imbalance takes a bite out of that every time I meet a new man who feels emasculated!!!!!!! I know u don’t care but I need to get it out and it makes me want to scream and shit my pants so thank u for this ep it’s very special and very validating to me"
0,I love sex and the city fav show of all time
0,SATC changed me last year… I went into thinking that Carrie would be the protagonist only to find out she was an antagonist in her own worst enemy…. The way she treated Aiden was terrible and the fact that she invited to Aidan’s cabin and Aiden was OK with it. I WAS FLOORED
1,Not me IMMEDIATELY knowing it was Oh death by Ralph Stanley!!! Us Appalachian blue grass girlies get it  😂😘
0,Wait till Brittany discovers there’s baby DJ sets now
0,"100% agree about Aidan! She fumbled so bad, I would do anything for that man"
0,You should check out mark zonko music
0,"As someone who knows absolutely nothing about Sex in the City, I think not having any context for these names and faces really enhances the margarita gossip date vibes. Like- ""He looks like his name is Henry. Or Jake."" OOOHHH I GET IT NOW that's all the context I need, I'm understanding, I getcha"
1,Carrie and Big are a trainwreck happening in slo motion. Carrie is essentially… Aiden’s “Mr. Big”. He can’t look away from the trainwreck because it’s pretty. She makes him feel fancy just like Mr. Big makes Carrie feel fancy.
0,"I'm a Brittany Stan, but the ""annoying girl"" voice she does really grates on me when she talks about centering men. It's the first thing that comes to mind; why is that specific form of femininity bad in her mind? I'd really love for her to dive into that."

0,"28:45 Hey Brittany, I’m working on getting my esthetician license and RN so that I can do procedures like botox, but my one thing is I don’t want to ever push someone to get it or allow someone to overdo it. It’s going to be a few years before I get my RN done, but if you ever decide that you do want even a little bit of “work” done, you will always have a spot in my chair. I won’t let you (or any other client) do so much to where you don’t look like your natural, beautiful self, or pressure you into getting something done. Aging is a beautiful thing that everyone goes through, I just want to make sure everyone feels comfortable with that process🫶🏻💖"

0,"What is so crazy about SATC to me is what opinions of mine have changed or stayed the same since the first time I binged the series (AT 18 BTW) 
Like what was 18 year old me judging the girls (and myself for) vs me now, late 20’s, with more wisdom, mistakes, but also forgiveness in my heart.

Like, seriously, watching my friends and I go through these things  that women before us WERE ALSO NOT SAFE FROMMM

0,"I'm the breadwinner in my household and probably always will be. It's no shade to my husband, we just work in different fields and the wages in one is incomparable to the other. A few years ago I bought him a very expensive birthday gift and a friend (who is now an ex friend) started joking along the lines of ""How do I get a rich girl like that"" and my husband completely shut him down with ""You never will because you're not willing to support a girl like that"" his friend started to argue back but my husband continued ""You would never cook dinner every night so she could study, you would never accept that she is not available for you during exam season and you would never accept that a girl as educated as she is knows more about certain things than you so you would never get a girl like that."" I didn't know this at the time but said 'friend' has been 'joking' a few weeks before that about how my husband is less of a man because I pay more of the bills. Glad my husband saw sense and cut him out but it goes to show, some men don't want to support but want the benefits"

0,"Re: SATC
A lot of the tonal shift with SATC is 1. 9/11 and 2. Jenifer Anastin using a contract renegotiation to have more influence over the writing and Carrie's character, hence she becomes less tomboyish and a bit more frivolous and less independent as the show goes on - as famously JenAn had issues connecting with Carrie's character in the early show. I think she kind of redeems herself in the end a bit though. 

Def watch Broey Deschanel's videos on SATC, they're so good."

1,"Brittany! Primary Montessori guide here. Montessori is the best. It’s an education method that prioritizes independent thinking, communication, self confidence and so much more. That board thing is so dumb bc it’s not based in reality, it’s just a fiddle toy. Lots of non authentic Montessori stuff out there. Look up AMI Montessori"

0,"Brittany, I need to thank you for your viewpoint on motherhood. I do want a child eventually but post marriage at 27, as someone who’s always grinded and left little room for enjoyment, I don’t feel the desire to have a child (right now) that I feel others push me to feel like I need to have. I struggle thinking that there is something wrong with me, or putting it into words when people ask me why I’m not ready yet. When you said “I the responsibility of motherhood is not lost on me.” That’s exactly what it is. LET ME ENJOY MY FUCKING LIFE WITH NO ADDED RESPONSIBILITY OR TIMED CHECKLIST FOR A LITTLE, DAMN"

0,"do you think Lord Byron loved nature so much because him, himself was the worse of the worst in humanity and he hated himself for it? which is why it was self destructive? and that’s why he loved nature so much because it was an unobtainable earthly heaven?"
0,wait until she sees the sex and the city movie

6,"You don’t understand Carrie bc you’re not a Carrie. She’s dismissive avoidant, she’s afraid of commitment just like big, so aiden is a big no for her. She loves big and thrives off the drama and loves feeling in the right when it comes to him. She’s more committed than him so she feels right. But with aiden, even though on paper it’s the best for her, she’s scared. Watch the show about 6 times and you’ll see the viewpoint even if you don’t agree."
0,When she was guessing Mr. Big’s name and I’ve seen the entire series multiple times all the way thru and the first movie is my favorite movie of all time 👀👀

2,"byron had a kid?? girl, that's ADA LOVELACE you're talking about!"
0,"While listening to you talk about being ""just pretty,"" to me, it sounds like the space you take up in a room. I feel like by being smart or funny, that was your ""excuse"" to take up a space not peodominently owned by women, let alone, plus sized women. You haven't gotten to enter a room or space and be allowed to take up space just because of how you look alone. Your personality had to make up for the space you took up previously. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but that's how I understood your discourse on being ""just pretty."""

0,this is my first time watching the broski report i’m dying at her literally just crashing out in the first few minutes 😭
0,"I also loved aidan, but he was too good for carrie and they shouldn't be end game.
Carrie LOVED how unsafe Big made her feel because it validated how she felt internally and Aidan was too safe and she seemed bored and anxious to be with him. Even though he was a safe and calming presence, she would always want the glamour and uncertainty that Big offered.
Besides, Aidan is a TOTAL father figure and carrie isn't. I guess he wouldn't be fulfilled without kids, so its great that he moved on and made a family of his own."
0,The Chuy’s mention!! I love my Texas girl.
0,"I spent most of my sophomore and part of my junior year of high school in love with Lord Byron (le sigh). How could we not be in love with a club footed bisexual who inspired writing of the more imperious, lordly  vampire that led to Dracula. Who hoarded in a group of young conquests in order to entertain himself during a dark and dreary summer who just happened to include Mary Shelly and her husband. His mind games then of course inspired ‘Frankenstein’ out of the mother of Science Fiction. Oh yes girl I spent quite a long time not being able to get un-fixated off of wandering wordsmiths who are nothing but trouble. One almost mythical long dead one and several (live) much more disappointing ones throughout my young adulthood. 
And I absolutely agree our best friends should be our focus and let those other losers come and go (lol) as easy as the tides."
0,Carrie did not deserve Aidan ❤️‍🩹
0,finally someone SAYS IT! AIDAN IS THE BEST BOYFRIEND!!!!! THANK YOU QUEEN BROSKI

0,who’s gonna tell her about big
0,Yeah but what about us women that struggle with relationships with women I’ve longed for sisterhood and I have yet to really find it
0,I read the title and thought this was royal court
0,"i just rewatched SATC all the way through cause I'm the same age as her in season 2. watching it now vs when I was a teenager is vastly different

0,From the homer Simpson imoression to the donut transition was perfect 😭
1,"After SATC, you HAVE to watch the Carrie Diaries with Austin Butler!!"
0,the album . i just sat upright in bed
0,"Can’t believe someone as young as you is watching tired ass, sexist SATC.  The fuck?"
0,"I agree with everything you said regarding Aiden, and to answer your question frankly, Carrie didn't deserve him. They weren't compatible, and he deserved better than someone who cheated on him, and then strung him along, all while maintaining her ""friendship"" with the ex she cheated on him with before.

If he was one of your girlfriends you would be screaming at her to leave his ungrateful selfish ass. Imagine your friend tells you her serious boyfriend takes calls from his ex in the other room, invites her to your friend's summer home when she gets dumped, and it's the same ex he cheated on her with/the reason they broke up last time. You would be slapping her and calling her a blind fool. Begging her to DUMP HIM. 

The same goes for poor Aiden. Carrie took full advantage of his kindness, his trust, and his patience. AND HE STILL WANTED TO MARRY HER. Nah, boy, run. Run FAR and fast."
0,the baby i babysit has the same switchboard toy hahahaha
0,Somehow the episode topics are always uncannily relevant to my life at the time 😭

0,"I have no one to talk about sex and the city with😔.

The littlest thing that really ticked me off about Carrie with her whole situation with Aiden  is AFTER HE FORGAVE HER and her computer broke and he was literally speaking so nicely to her the whole time being cute and she was getting so mad.LIKE IT MADE ME VIEW HER DIFFERENT. Does anyone remember that episode?

AND somebody finally feels the same about Steve ! I think just like Samantha Miranda was supposed to end up single, I don’t know it just felt so right or with who had the same views as her. I feel like Steve tried to make her out to be a soft girl when that’s really never what she was."
2,I listen to you before my nursing shifts at 6:30 am. Thank you. You keep my spirits high <3

0,sighhhhhhhhhhhh. she gets me.
180,"I just wanted to say that I deeply agree with your views on motherhood. The idea that we don’t have to have children to be fulfilled or validated is so important, and I really admire how you speak about it with honesty and perspective. You’re not “crashing out.” You’re not wrong. You’re just telling the truth — and it’s refreshing.

I love that you take into consideration the reality of what having a child actually means — emotionally, physically, financially, and spiritually. It’s not something to be taken lightly, and your willingness to say that out loud means a lot. We live in a world where so many people are stuck in the mindset that life has to follow one path: study hard, get a good job, have a family. But the truth is, that’s not the only way to live a meaningful or happy life.

We are our own beings. We don’t need to have children to be fulfilled, to be loved, or to love. We are allowed to enjoy our own lives fully — just as they are. And hearing someone like you say that helps people like me feel seen.

I don’t know if you’ll ever read this. But if you do, I hope you know how valued you are. Your opinion is one of the few that really challenges people to think differently, and that kind of honesty has the power to do real good in the world.

With love and appreciation,
D.B."

6,"the motherhood rant was so relatable, I've never felt maternal as well and the current state of the world makes me never want kids. when I started dating my husband this was an extremely important topic, if he was someone that really wanted kids I would have never proceeded with the relationship"

0,"I bought my 2 year old nephew that switch board and let me tell you, he is actually obsessed! He could stare at those lights for hours and just click buttons. It’s really good for fine motor skills which is something that has seen a decrease with reliance on touch screens"
62,"I taught and used the Montessori method for a church I worked for! It basically aims to encourage and empower children in their natural curiosity and exploration. Part of the method is using wooden toys and minimizing screen time while giving children opportunities to take ownership of their learning experience. You also rotate specific tasks among the children (like oh, Rebeckhanthy is going to do snack prep this week and Bobert is going to do it next week and we'll have Hayleigh and Khaleesi rotate out for next week). You don't demand, you don't coerce, everything is framed as best as possible as empowering the child WIHLE ALSO reinforcing structure and discipline (discipline in the sense of accomplishing goals, not in the punitive sense)"

0,"O death from o brother where art though, chilling scene"
0,I think a big reason Miranda had a baby is because she was scared she wouldn’t get another opportunity to in the future. She had the ‘lousy` ovary scare earlier in the show so when she was thinking about her decision that probably impacted in it.

0,"my only criticism of aiden was when he was pushing her to get married. she physically reacted to wearing a wedding dress by breaking out in a rash and he still pushed her harder and harder. also, forcing a marriage doesn’t mean that your partner won’t betray you (which was his main motivation to marry her so fast after getting back together). and i was so mad that he made me side with carrie like WHAT😐i hated him for that. but he was such a good bf and Carrie needs to join a convent or something bc oh my god she pisses me off 😭😭😭😭😭"

She was always a hard worker and it showes with how she becomes a mother and works on her career"

0,"1. Brittney, no, Bigs name is not Jake.... no.

3. Carrie fumbled Aiden, yes, but Aiden was not for Carrie. She didnt deserve Aiden.
4. I CANNOT F-ING WAIT FOR YOU TO MEET BERGER.

0,the way I GASPED at the steve slander.
1,"47:20 You’re absolutely spitting! 🔥🔥 I’m a mom and the weight of responsibility on me is HEAVY! Especially because I see motherhood like you do. My child is not an accessory she is a human being who will be a functioning member of society one day with her own dreams, passions, thoughts, opinions, etc. It’s not something to take lightly! And it’s hard even with a decent partner because hey he’s still a man at the end of the day! And we know men will just NEVER GET IT!!! 🗣️😅 Everything about a mother’s life and body changes and men pretty much just get a new roommate that kind of looks like him and it’s absolute bullshit!  So definitely count the cost when it comes to bringing a human into this world. It’s incredibly hard but also so rewarding if it’s what you want to do. BUT ABSOLUTELY PRIORITIZE YOURSELF in the decision because once that baby is born you are no longer a priority to anyone including yourself!"
110,"24:56 “My success has nothing to do with you.” THAT’S why. For some men, it’s important to their ego that they can take some ownership of your success. If she’s less successful than me, I’ll take care of her. If she’s more successful than me, I better have had something to do with it or I’m not good enough."

I’m watching sex and the city for the first time and just finished season 2. I do this every time, start fourthwing, you’re slightly ahead, song of Achilles, and now this! Girl! And we all know I can’t skip because that’s a breach of law in the nation so I’m gonna have to binge the life out of this show to catch up and finish it before next week! 
P.S - Give a book A Little Life a go - harrowing and heartbreaking but real and true is the only way to describe it."
0,"Big is like a cigarette to Carrie. Something bad for her that she’s constantly craving. He is always hurting her and letting her down meanwhile she is always chasing her next “Big fix”.  They have such a cyclical relationship, just like her quitting smoking. When she is with Aiden she’s still sneaking around and trying to talk to Big and CHEATS on Aiden. I agree, Aiden would’ve been the best thing for her, but it’s not what she truly wants.  I love love love hearing your takes on SATC, pls keep talking about it. P.S I’m a Miranda/Samantha lol 💗"
0,"I was cooking in the kitchen but started SCREAMING at the statement ""I've never felt pretty""

0,Your type of country music is THE BEST type of country music lol. I grew up in Montana and country should be about su*cidal cowboys and cheating. And escaping prison with a hound dog chasing you. Or about being visited by satan in some form. Or about k*lling your boss. thats the true America 🇺🇸
0,"I wish more women understood your points about motherhood. People just pop them out and teach them to be horrible people or don't raise them. Also, we need to fix climate change before anyone else brings more people into this earth..."

0,i am offended by the lack of Jack O'Connell section
0,ALBUM ?!
0,I think everyone can enjoy SATC  but it should be a mandatory watch for women in their late 20s-early 30s. Stop dooming about getting older and allow yourself to be as confident and vibrant and imperfect as Carrie and the girls

0,18th century tea is so Brittnay coded

0,OKAY OPENING SONG I SEE YOU
0,"Idk really anything about Lord Byron but I don't think being a hedonist slut and loving nature are mutually exclusive haha. Maybe with how crazy his life and mind was, nature was the only solace. Maybe he loved nature _so_ much that he wanted to experience _all_ of it. I can kinda relate to that. Sluts love hiking too. lmao"

2,I started re-watching SATC. Hate to break it to you Supreme Leader but I LOVE Steve and always will! He’s so cute and sweet and is the key to soften Miranda’s hard exterior. Yes he is just a bartender but he loves her and has potential
0,"Everytime I watch Sex and the city the series, I am struck by how current it is. Like they really seem to be in the trenches with us 😂 the very first episode establishes it all - successful women, toxic bachelors, hopeful romantics, the idea of men being intimidated by successful women and them feeling the pressure to settle, the push and pull of being independent but still wanting connection... Just wow"
1,I literally watched o brother where art thou last night and then she starts the episode like that?! We are connected😌

0,Im glad someone said it!! What Steve did to her before that party at her firm will NEVER sit right with me
0,"Prepare yourself for the most laysbian thing ever but when my wife and I started dating she had gone back to school and I was a corporate girlie. We met playing roller derby and I bought her new skates before we got married because I love her and wanted to do that for her. I had the money and could do that for her so why not? And it was never this weird thing between us. We do things with love because we love each other, not because we want to hold it over the other person or keep score. The straights are NOT okay"

0,I went to a Montessori school from the ages of 5-14 (basically k-8) and honestly the schooling is amazing and better than the parenting because I was still able to be a kid but still be able to learn about the world in my way as well as my time like if I’m succeeding in math I won’t be held back because if the rest of the class is stuck I can keep going

So many are not in the right financial situation and then end up in poverty which easily leads to substance abuse and that’s yet another kid whose childhood is fucked, what kind of adult will he/she be??"

103,"Honestly your views on Motherhood is refreshing. I have felt that way for a long time; I literally have no maternal bone in me 😭 even when I was a toddler, other toddlers bugged me so much that I wanted to be alone XD and nothing has changed. Im happy I found a man that is indifferent about having kids. I want a calm quiet life with him❤️ I don't need to feel successful being a mother too, that just isn't for me! I'll always be an aunty but not a mom~

Also just listened to I Love You by Fontaines D.C and I am immediately hooked. Thank you Brittany 😍❤️"

0,"For the comments regarding getting work done on your face/body: I feel like this seems like something everyone is doing based on where you are and the people and industry you are around. I only know one person in my actual life that gets lip injections that isn’t in the industry. I think this is where people who say staying grounded and connected to your roots is so important. You’re obviously going to change throughout your life, but being an influence will always be more effective than being influenced. Sincerely, a 40 yr old woman with no work done 🌟"
0,"I feel like Miranda wouldnt have had the baby! As i watched and even now looking back, I don’t see why Steve was such a pressure point for her character (and like, I was in a very similar boat as she, romantically speaking until very recently)."
0,Carrie deserves to be happy and if she is happy in a more chaotic relationship then she deserves that. She was not as happy…💗💗💗
0,Bruh Aiden was gas lighting and weird
0,"cheating aside, aidan and carrie simply were too incompatible anyway"
0,I know it's going to be a good week when fearless leader starts the pod with some Ralph Stanley. In appalachia Ralph is a god ❤
11,"I feel like the purpose of Carrie essentially dicking around with Aiden and cheating was to show she truly was not ready to be in a committed relationship at that point in her life. She doesn't know what she wants which is why she keeps flying back and forth to wanting Big.  That's why she chickened out of wanting to marry Aiden. She needed to be alone and sit with it all and not immediately bounce to a new dude. In the end though she finds herself, she finds her true love which is her friends, and realizes she is ready for a relationship again. At least that's what I think."
8,This is an INSANE episode title lmfao here for it 110%
1,"I will say the reason for the “pretty and” statements is really because women for so long were only valued based off of their looks. So for modern “woke” day, it’s considered shallow and misogynistic to only comment on a woman’s appearance as her value. HOWEVER I totally get what you are saying that you want to feel pretty and desired and not have to rely 100% on personality to get a foot in the door."
0,"hot take … i think brittany should play clair obscure:expedition 33, i feel she would EAT THAT UP!!! gamers rise up 💀😂😂"
0,If she doesn't find out about John Keats and watch Bright Star I might freak out
0,"It's really not a weird dichotomy - rich ppl used to be interesting. You should look up William Vanderbilt II, and his Long Island home. His family was known for their trains and railroads, but he had a passion for marine biology.

Rich ppl nowadays just aren't made of the same schtuff"
0,also on a full rewatch of satc <3 also his name is literally just john how boring it's John Big

0,It’s insane how this GORGEOUS woman just GETS IT
0,I’ve had a Big in my life and omfg I hate big so much for just that reason. But ALSO Big calling Carrie “kid” 🤮 makes me sick. My Big in my life was a groomer to me so it just makes me grossed out
0,"the fact that you touched on the infamous Shockey AND opened with Oh Death, adds this to my favorite episodes list😭"

1,I relate so much to everything you say and your experiences I actually start hyperventilating and jumping on my chair.
0,"no joke i listened to that singing intro like 12 times, i need a recorded cover"
0,"the typical unemployed man carries an air of childlike whimsy that many of us women inherently possess, so we are drawn to it because they seem similarly harmless and fun. alas"
0,JUSTICE FOR AIDAN🚨
0,"You need to watch the SATC series, then the movies, then AJLT"
0,The sex in the city rant/appreciation is the biggest mood
0,"I think the thing about not wanting to get married (bearing in mind I haven't watched SatC) is that it's a serious legal step. You intertwine your finances, healthcare rights, assets, taxes, etc.. Romance or not, it IS a contract, a legal joining of your lives in the eyes of the state.

Depending on what happens and the choices of both partners throughout the years after will affect you BOTH equally, like draining savings or harming your personal property (because once you're married, unless you have a prenup, that's your JOINT property). That's whether or not you divorce down the line too. You need to be on the same page about those very real implications, not just about how much you love each other.

As I'm preparing to enter into my 30s and am trying to really build up my finances, I'm less ready to jump into something like marriage, even if my partner wants to. If i'm not ready and they still propose, that's sign that we aren't on the same page and need to communicate what's driving both of us in that moment.

Imo, I think a LOT of couples jump into marriage far too quickly without considering those financial and legal impacts. That's the kind of thing that leads to a messy divorce when they eventually split.

The Financial Diet has done some really interesting discussions about this topic over the years, if someone wants to listen to others talk about that topic."
0,I loved Aidan 😭😭😭
0,"BRITTANY YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO SEEN!!! 

As a kid I would chew off the hands, feets, ears and noses off my Barbie Dolls. I still want a chew toy."
0,"BRITTTT WATCH MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, Aiden’s character is everything and more!! ALSO! You covering sex in the city has made my whole life complete I’ve been obsessed with the show for over 10 years and I needed your input more than you know"
0,"I kinda wish weddings seemed more appealing to me. As a gay man, i really don’t care if i get married. My bf and I have been together for 11 years and neither of us have any interest in it. 

If we did, it would be like how my gay uncle and his husband got married. Just  at the courthouse privately."
0,I'm changing my name after this episode.
0,Thank GAWD mother finally started SATC. The Aiden freak out is so valid especially over a man named JOHN who can’t give an ounce of stability!!!!
0,The only nation that understands it's citizens so well ❤❤
0,"Heartbreaking, but understandable love u always Chris"
0,Mr. Big’s name is John 😂
0,"Why does you success threaten them? You said it youself, ""it has nothing to do with you."" How can they be the center of attention when you are your own person?"
1,"Carrie with Aidan is definitely ""women in mens fields"", what, with the cheating and the refusal to meet him half way."
0,I needed this episode today 🥹
0,I think O Death plays in the beginning of Until Dawn (and other Supermassive games?? I don’t remember for sure)
2,"idk, im sure i'll get eaten alive in the comments but this divine feminine pro marriage era is tiring. like, i too think Carrie fumbled Aiden but there are so many reasons that people don't want to get married and doing it just to make your partner happy is very toxic and strange. if your partner needs validation for your relationship from everyone in their life maybe thats a them thing. it also really glosses over the privilege that disabled people may not actually be able to marry without losing their benefits and the state coming after the assets of their spouse if they went into medical debt. not even to mention that traditionally marriage is an exchange of property. very disappointed that we're making something that hurts no one if both parties agree, into something that is wrong. you can totally wish Carrie had married Aiden but leave other people's relationships out of it."
0,Aidan Shaw crash out is so realllllllll also john corbett is the man
309,"aidan crashout  girl i get u, also her being so close to guessing big's name LMAOO"

0,Seeing this when I’m at the EXACT same point at the show 😜
0,2:24 nothing more real than the business casual in HS. I had those Clark’s Mary Jane’s and I thought I was really doing something.
0,Needing a plastic cooking set to suck on while I listen
1,"Arrived, your Grace."
0,"The people who dressed business casual at school were always the ones tryna prove something , trying too hard, making up for something"
1,"I think the situation with Aiden and Big shaped my view of relationships in a way where I want just peace and quiet and we both just wake up, cut bread, drink tea and chill, not the Carrie chaos extravaganza so I FEEL you girl, I also agree with your view on marriage, I think I also would marry Aiden lol, Sex and the City is one of my favorite tv series, it was so groundbreaking when I watched it first and even when a rewatched all of it a few years back"
0,"Aidan was the all American dream guy and Carrie was unfortunately very toxic. Separate note, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WATCH OR READ THE OUTLANDER SERIES!!! Girl you will not be disappointed it’s very romantic, it’s a period piece, and it’s about Scotland. I’m aware Ireland has your heart but you will not be sorry to consume Outlander I SWEAR by it 🙏"
1,"Supreme leader, I understand what you mean about wanting to feel pretty and letting that be enough. That feeling that you don’t have to rely on your brains, wit, personality, generosity to capture anyone’s attention or validation. I would just caution you to work on feeling enough even if you weren’t pretty (which you are, you are stunning). You deserve to be in every room you’re in, deserving of attention, validation, and love even if you lose all of those things that you think make you valuable. I hope I made my point clear, you don’t have to prove yourself in any way. You belong. 🫶🏼"
0,"i have a boyfriend and its the first time that its my partner who pays for stuff and thats weird for me too.
i think men in general simply are not taugh on how to accept this kind of generosity from a partner, even when its informed by self-interest."
2,"in the stall, one hand on the handicap rail, the other squeezing my phone, stomach rumbling, eyes closed, unclenched, tears in my eyes, god controlling the flow"

0,Donuts scared me again
0,as a Fontaines DC lover - I have been WAITING for Brittany to discover them. I knew she would love their music. this is my Roman Empire
2,Girly my mom is a flight attendant and Aiden (John Corbett) was on her plane. She said he is an Aiden in real life and gave her a copy of his CD. Of course I stole it from her because he's a BABE but it makes my heart settle knowing he is still Daddy <3

0,"my autistic nonverbal 3 year old is RARELY interested in toys, but he loooves his busy boards/switchboards. some of them don’t necessarily have switches but stuff like shoelaces, little locks, etc. 
Now however I will be throwing them all away due to the fear of him becoming a DJ"
29,"""its harrowing to to realize that you are Miranda"" hits too close to home"
132,"You talking about Miranda and Steve made me think of something my grandma always says- “You can love whoever you want as long as you can afford them” and the obvious context of this is money, but it’s also about having the available time & patience, or like how much is in your cup to fill theirs ( and how much they fill yours back). Ultimately we cannot run off a cup only filled 1/2 of the way forever, especially if we are giving away some of ours so that someone else can have a full cup. For Miranda and Steve she can easily afford the monetary expenses - what she can’t afford is to have the care or patience for him to work through his stupid insecurity. The money paired with the time and patience and compromise it takes to fill his cup leaves Miranda with an empty one."
8,why would i love to watch brittany watch Flushed Away lmaooooo i am dyinggggg
0,"You can’t just throw in Tracy’s “funky jewlry”, EYE NEED IT"

0,"intro is peak, can we get a real cover of O Death"
1,"The Steve slander is something I NEEDED omg I can’t withhold my anger I have for his character sometimes, everything you said about him and his relationship with Miranda is so spot on. Just wait babe just wait the anger will grow🤕 (watch the movies too!!!)"

0,Bring back infinity scarf and messy buns
2,"my hands are off the wheel, eyes are closed, prepared to dedicate my life to lord broski"
1,"The “unfortunately, the type of men that I like work in the service industry” rubbed me the wrong way, Brittany. The type of men that you described thereafter exist in literally any other industry, primarily in finance, law and acting, in my experience. That’s just someone who realized their charisma can be used to their advantage.

The fact that the people that you’ve been involved with were unemployed doesn’t have anything to do with the service industry, and your way of talking about it was very disappointing to me. I’m all for being strong and independent, but there’s no need to put other people down. Just don’t talk to men who are bad for you 🤷🏻‍♀️"
0,Had to stop after the first 30 seconds to go listen to the whole O Brother soundtrack thanks pookie
2,Starting with Oh Death and then talking abt Byron?!!! I am BEYOND LOCKED TF IN

0,"Girl, you are going to PERISH once you meet Carrie’s 3rd serious boyfriend, Berger. I had to turn the show off and go for a walk to get some air"
0,Watch SATC twice. Once you realize how everything turns out you see ALL THE RED FLAGS from day one in each episode
0,montessori kid from k3-8th grade here trigger warning next time queen 💔
2,Just finished my final exam —geography— finally on holiday and this came out!!!! Perfect timing as always supreme leader 😂❤
0,Finally the supreme leader is discussing a text I am intimately familiar with
6,"my hottest takes on satc are that carrie is so hated because she's incredibly relatable, aidan was not a good match for her (sorry brittany) and miranda definitely would have NOT kept that damn baby!! they really murdered her character throughout all the seasons"
2,just know that the SATC movies are terrible and atrocious but at the same time beautiful and amazing and works of art
0,"Montessori child here :p Montessori curriculums emphasize the ""open concept"" classroom, and strive for ""natural"" concepts whether it's the learning space itself (like wood materials), or actually being outside. We had gardening classes, and had small goats and pigs on the school grounds. Fun fact: Maria Montessori was the one that introduced the idea of child sized items for kids In the classroom!"
0,Opening up with O Death?! Hell yeah.
0,Getting serenaded by Brittany at 10 in the morning while at work is the best way to live
0,Sex and the City is a good show but the REBOOT......THE REBOOT!?!?!? Is a dumpster fire. And as much as you may like Miranda now (same) she is the WORST PERSON in And Just Like That. The new show is so so so shit.
0,being mad about Carrie and Aidan is so real
0,Me at work listening to this and when she screamed I literally yelped bc it scared me hahhahaha
0,"Oh man, the fuxkin Aidan arc taught me so much. I realized I was walking down a Carrie Bradshaw path and got my ass to therapy 😅 Carrie is an IDIOT."
1,This was the bestttt episode. I also watched SATC for the first time at 29. It’s the PERFECT age to watch the show. It’s such an amazing story of friendship. We team Aiden out here on god
0,"i don't think the suit thing would have been ok had the genders been reversed. edit : like,,,,, never heard of a gold-digger?"
0,i think everyone agrees aidan is the absolute best
0,As someone from the UK it was so funny to hear her talk about Clark’s
0,I have never been lucky enough to find that kind of girl friendship love. It’s so lonely out here.
0,"Im like Carrie Bradshaw w a back brace on, I been carrying you bitches now for way too long 🥱"

0,So glad U came acrossed your content. I grew up watching Sex & the City but before streaming so ive never watched in order. Putting it on my watch list.
2,"All of the SATC women have their flaws and strengths, and I think we all have a bit of each of them in us."
0,HANDS OFF THE WHEEL SHEEPLE
0,You need to get to And Just Like That!
2,I feel like the scene where Steve gets upset about the suit isnt as much about being threatened by her success and more about the difference in class between them. Steve was working class and Miranda was a manhattan white collar lawyer. They didn’t understand each other
0,"The way Aiden was hotter, cooler, nicer, loving than John drives me fucking crazy"
0,"as a trans guy with a masculine wired brain due to heavy influence growing up i really am a bit jealous seeing sisterhood, it was something i wanted as a kid but never understood it…i do have girl friends, majority of them…but i don’t really have that sisterhood experience and i envy it a bit. most of my friends and i text once a month at best but that’s why i love this podcast, it gives me that sense of what i was missing, ty for that"
0,I highly disagree with your take on Steve which probably is further proof we are both Miranda
0,Aidan frustrates me because he’s a bad communicator (and so is Carrie!) but together it’s a wash
0,"to answer the accent question, my dad was born and raised in the midwest before moving to London in his 20s. He's lived here for like 18-19 years at this point and has an English accent. so yes you would develop one it just might take a minute"
0,Don’t even waste your time watching the 2nd SATC movie!
1,"I think Carrie's character is a very untalked about type of woman: shes never satisfied with the things she has, she thinks theres always a next thing to move onto, a new hit if dopamine, but it's not like that in romance. She never found someone as good as him and she doesn't fully realize how good of a thing she passed over out of FOMO."
0,"Got fired yesterday from a 2 year job with absolutely no warning, no notice, no goodbye, they literally made me come in on a Monday, work a full day while being in pain, and fired me for my attitude and absences (i am disabled and literally work part time) just a rant. Thank you Brittany, I’m really glad that you are my escape."

33,"Season 5 is the first season SATC filmed after 9/11 and you can really feel the tonal shift of the show, I find it very interesting"
0,I had a Big for a long time. It’s staying with him because it has romantic drama you see on TV. And I gave up toxic soul ties and cleaned out my mental on what my priorities are. I found my Aidan. He wants to give me the world but I was so used to being in my masculine and this Aidan I have is showing me to relax and let him take care of me. Putting me in my feminine. It takes a lot of shedding your masculine coat of arms to allow for an Aidan to love you. But choosing Aidan is choosing a peaceful partner.
0,Goodmorning!
0,"I studied in London for 3 months when I was 20 and I realized when I came home to the states I had started saying a few words differently, like with a slight british inflection.

0,Please tell me you've seen o brother where art thou
0,Brittany. Your negative projection onto men will keep you single forever. I love you but its so obvious to me. Deep down you dont want to decenter men... You want one man where you both center each other. This anti men rhetoric will keep all of them away
0,"You said Sex and the city and I came a running. We are all mad at Carrie for choosing big sorry, we are. His names is John James Preston, there is a brief clip in i think season 6 where you see his name on the phone but in the first SATC movie you learn his full name."

1,"Re: marriage/ Carrie and Aiden - I think Carrie ultimately knew that they weren’t compatible. There was so much that felt she had to hide or change in order to make Aiden like her (whether that’s fair to Aiden or not), and that wasn’t sustainable forever and ever. And yeah, I think Big was always the one she wanted but he didn’t want her the same way. Aiden just got caught in the crossfire and it makes me so angry. He knew who he was, what he wanted, what he needed in a partner, and Carrie wanted to be picked. 

I love Carrie, despite her flaws - I think she’s a complex character but Aiden deserved to be left alone."

1,"27:15 I was literally introduced once as the girl with the great personality. I was mortified. The guys at this party were dogs. The girls were f*cking jackals. It was an awful night, to say the least. And, I'm f*cking beautiful. But, the other girls I was with looked like models. The only time in my life I have ever felt like that... so ashamed to just look like me. And, ashamed of the company I was with too. It was a learning night."

0,"Hello youtube nation, I am reporting as an ambassador from the spotify listening group. I don't usually sound off in the comments but SATC is indeed a special interest of mine and spotify comments are lame. I have watched through the show ten times in its entirety and just NEEDED to add my take on Aidan and Steve here but before that you were close on guessing Big's name brittany..... its John LOL 

1. Aidan. This is my less polarizing opinion of the two so I will start with him. In the canon of SATC, Carrie justifies her going after Big repeatedly as ""daddy issues"". Carrie had a father leave her at a young age in the SATC universe (although in the carrie diaries ""prequel"" it was the opposite but I like to think of the carrie diaries almost as an alternate universe because so so much is different). I think daddy issues is kind of a cop out explanation but it does play into why i think she couldn't commit to aidan. Carrie has SEVERE attachment/abandonment issues, and Mr. Big feeds into them in the most toxic way by giving her what she believes she deserves which is inconsistency. I also think that Carrie struggles to see herself as worthy of a guy like Aidan and her cheating was a self sabotage in that way. I dont think this justifies her level of doing MY BOYFRIEND dirty (because Aidan is my boyfriend i am sorry you had to find out this way) but I also think Aidan dodged a bullet. Carrie was HIS Mr Big and just like she was willing to with big, aidan was willing to give himself and his values up for her. If Aidan had stayed with Carrie, he wouldn't have been able to have children, go to the cabin, or ever move out of the city and have a slower life. I think Carrie knew that he would give that up and knew that in marrying him she would've eventually need to start compromising the way he was for her to not be an awful partner. Which this gets down to the real tea that Carrie didn't love Aidan, she loved the person she could've been with him and the way that he loved her but she didnt love him truly and purely in the way she loved Big (that part i will never understand).

2. Steve. I didn't know this was polarizing until tiktok got ahold of this show but I love Steve.... HERES WHY!!!! In my mind, Miranda only was able to let go of the high expectations she had for herself when she was with steve because he didn't care if she was partner at her firm he just cared that she was happy. I think Miranda might have worked herself into the ground if steve wasn't there to give her the permission to slow down that she would've never given herself. As for the suit scene, yes steve was an asshole. If i am remembering correctly this is the only time he struggles with the different tax brackets they are in. I think the way he took it out on her was definitely fucked but I can understand why men struggle with that. Men who were raised traditionally (like steve, catholic and conservative) were taught their only contribution that is worthwhile is through providing. This is obviously not true but I think that conditioning takes time to undo and I think Miranda was the first to challenge him on those beliefs he had held his whole life. After working through that he really does embrace her drive and love for her career and in conclusion steve and miranda make each other better and challenged each other in a positive way. 
.... okay last thing, I know steve had poo marks in his underwear and this did move him down in my ranking as one of my favorite love interests, i dont have a defense for that one but I accept him despite it."

1,"Good episode! However I would say that any historian would credit the USSR as the primary reason for winning the war. To credit Americans as THE reason is just not true. I’d recommend learning more about the eastern front and the numbers of troops deployed and sacrificed by the USSR to defeat the axis. I say this as an American. 

The losses all the allies suffered pale in comparison to the USSRs. USSR mobilized 35 million troops compared to USAs 16 million.  The USSR constituted 65% of all deaths on the allies sides, USA just 2%. 

I know you were not disregarding the other Allies on purpose, but that is how it came off when you stated that the USA is the reason ww2 was won. Hope this info was informative and helpful ❤ great episode otherwise!"

First of all a lot of women in history have started wars, and even if you try to argue that it was bc of the patriarchal structure of society that they were influenced to do so, I would still say that War, is about Taking. And everyone can be greedy, and ambitious to the point of only looking for their own self interest. That's not a male trait, that's a human trait."

Nowadays, that has become impossible, as you have become so hateful and hypocritical. We don't know what is happening in your life, and we don't know how to help. We just want the very best for you, but you must remember that no one can help you if you don't help yourself. We really look forward to revisiting your content after a little while, and hope to see a much happier Brittany, who we miss very dearly."

12,"I love this podcast and show with all my heart but to say that “the Americans really won the war for the allies” is a HUGE oversimplification of history and as someone whose family came from the Soviet Union, I do find that statement discomforting because the Soviet Union played a massive role (if not the biggest) in WW2. From 1941 the USSR was doing the majority of fighting against Nazis in Europe. About 75–80% of the entire German army was sent to fight the USSR on the Eastern Front. 

The Eastern Front was where the bulk of the war in Europe was actually fought. Around 80% of all German military deaths happened there. The Red Army took on the overwhelming majority of the German Wehrmacht and eventually broke their back, pushing their way to Berlin. Battles like Stalingrad and Kursk were among the largest and bloodiest in human history, and they were won by the Soviets at an immense cost.

Once the U.S. did join the war it did help significantly with resources. But, The U.S. during this time in 1941 entered WW2 after pearl harbour (and bombing Japan). The U.S. and Britain focused much of their early effort in the Pacific against Japan and on smaller European campaigns, but the massive land war against Germany in Europe was mainly fought by the USSR until the Western Allies opened a major front in 1944. 

The Soviet Union lost over 20 million people in the war. For them, what happened to the U.S. at Pearl Harbor was happening every day for years. And still, they fought back, pushed the Nazis out of their country, and marched all the way to Berlin. It was the Red Army that broke the Nazi war machine in Europe. The U.S. helped a lot, especially later in the war, but the Soviet Union put everything they had into that fight—and they paid the highest price. 

This comment isn’t intended to criticise, but to offer a more well rounded perspective. HISTORY DESERVES NUANCE and not to be merely fed through a western focused lens."
0,This episode was especially unhinged 😭😭😭😭
0,i love this woman <3
0,38:58 I think Emma Corrin pronouns are they/them ! :)
0,"Brittany, if you’re interested in the British special forces and WW2 history in general, I highly recommend researching about Operation Anthropoid. It was the only successful government-backed assassination of a member of Nazi high command during the war by a heroic group of Czech paratroopers, trained by the British special forces, who sacrificed themselves trying to free their country from occupied rule. An amazing and tragic story."

0,we had to read Unbroken the book in 8th grade as a NYS student- it was not for the feint of heart lol but if the school board thought it was ok for middle schoolers- i think you can do it queen!!!!
0,"I know we are talking about the British during WWII, but if y'all get the chance to check out The WASP, Women Airforce Service Pilots! They were the first women to fly military aircrafts. They helped train men pilots, towed target (basically flew a target for ground men to shoot at), ferried planes, test planes, transported cargo. While they did not see combat, 38 women died in service from crashes resulting from faulty planes, flight accidents, etc. To top it all off, while they trained exactly like the male troops, they were classified as civilians. Meaning they did not receive any military honors or benefits. They paid for their way to Avenger Field in Sweetwater, TX and from. uniforms (they were given old men flight suits, that did not fit them so they had to get creative), and their barracks. The military did not pay for anything, even for the 38 bodies to return home. The women would come together and pool money to get their bodies back to their families. When the war began to slow down, there was a smear campaign to close the program as male pilots wanted their jobs back as they were not needed over seas. Sadly, the campaign worked and closed the program down (1942-1944). The women were told to pack up, go home, and their records were sealed, as if nothing happened. Years later in the 1970s the Air Force (Spelling of Airforce and Air Force is different as the Air Force was not organized till 1947. The WASP were under the Army.) began training women for pilots and inaccurately claimed it was ""the first time women had flown military planes."" WASP, KOWs (Kin of WASPs), and congress supporters like Senator Barry Goldwater (he ferried planes alongside them) fought this claim. Finally in 1977, Jimmy Carter finally granted the WASP veteran status. In 2009, they were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President Obama. Their fight didn't stop there as WASP Elaine Harmon was denied burial at Arlington National Cemetery. Her granddaughter, Erin Miller, led a grassroots campaign to help get support to get the law passed in 2016. She has a really good book, Final Fight, Final Flight that details the fight. 
The current administration removed training materials with The WASP in the Air Force and the Pentagon has removed online content about The WASP, Tuskegee Airman, and other minorities. many of these posts are now lost."

0,Watch the ministry of ungentlemanly warfare
1,We had to read Unbroken in 8th grade and it changed me fundamentally. War forever terrifies me because the level of detail the book goes into on the horrors of being a prisoner of war in Japan during WW2 is shocking.

Jack O'Connell in sexy fisherman sweaters in the 1850's on a whaling ship in the Arctic Ocean. 
Cinematically beautiful and filmed on location. Collin Ferrell is also in it and plays a character so diabolical it made me feel sick to my stomach.
I repeat, 1800's Jack O'Connell in dirty fisherman sweaters on a whaling ship. 
May the good lord bring this comment to you."

0,as a flight attendant the opening of this episode is too true 😔
0,"I don't know if Brittany will ever see this, but I'm begging you girl, please watch 'The Hollow Crown' TV miniseries. It's an of adaptation of Shakespeare's history plays: Richard II, Henry IV: Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V with Tom Hiddleston, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anton Lesser (Qyburn in GoT), and Patrick Stewart. I feel like you would absolutely eat it up and be obsessed."
0,"Brittany! I need you to read Jacqueline Harpman’s “I Who Have Never Known Men.” 

IMO it should be a classic added to school curriculum. One of the underlying themes hits on your opinion that war and violence would never exist in a world run by women. 

If you read it, PLZ do a deep dive during a broski report!

0,"Brit here, here's a (imo) accurate representation of the BBC channels:
BBC One - broadest target audience, news (every morning, evening, night), biggest budget shows (Peaky Blinders, Doctor Who, Sherlock, Luther, SAS Rogue Heroes), biggest budget documentaries (Planet Earth, Planet Earth 2, Asia), long running comedy panel shows, reality competition shows (Traitors, the Apprentice, Race Across the World, Masterchef), occasionally TV premieres of recent blockbusters
BBC Two - slightly more niche audience, lots of period dramas and historical documentaries, more highbrow quiz shows, nature and garden shows, music shows and documentaries
BBC Three - young target audience, LGBTQ+ content (Drag Race, Glow Up, gay dating shows), social political documentaries (Louis Theroux, Stacey Dooley), celebrity-led content, original comedy, YA dramas, US imports (Gossip Girl, Pretty Little Liars)
BBC Four - I think its an older target audience, tends to rerun old original series, arts and culture (art, ballet, prerecorded stage productions), some international dramas
Basically, BBC 1 is for the whole family, BBC 2 is for music and history fans, BBC 3 is for pop culture followers, BBC 4 is for your nan"
0,"I’ve been reading a book called “a long road to freedom, the life of Patrick mc crystal” that was written about my dad’s uncle and found out that he served under general montgomery for a time. Patrick mc crystal was a northern Irish soldier who joined the army at 17 before world war 2 kicked off and he got swept up in it for the long haul. I haven’t finished it yet but it’s devastating stuff. Maybe you’d enjoy it since it relates to two of your special interests, Ireland and WW2."

0,Had to read Unbroken for school. HATED ittttt
1,"14:53 It's my first time knowing about these special ops as someone from north africa , specifically egypt. The glaring hypocrisy is that while control over north africa aided in the war, the countries themselves and the citizens treated it like occupation and colonization which it was. People were taken off the streets and from their homes and forced to become soldiers , and to then be shipped off to the war front. There was a silent war in the country at the time. people were not concerned about world war two as they were about their war with british occupation."

0,"Dearest supreme leader,
I, a mere peasant in the great nation of the Broski, humbly suggest that one should read “Johnny Got his Gun” by Dalton trumbo, it is truly a masterpiece. 

In all seriousness this book is amazing, and dives into the mind of a severely wounded soldier, it lowkey changed my life."
0,In my theater world we do shows that secretly make the audience uncomfortable in one way or another about a way of life/thinking etc and that’s because theater is ment to make people think and reflect about life and society
1,brittany how could u forget key glock 😭😭😭
0,Sing Sing is not a movie that is meant to be compared to Good Will Hunting or Finding Forrester; although I can understand where they collied. It's a movie about reformation and growing beyond the constraints of your situation and what society expects of you.

0,she raised her ya ya ya singing this is real
0,the BigX name drop shook me to my core
0,"Brittany, in relation to your interests in learning about wars and the power of media I highly suggest you research 'soft power' versus 'hard power'.

0,"i always think you on the iron throne is Remy Bond, once you see it you can never unsee it <3"
0,Leader Broski honestly you should never watch unbroken. I watched it when it came out at the ripe age of 12 and have never been the same.

0,"If anyone is interesting in viewing the current play “Goodnight, and Good Luck”, it will be aired LIVE on CNN on Saturday, June 7th!!"
0,"Girl… the Americans did not win WWII for the Allies — the Soviets did 💀 to say otherwise is truly ahistorical. The Americans essentially held out until the very end, swooped in, killed a bunch of Japanese civilians, and claimed victory on their backs alone. It wasn’t until the Red Scare propaganda campaigns in the 50s, 60s and 70s that public perception — even in the US — was more swayed to the Americans having the biggest role in victory. Highly recommend the film Come and See about the Eastern front, the sacrifice of the Soviet people (to the total of 27 million dead), and how they defeated fascism on the European continent."
0,I took the same quiz as Brittany while watching and I got Olenna Tyrell
0,YOU HAVE TO WATCH UNBROKEN!!! its so good!!!

0,"WATCH UNBROKEN!! And read the book too, so so good."
0,"I strongly disagree with war being an only male thing. There have been plenty of females who were “forced” to go to war (by there circumstances) and glorified it. Such as cleopatra. Her military prowess was a pride for her and her country. Not to glorify war, but there have definitely been woman who had mastered warfare. Modern war tho, is a different story. None of it is necessary it’s all based on greed."

0,As someone DEEP in medical board exam studying and VIOLENT stomach flu…thank u for making my day sm better
0,"27:18 On the topic of McCarthyism (which some historians say pushed american entry into the korean war mind you), there are SOOOO many parallels between the fearmongering around communism in the fifties and what is being spouted in the US now around a monolithic 'wokeness' from the left. Those that supported McCarthy at the time attacked federal libraries for exhibiting ""radical works"" that supposedly promoted communist ideals (one of which being Huckleberry Finn); in essence books were being banned and censored, not too dissimilarly from what is happening now around topics of LGBT issues institutional racism. 

Its not surprising really, if you look at history. This new wave of fear is just an evolution of the old ones around communism, they have the exact same roots of leftism, which (according to the right) threatens the family and the Church - in the exact same way communism did. This is VERY clear when you look at how people who were accused of communism in the '50s were also commonly investigated for homosexuality, as they were seen as interlinked. Fear doesn't go away, it simply changes forms."

0,Look up indian Sikh troops fighting for Nazi Germany. My grandfather lived in a town were some of them were stationed and they were highly respected and liked. Some of them even stayed and married german women. This would blow alot of peoples mind because the image of german society back then is portraied in an almost cartoonish way in the media. ALOT of things were different than people think.

1,"Majority of historians outside of America and also a lot in America agree the Soviets won the war for the allies. The Russian front was a meat grinder, the Soviets suffered truly mind boggling casualties in order to sap the Nazis of men and resources. If the Nazis hadn't invaded Russia, they would have faced the US at full fighting capacity and who knows what would have happened then. Crazy how many Americans have no idea about the Soviet side of the war! But also not surprising lol"

10,"girl I love you so much and waiting for every single episode but why do all americans only talk about the US and the UK when it comes to the WW2?? despite the politics and how things flipped, around 30 millions Soviet soldiers fell back then which is 15 times more than those two allies’ losses combined. for four years people had been dying, eating wallpapers from hunger and losing all of their family members. the movie “Come and See” is the most horrific and realistic one about it. 

maybe it’s the tense political relationships with, first, the USSR and then Russia nowadays but it doesn’t change the fact that no help would be needed from the US without the Eastern front – there would be nobody to give a hand to."

6,"Britney; as an honorary British lady I feel like you really need to watch This Is England. Channel 4 movie later adapted into a 3-season TV show which stars Jack O’Connell and Stephen Graham. Jack didn’t end up in the series due to scheduling conflicts (I still mourn to this day) but it’s very very good. It is gritty, shocking and does contain some very triggering scenes but sheds light on life in 1980s Northern England and the political unrest at the time (Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, there are heavy themes of poverty and racism). Definitely worth a watch if you want to see some of Jack’s earlier work, although it’s not a major role of his."

0,"""Analyze how this house contributes to an interpretation of this work as a whole"" In House of the Rising Sun"" by The Animals, there is no concrete meaning of this house. In the way that this ""house' is sung, it could possibly be a true place, most likely a gambling bar, due to the lyrics explaining that the father was a gambler in new orleans where ""the house"" is also explained to be. Also, in this song, the house is explained as ""a ruin of many a poor boy,"" and then later a lyric says ""oh mother tell your children/to not do what I have done/to spend your life in pain and misery/in the house of the rising sun."" Which could simply mean an emotional or mental state of being."

0,"Honestly, her male obsession is insanely scary. Like, at nearly 30 years old, it’s too much girl. The obsession is too much. If I were those male actors, I would genuinely be frightened for my safety. It’s giving, Jennifer Anistons stalker. Also weird the main point you made about the movie Sinners was about the Irish guy. Not like, the whole ass plot of the movie. Not very AAVE inclusive tbh. Pretty typical for someone friends with that Drew Arufulu psycho."

Cars is a car making friends and succeeding despite his bumpy but privileged path to fame in my eyes. When you describe the meaning behind it all, my jaw was dropped, it all made sense but I never would have seen it. Gonna get a diagnosis soon!"

0,"Supreme leader we get it, scream singing along to all the Aladdin with you (this is my 5th listen)"
1,"Hi Brittany,
I’m not sure if you’ll ever see this but today I found myself crying while watching an old episode of Broskination, which lead to a full meltdown. Likely bc my period is coming and life has been hard. You said something along the lines of “we all want connection, even if it’s bad” and that hit home. For a while I’ve been in a situationship that is bad for so many reasons and I can’t find the strength to walk away. And today I’m here hoping he texts me back and trying to hide my crazy and you came to mind. I am so happy I found your podcast, thanks to Trixie, and I just think you could be a great friend or life coach. I’d pay to have a zoom call with you and hear your thoughts on some of my forks in the road. Any way really just wanted to tell you thank you & though I don’t personally know you I have so much love and respect for your being & your work. 
❤️ Marissa"

0,"On the suject of d32th...
Firstly - the tunnel talk...
A shocking, ""plot-twist"", for your consideration - at the process of dying, a fatally compromised/stressed brain, switches on the Saturday morning cartoon equivalent of a visual/auditory survival ""babysitter""-reel, a long-long-LONG time beforehand prepared/pre-composed ""the best of""-collage of the person's life, or for the less imaginative of us - a lit tunnel of sorts - a visual scenario, that's been spoon-fed to us all countless times, by countless media sources, whilst brain, the organ, is just a tad busy trying to keep all the important bodily process' plates ""spinning"". It's infinitely ironic, that even our own brain knows, that when the  sh!t truly hits the fan, staying alive wise, our conscious selves need to be ""handled"" aka put on a hold, staring at a ""we'll be back momentarily...""-screen-saver, complete with elevator-music. 😏
Death is an absolute line. A vast part of humanity have this ""shockingly"" grandiose/self-flattering notion, that we can, quote-on-quote, ""jump"" over and back over it. - We can't. What it actually is, that we assume to be said ""magical ability"", is just extreme stress-hallucinations, at the process of dying. 
Death is nothingness, and claiming to have ""memories of death"", de facto disqualifies even a theoretical chance of them being ""memories of death"", because memories aren't nothing - they are something. Death is non-being. You can't remember ""not being"", and if you are ""remembering"" it, then you de facto ""were"", in order to be able to remember it, and thus wasn't ""not being"", because you wouldn't exist to remember it, if you had been. Yes - death is a mind-phuck to explain, but easy to understand, given if humanity's ego would allow it to collectively accept it's true prosaic nature - we start being, we are and we unceremoniously stop being. Obviously, it's unacceptable to our species - because we are FAR too ""special/important"" for that, so we hysterically cling to archaic religious fantasies and empty pomp to calm ourselves... in 2024... still...👀👀👀🙄😏 ...as if it makes death's true nature any less true. Water's still wet and fire burns, what ever comforting lies you feed yourselves... 👀🙄😏
On the subject of ""after life"" - lets start with a detailed descrption of everyone's ""before life"". I mean, by that logic we surely all lived it already,  r-i-g-h-t?... So a it really shouldn't be a problem, no?... 👀👀👀😏
Only those who are ignorant of death's true nature, are afraid of it. Death is nothingness aka nothing, a state of infinite completely oblivious non-being, so to say one is 'afraid of death' is to actually to say that 'one is afraid of nothing'. By saying it, you actually state the opposite.
Death is the ultimate freedom, a paradox in which everything is nothing and nothing is everything. A state of all-knowingness and all-beingness, without the self-awearness of consciousness. The briefest moment, extending to infinity. Human laguages fail of describing it's true being and any ""ability"" our primitive minds are capable of imagining up, beyond pales in comparison. We don't even comprehend, that to ""fear death"" is to fear nothingness aka nothing, is de facto admitting to ""fear nothing"" aka not fear fear death. You can't fear something, that's not anything. 
State of non-conscious infinite non-being is the truest form of freedom there is, AND I can tell you exactly how that feels like. It feels like the seemingly a moment that takes you to pass 10-12 hours of dreamless sleep, when you're very tired. That 10+ hours fitting moment of completely oblivious sense of self. Being dead is that, put just prolonged into infinity. 

The religious are the cowards - afraid of reality, and the true nature of our prosaic human existence, as homo sapiens, to such pathetic degree, that thousands of years old, ridiculously absurd fear-enabling fairytales are still believed as canon. The religious are an EMBARRASSMENT. It brings me joy that the absolute nothingness of death will still take you all in the end, regardless of the fact, that all of you will have had wasted your lives, lying to yourselves, that there's a ""paradise""... a ""hell""... or a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g at all, after. My only regret is that I can't witness each of your disappointment, and that you can't experience said disappointment, because in the absolute nothingness of death, it is an impossibility, for it would be something, instead of nothing."

0,To add onto the cuisine topic around minute 38. We have similar recipes in the African-American community here due to slavery. The slaves would get the scraps or the entrails from animals after the owners were done with them and we have learned how to make recipes from that. Can learn more on Netflix from high on the hog series.

I had really been wanting them and my husband got them for me for Valentine's a few years ago. Croissant is a Kahki Campbell and Eclair is a Swedish Blue. We get an egg a day from each one, though they stopped laying during the winter. They're an absolute trip to watch run around the yard, and they eat the bad bugs that monch on my vegetable garden. One small con: they're pretty loud. I think our neighbors may hate us."

0,Hey Charlie is listed as a fool or a silly person. So if you've ever had a charlie horse you know that it's like a brain freeze and it makes you literally start flailing your leg around trying to get the freaking crap out because it's so overpowering like it literally makes your brain freeze up and it's all you can think about like you can't talk or even breathe sometimes LOL until the cramp goes away
0,It's called a charlie horse because when it cramps up it makes you bend your leg like a horse and when it is bent like that you oftentimes stretch it backwards like a horse kicking or put it forward. And the movement you put it in makes it literally look like a horse when it runs

0,"0:18 Ah here. Like- I just. The way... I am genuinely tweaking bc I grew up with this song (🇮🇪) and now I'm hearing it the whole time from a crowd of yanks on tiktok bc of a horror movie...

Also, Irish accents are notoriously difficult for Americans. Unless you're doing a specific dublin accent, (theres like four) it's generally not nasally at all and the tongue stays relaxed. Go for a general midlands accent. They're mild and more relaxed by comparison. Or go for a Derry accent bc there's a pattern and more consistent rhythm for you to copy.  Stay away from Mayo and Dublin."

I usually get maybe 1 ad on this podcast but last week and this week I got 5 ads both videos…and according to the time stamp it was 1 ad about every 8 minutes. It makes trying to listen to a podcast so annoying when every 8 minutes I get interrupted by those stupid shooting game ads
0,"Brittany your analysis were incredible however, you would get zero points for them as they are off task. The prompt asked for works of literature and you provided movies as examples. Other than that they were great!"
0,"Brittany, once again, is the old lady in a show/play SMH"
0,We need that guy from love on the spectrum on royal court!!!!
0,"BRITTANY i think if you were to learn about the history of mathematics, you would love it at least a little :)"

I speak Mexican Spanish ik u speak Spain Spanish which are pretty similar, but I am specifically fascinated by different Latin American dialects too. Not just the slang but official words for everyday objects"

134,"literally been on the verge of tears all day (mmm yummy pre-period emotions!!) and i just got home from another fuckass day of highschool and the first thing i get to do is make a little pizza, open my laptop to do my history homework, and pop on Brittany’s pod.

1,Are we being sponsored by Dunkin?
0,The linguini bit killed me
1,"Hey Brittany! Have you ever heard the Newfoundland accent? It's similar to the Irish accent! They have unique traditions and sites (screeched in, icebergs, jelly bean houses, music, mummers, slang, fun town names, geological features, wildlife - just to name some) which might be fun to look up for one of the pod topics or just for yourself :) There's also the Come from Away musical, which is about when Gander took in the redirected flights on 9/11. I lived in Newfoundland for a few summers doing geological fieldwork and got to visit a lot of the island. It's beautiful there and I met some of the friendliest people. The community the towns have is also something like I've never experienced, it's truly a special place. Just thought this might build on your Irish fixation, if you didn't already know about NL <3"
1,Yes the Louis Tomlinson biting meme is real I remember it 💀
0,"I don’t like when people say math doesn’t take creativity. The entire world is based around math, learn about elliptical geometry and you’ll change your mind. It takes brains but it also takes a critical thinker."

2) did you get a Dunkin’ sponsorship or something 😂😂
3) I didn’t pass all of my AP tests 😖😖
4) are you moving bc where did all of the items on ur desk go?"
0,"Yeah, with Irish, you gotta pick a hyper-specific accent, down to the 1.5 square km in the town, region, city, etc. That's when it'll be the most believable. You already know this, but it's worth saying: the more generalized the accent, the less believable it generally is. Love to you, Supreme Leader. Can't wait to have an episode entirely in Gaelic!!"

0,Miss Brit girl and don’t hate me…. But are we projecting a lil bit onto lightning McQueen?
0,"To respond to the first AP prompt: I'd say that Batman is also an example of a character that finds something that he lacks.
Based within the comics, Bruce Wayne, a family inheritor of a rich, wealthy family, loses a major piece of his life when his parents are gunned down in Gotham. 
Throughout his whole mission as Batman, Bruce Wayne is searching for not only vengeance but also ways to restore Gotham just as Thomas and Martha Wayne did. 

Even though Bruce Wayne is very rich and famous, and Batman has successfully suppressed the crime rate in Gotham, he still feels empty. Everything changes when Bruce Wayne attends a circus performance for the Flying Graysons, but unexpectedly watches the Flying Graysons fall to their deaths in a acrobatics accident, and their son Dick Grayson is left alone as an orphan. Bruce Wayne feels sympathy for Dick Grayson, decides to adopt him as his ward, and eventually help Dick Grayson become the first Robin.

Batman is a character that, albeit has so much fortune and acclaim as Bruce Wayne, finds something that he lacks throughout a major portion of his life: A family. I believe Batman has 4 adopted children and one biological child at this point. A cute note is that even Catwoman is considered a part of the Bat Family with her multiple instances of dating the Dark Knight, too. Batman was robbed of having parents at an early age, so he became the father figure to the Robins who needed one. 🖤🤍🦇🥹"
0,Around 45:00 I wonder if she's talking about Charli XCX 👀 She seemed so uninterested and rude the whole time. Not the type of person who meshes well with FUN

0,Brittany answering the AP lit Q3 prompt from last year with Cars the movie is not at all what I was expecting from this episode
343,The house prompt made me immediately think of Monster House. The severe trauma of grief that make the house become the person who died inside is so powerful. The fact that Nebbercracker becomes a hermit to take care of constance’s ghost rather than assimilate himself back into society because of constance’s hatred of children. UGH. so good.

0,"Local ecologist here, girl you should get into taxonomy because each organism has a scientific name for its Genus and species, and it’s all in Latin so usually the name will pertain to different features or areas where the organism lives. An example is Castor canadensis (btw it should be italicized or underlined) which is for the American beaver, Castor means beaver and canadensis is Canada, so it is means beaver of Canada. There is also a lot of rules for scientific names, the Genus name must be capitalize and the species name should be lowercase. Also the scientific name should be italicized or underlined to be correct. Also sometimes it’s just funny because the Bison’s scientific name is just Bison bison lol"

1,"I can actually speak about the duck shows. My dad raised birds his whole life and mine since he was 16. He raised ducks and eventually pigeons, budgies, doves, canaries, etc. I have been to many bird shows in my life. I'm from michigan and we would go to Ohio for them. They are basically not like a dog show, they don't show off tricks, but they do get judged. You can bring birds to sell, to put in a showcase to get judged and sometimes you win sometimes you don't. Other times other people would sell guinea pigs, rabbits, ducks. My grandpa bought a duck from there and Jesus christ I hated the car ride home. I don't know if my dad won anything before but they judge their wings, their breed sorta, their beak, talons, etc."

526,"6th grade ELA teacher and former AP Lit & Comp exam taker here! Your analysis of Lightning McQueen and the complexity behind what hes really missing was beautifully worded. When he first came to Radiator Springs, he didn't understand why after all these years the cars didn't move away, despite the innovative infrastructure that had diverted cars away from Radiator Springs. After time he realized that surrounding himself with cars who had transferable experiences really opened his eyes to the slow life. When McQueen met Doc, he became inspired and I would even say a little jealous because even though Doc had the fame and fortune for his time, what he had that McQueen didn't was community. McQueen understood after spending the time with everyone that they all contributed to something and relied on one another to survive. McQueen's ego put himself above those who liked their simple life because he internally longed for that. I loved how you pulled in Maslows Hierarchy of Needs! It ties in great with McQueen's story."
