And to have him pulling 6's after a little hookin, man TONS of guys would run away.....he had a few mins and some real punchers telling  him how to deal with it and he did.....a little surprised how they let Ty wrap on just his 3rd real bull.

76,"Native Texan here, lived in Fort Worth for almost 7 years after college. Lots of memories. TT is no joke, and he's not 25 anymore either. From the inception of DP, he is the most athletic. My dad rode bulls for a bit, and I admit I don't want to. To do that takes some real guts. You can never say he's not for real; TT grabs life by the horns. Respect. Sparky, no shame brother. Very, very few people in the world can say they've been clipped by a bull. I would've had a stain in my paints. You got off that adrenaline dump and delivered."" When that cowboy just rattled off ""doubt kills dreams faster than failure ever could"", that hit hard. You could tell it was his ethos. I've never been ""nervous"" watching a DP video - but waiting for that shoot to open was legit. Awesome job DP!",0.4715

Personally I think it would be easier for me to take a seat and promptly get bucked off than to do what sparky did. It’s a different game when you’re there, you go into fight or flight mode and you don’t have control of your body like you’d think. I ran with the bulls in Spain and had a goal of touching a bull and wanted to run in front of them for a bit, but when they came storming through I basically blacked out and got TF out of their way",-0.1018

First I want to acknowledge the brotherhood and support that the other guys gave for Tyler throughout. It really shows how much that care for each other.

2nd thing. Sparky, even after wanting to call it quits during practice, you showed up when it mattered most, geared up and was in the ring right there with Tyler.

and finally.. Tyler. The courage and strength needed to get out there and ride those bulls, my hat is off to you man. No matter how much anyone tried pushing you to ride a lower tier bull, you pulled the trigger and went with Stomper. Nothing but respect there brother. I fully expect to see another video of you going the full 8 seconds on Stomper in the near future.",0.689
2,"This was without a doubt, Dude Perfect’s most authentic video yet. It’s risky doing a video showcasing real individuals whose livelihood has very dire consequences, in a way that doesn’t make a mockery of them. More often than not, they’re more cringeworthy than entertainment. This brief video depicted cowboys and rodeos as not just another sport, but rather a way of life. It captured a bit of the essence of what it means to be a cowboy. Well done boys.",0.3486

0,Not a fan of this sport. An old sport that i think wouldn't be missed if it went away. reason is how inhumane those bulls are treated. the things they do to those bulls to make them preform is absolutely positively horrible. I can understand why people would enjoy the sport and why it's interesting to some people. but i think a lot of people don't know how badly those animals are treated and if they knew they wouldn't support the sport. Or they do know and they don't care because it's an animal.,-0.0329

This reminded me of a rodeo related experience I had. It was 2013 and I was on a cross country road trip. Decided to stop in Duncan Oklahoma to see a rodeo. In between events they invited people from the stands to come out for a “game”. I wanted to, but didn’t because I was in flip flops. The “game” was letting a legit bull into the ring with a ribbon tied around its horn. The person to pull the ribbon off got something dumb (I don’t remember what, maybe a funnel cake or $20?)…

There would be so many great stereotypes for this video like “The Bully”, “The School Mascot”, “The Pranksters”, “The School Supply Freak”, “The Nice Teacher” vs “The STRICT Teacher”, which would have to be Sparky, “Back to School Shopping”, “Lunch Break”, “End of Year Party”, and the “Rage Monster” can be one of the most classic school stereotypes of all time: Ty getting an F on a test starting like crazy followed by Cody getting an A+ after not studying at all and then showing off in front of Ty, or Ty getting sent to Principal Cody’s office.

In conclusion , this would be a great video for you guys to make, so if anybody agrees, please like this comment as much as possible so Dude Perfect season starts to think they need to make School Stereotypes too.

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but. i simply only counted alex on this video as it didnt seem like any of the other games were fitting for a win given the massive teams and the lack of dp play. the final game was fine to me so i gave it to the last man standing. Alex.

ty - 36.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 18 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)
alex - 1

0,"At the beginning of the video your battle is extremely unfair since blue team goes first, giving them a massive advantage. I simulated the scenario in sheets, and regardless of both teams accuracy or starting players, if they are equal, the team that goes first wins by a lot. I eventually discovered that the team that goes second will always need to hit 1/(the firsts accuracy-1).  In other words, If Blue goes first... if blue team hits 1 in 5 shots, red must hit 1 in 4 shots to even tie. Even if they both have terrible accuracy, and blue only hits 1 in 1,000,000 shots, red must hit 1 in 999,999 shots to tie.
If you ever want to do this again, you should make it fair. Make the rounds such that whichever team shoots second maintains all their players until after they have shot.
So say Red shoots first and hits 12 Blue people, those 12 Blue people stay on, and shoot back to hit the Red people. Then at the end of the round all ""hit"" players are out. This eliminates the shoot first win advantage and makes the game more fair. 
Or just make it an actual 100 vs. 100 battle like we though it was, on a battlefield, that would be proper cool.
I've been a fan for a long time, so I'm just happy to provide this feedback, No hate, just want you guys to be fair, and fun.",0.9581

I understand you want to cater to the younger/kids generation but this channel has gotten extremely childish. Idk who manages the videos and what yall produce but you need to act more mature with making your content. No one wants to watch a 40 year old act like Ned Flanders anymore. You can still make Christian content without acting like a four year old.,-0.7847

LeBron James: A Legacy Beyond the Game

Introduction and Early Life

LeBron Raymone James stands among the most iconic athletes of the 21st century, a name synonymous with basketball greatness, cultural influence, and social activism. As one of the most celebrated players in NBA history, James has redefined what it means to be a professional athlete—not only through his dominance on the court but also through his far-reaching impact off of it. Whether it’s leading a team to a championship, building a media empire, or opening a public school for underserved youth, LeBron’s influence transcends sports. His journey from a challenging upbringing in Akron, Ohio, to becoming a global icon is a story of perseverance, talent, and calculated vision.

Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, LeBron James was raised by his single mother, Gloria James, who gave birth to him at the age of 16. Life was difficult for the young James, as Gloria struggled to find steady employment and housing. The two often moved from apartment to apartment, living in some of Akron’s most economically challenged neighborhoods. LeBron’s early life was marked by instability and adversity, a stark contrast to the stability and success he would eventually create for himself and his family. Despite these challenges, Gloria did everything she could to provide for her son and shield him from the dangers of their environment. She recognized early on that her son had immense athletic potential and did her best to place him in situations where he could thrive.

LeBron’s life began to change dramatically in fourth grade when he started playing organized basketball. His natural ability was immediately apparent—he was fast, strong, and had a natural feel for the game. As he began playing on youth teams, coaches and parents alike took notice of his talent. One such influential figure was Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced LeBron to basketball and later became a stabilizing figure in his life. Recognizing the importance of structure, Walker and others in LeBron’s life provided the guidance and mentorship he needed to stay on a positive path.

By the time LeBron reached high school, he was already being heralded as a future NBA star. He attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school in Akron with a strong basketball program. From his freshman year, LeBron dominated high school basketball in a way that few had ever seen before. His team went undefeated in his first season, winning the state championship, and LeBron quickly became a national sensation. His high school games began to draw thousands of spectators, including celebrities and scouts from every major college and NBA team. He was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a junior—a rare feat for a high school athlete—with the headline “The Chosen One,” a title that would follow him throughout his career.

As his fame grew, so did the scrutiny. LeBron faced intense media attention and pressure to perform even before graduating high school. Every game he played was televised, analyzed, and critiqued. He became a symbol of promise and potential, and many wondered whether he could live up to the almost mythic expectations being placed upon him. Despite this, LeBron remained focused and grounded. He continued to lead his team to victories, winning three state championships in four years and finishing his high school career with an astonishing 101–6 record.

By 2003, LeBron James had become the most highly touted high school basketball player in history. Instead of attending college, he declared for the NBA draft directly out of high school—a decision that came with significant risk and reward. The Cleveland Cavaliers, holding the first overall pick in the draft, selected LeBron, making him the hometown hero for a franchise in desperate need of revival. From the moment he entered the league, the weight of expectation on his shoulders was immense. He wasn’t just a rookie; he was a savior, a brand, and a symbol of hope.

What separated LeBron even then, aside from his talent, was his maturity and understanding of the moment. He signed endorsement deals with Nike, Coca-Cola, and other major brands before playing a single professional game. At just 18 years old, LeBron became a millionaire and a business entity. Despite the distractions that come with fame and wealth, he never wavered in his commitment to excellence on the court.

LeBron’s early life and high school career laid the foundation for what would become one of the most legendary careers in sports history. His story is not just one of natural talent but also of resilience, discipline, and vision. From the streets of Akron to the national spotlight, he demonstrated the ability to handle pressure with poise and consistently deliver on expectations. His early years were a prelude to the greatness that would follow—both on the court and far beyond it.

⸻

NBA Career Highlights – Cleveland, Miami, and Los Angeles

When LeBron James entered the NBA in 2003 as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers, he was not only the most anticipated rookie in decades but also a hometown savior for a franchise long mired in mediocrity. From the very beginning, LeBron showcased a rare combination of size, skill, basketball IQ, and poise. Standing 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighing around 250 pounds, with the agility of a guard and the power of a forward, he quickly proved that the hype was justified.

LeBron’s rookie season was nothing short of remarkable. He averaged 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, earning the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Though the Cavaliers did not make the playoffs, LeBron’s arrival had transformed the team into a must-watch franchise. Over the next few years, he continued to elevate his play, developing into one of the league’s most versatile and dominant forces. By the 2005–06 season, he had led Cleveland to the playoffs, and in 2007, he carried an underdog Cavaliers team to the NBA Finals. Though they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron’s leadership and performance signaled the arrival of a generational superstar.

Despite his brilliance, the Cavaliers struggled to build a championship-caliber roster around him. Year after year, LeBron put up MVP-caliber numbers and led the team deep into the playoffs, but Cleveland’s lack of a true supporting cast limited their ceiling. After seven seasons without a title, LeBron made the most controversial decision of his career: in July 2010, he announced on national television that he would be “taking his talents to South Beach” and joining the Miami Heat.

However, from a basketball standpoint, the move made sense. In Miami, LeBron joined forces with fellow superstars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form a “Big Three” that would dominate the NBA. LeBron evolved as a player during his time in Miami, refining his post game, improving his efficiency, and taking on a greater defensive role. He won two MVP awards in 2012 and 2013, and led the Heat to four straight NBA Finals appearances from 2011 to 2014.

The pinnacle of LeBron’s career came in 2016, when the Cavaliers staged one of the greatest comebacks in NBA history. Down 3–1 in the Finals to a 73-win Warriors team, the Cavaliers stormed back to win the series in seven games. LeBron delivered iconic performances, including a triple-double in Game 7 and the legendary chase-down block on Andre Iguodala.

After fulfilling his promise to Cleveland, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. His first season was injury-plagued, but the 2019–20 campaign—paired with Anthony Davis—ended with a championship in the NBA bubble. At age 35, he secured his fourth NBA title and became the first player to win Finals MVP with three different franchises.

Through each phase—Cleveland, Miami, Cleveland again, and Los Angeles—LeBron has demonstrated an uncanny ability to lead, adapt, and dominate across different eras and systems, reinforcing his unique status as a transcendent athlete.

⸻

Championships, Accolades, and Career Achievements

LeBron James’ accolades span every conceivable category. He is a four-time NBA champion (2012, 2013, 2016, 2020), four-time league MVP (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013), and a four-time NBA Finals MVP. His performances in the postseason are legendary, from his 45-point elimination game against Boston in 2012 to his 2016 Finals masterpiece.

In 2023, he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer—a crowning achievement that encapsulated both his skill and longevity. LeBron has been named to the All-NBA First Team more than a dozen times, and he has been an NBA All-Star every year since 2005.

Beyond the numbers, LeBron has consistently led his teams in scoring, rebounding, and assists. He is the only player in league history to amass over 40,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a statistical trifecta that underscores his all-around dominance.

LeBron’s greatness is not just in accumulation but in impact: his presence on the floor changes the geometry of the game, forcing defenses to adjust, coaches to strategize differently, and teammates to elevate their play.

Off-the-Court Ventures – Business, Activism, and Philanthropy

LeBron’s off-court legacy is as formidable as his basketball career. As a businessman, he’s built a billion-dollar empire through smart investments, brand partnerships, and ownership stakes—including Nike",0.9997

0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 22 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 37.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 22 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 19 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious",0.9978

8,"I been putting this same comment in all of your videos for a while now. We haven’t gotten a stereotype video in months. You guys have came up with so many unique themes, but YOU NEED TO MAKE “School Stereotypes”. There could be so many things like “School Supply Freak” who has every pen or marker imaginable, The School Mascot” who is being followed by every kid in the school, and the “Rage Monster” can be one of the most biggest school classics. Ty getting an F on a test and Cody showing off because he got an A. They can make “easy teacher”, and “strict teacher”, and that strict teacher WOULD HAVE TO BE Sparky. If anybody agrees, please like this comment so Dude Perfect thinks they should make School Stereotypes too. 💯 👍

0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 37.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 19 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)

mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

Playable Character that I choose:
• Orochi 🐍🥷⛩️

Gender:
• ♂️/♀️

Hero Type(s):
• Assassin

Faction(s):
• Samurai 

Difficulty: 
• Hard | Assassin Fighting Style | Counter-Attacker

Sub-Faction(s):

• Dude Perfect - an American sports and comedy group and YouTube channel headquartered in Frisco, Texas. The group consists of Tyler ""The Beard"" Toney, ""The Twins"" Cory and Coby Cotton, Garrett ""The Purple Hoser"" Hilbert, and Cody ""The Tall Guy"" Jones, all of whom are former college roommates at Texas A&M University. Four members of the group, Jones being an exception, were brothers of the Gamma chapter of the Beta Upsilon Chi fraternity at A&M.

• Chapter 1 - The Tall Guy: Cody Jones, a.k.a. “Tall Guy” for a reason. Measuring in at six-and-a-half feet, you may not always hear Cody coming, but you’ll definitely see him. As the resident goofball of the dudes, he loves to keep things loud, joke around, and make sure everyone’s laughing. These traits come in handy when you consider the fact that he is—wait for it—scared of heights.

• Cody Jones is the Warden ♂️/♀️ | Adaptable Fighting Style | Straight-Forward Strategy

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Easy 
• Hero Type: Vanguard 
• Faction: Knights 

• Chapter 2 - The Bearded Guy: Whether he’s hosting Overtime, donning an alter-ego, or destroying sets as The Rage Monster, Tyler Toney is the face of the dudes, he comes alive in front of an audience and has a knack for turning anything into a competition. That might explain why he holds the record for the most solo battle wins at Dude Perfect.

• Tyler Toney is the Berserker ♂️/♀️ | Harasser Fighting Style | Short-Ranged Attack 

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Hard  
• Hero Type: Assassin  
• Factions: Vikings 

• Chapter 3 - The Twins: Coby Cotton is still waiting on his breakout year, Coby has spent the past 12 dude perfect seasons grinding out a grand total of exactly 4 battle wins. Yet somehow, he is convinced the best is still ahead of him. One minute older than Cory Cotton, you’ll most likely find him with a smile on his face, sipping on a cold glass of chocolate milk. Cory, his tough luck twin, is the Michael Jordan of Unfortune. He’s the all-time leader in wheel spins, and if a Get Crafty is in play, for your own safety...stay away. He loves playing basketball, is a milkshake connoisseur, a sneakerhead, and a slowly improving golfer. More than anything, though, he loves to ride those little rental scooters that are all over the place in big cities.

• Coby and Cory Cotton are the Shinobi ♂️/♀️ | Mobile Skirmisher | Counter-Attacker 

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Hard  
• Hero Type: Assassin  
• Faction: Samurai 

• Chapter 4 - The Purple Hoser: As the “dad” of the dudes, Garrett Hilbert spends much of his time cleaning around the office, balancing the budget, and keeping the group organized. Generally, he’s the most responsible of the bunch, but even the Purple Hoser has his moments—especially when it comes to springing for cool new office toys.

• Garrett Hilbert is the Black Prior ♂️/♀️ | Defense Specialist | Strong Support Abilities 

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Medium 
• Hero Type: Heavies 
• Factions: Knights  

• In the condition of Quest Completed: The Dude Perfect is not your enemy anymore. You've offered them peace and separate ways. And do whatever they want.

0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 36.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 18 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious",0.9978

0,I might run the numbers later.  I’m sure it would be easy to write an equation where you could plug in the baseball speed and it would tell you how fast it gets to home plate.  It should be a linear equation.  But at 200 MPH I’m guessing you’d have to start swinging no later than when the ball is fired because it would get there fast.  At 1000 MPH you’d have to start swinging before the ball is fired but if it hit you you’d almost surely die.  It would be like a bullet BUT its Mass would be so much bigger.,-0.8826

1,"A little bit of constructive criticism for the DP producers: This video, along with some recent ones, feel like they’re really veering away from what dp is all about. This whole video just felt like an ad for the video game. It had no uniformity or organization. It was sort of just random things pieced together. Was it a battle? A bucket list? 

It also feels way too similar to the one you guys did with the rangers last year. And then theres videos like the recent carvana one that felt like one big long ad. It had no pacing and it was not entertaining. It also felt like a much lamer version of the trick shot championship video. Watching random millennials compete in basic games isn’t what we’re subscribed for. We want to see the five dudes we grew up with in classic series like battles and overtime. Nobody wants to watch “Chad and Jackson” go on a half hearted amazing race that has two steps and is so obviously a carvana ad. Heck, your audience is primarily 8 year olds. Who’s using carvana? And other parts like the basketball game that felt endless and the spelling bee were also uninspiring. Most people wouldn’t find a spelling be interesting even if they knew the participants. Let alone random people we’ve never heard of. 

Overall, less ads, less strange, unorganized one off videos, and more of the classics we’ve grown to love.",0.9215

They had to pull a vacuum in the barrel which we can see you arent doing.

Chris Smith, US-Repräsentant und Vorsitzender des CECC, eröffnete die Anhörung, indem er ihre Bedeutung hervorhob: „Dies ist eine wichtige Anhörung, in der es um eine der hartnäckigsten und schrecklichsten Menschenrechtsverletzungen unserer Zeit geht, die jedoch leider nicht die Aufmerksamkeit und Verurteilung erfahren hat, die sie verdient.“ Er hat bereits zwei Anhörungen im US-Kongress abgehalten und erklärt, Organraub sei unvorstellbar und inakzeptabel.



Der US-Repräsentant und CECC-Vorsitzende Chris Smith moderierte die Anhörung am 20. März 2024.

Unter Berufung auf frühere Feststellungen des China-Tribunals von Sir Geoffry Nice aus dem Jahr 2019 sagte Smith, das Tribunal sei „einstimmig und zuversichtlich und ohne jeden vernünftigen Zweifel zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass in China die Zwangsentnahme von Organen an Gefangenen aus Gewissensgründen schon seit geraumer Zeit praktiziert wird und eine beträchtliche Zahl von Opfern betrifft“. Genauer gesagt waren die Hauptopfer Falun-Dafa-Praktizierende und Uiguren.

„Chinas Organraub im industriellen Maßstab ist eine Gräueltat von beispielloser Perversität“, erklärte Smith und fügte hinzu: „Die Zahl der Menschen, die wegen ihrer Organe hingerichtet werden, manche sogar bevor sie hirntot sind, ist erschütternd.“ Aus diesem Grund hat das chinesische Tribunal den staatlich geförderten Organraub in China als „Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit“ eingestuft.

Vor etwa einem Jahr verabschiedete das Repräsentantenhaus mit überwältigender Mehrheit von 413 zu 2 Stimmen den „Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act“, und Smith forderte den Senat auf, das Gesetz „bis zum Ende durchzuziehen“. Dieses bahnbrechende, parteiübergreifende Gesetz ermächtigt den Außenminister, jedem, der in den illegalen Organhandel in China und weltweit verwickelt ist, Pässe und Visa zu verweigern. Darüber hinaus verlangt das Gesetz vom Außenministerium jährliche Berichte über die Zwangsentnahme von Organen weltweit und sieht Sanktionen gegen Personen und Organisationen vor, die den Organhandel begünstigen.

„Schweigen ist inakzeptabel, insbesondere von medizinischen Verbänden und Unternehmen. Wenn sie schweigen, riskieren sie die Mittäterschaft bei einem Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit“, schloss Smith und fügte hinzu: „Wenn wir jetzt nicht handeln, werden noch viel mehr Menschenleben verloren gehen.“",-0.997

0,"Audience Supports Falun Gong
Daniel Goodwin, who works in the legal field, heard about Falun Gong in 2018. After watching the documentary, he said that more people should be made aware of the CCP’s crime of live organ harvesting. “Many people don’t know about this yet,” he said, “but they should know about this atrocity. I started to learn about it in 2018.”


Daniel Goodwin condemned the persecution of Falun Gong.

“The CCP doesn’t just persecute Falun Gong,” he said. “Now the CCP is also persecuting people from other groups. But the CCP mostly persecutes Falun Gong practitioners.”

As a Christian, he expressed his support for Falun Gong practitioners’ freedom of belief.

Dr. Li, a cardiologist, watched the documentary with her husband. She said, “I knew the CCP persecuted Falun Gong, but I didn’t know the persecution was so severe, with one hundred million people being persecuted. I didn’t know the CCP specifically persecuted Falun Gong before. China has such a big problem, and the CCP is wrong to do this.”

Patty Willett, retired from a Silicon Valley computer company, wept while she watched the documentary. “It was the first time I heard about Falun Gong,” she said. “Seeing them being persecuted made me feel very sad and tears came to my eyes. I could feel what their parents had to endure. I couldn’t bear to watch some parts.”


Patty Willett, a retired Silicon Valley employee

Ms. Willett said Falun Gong was completely new to her. “I like the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. This touches me. They have spiritual beliefs. What happened to them [organ harvesting] is unacceptable to me.

“Especially because they are so kind,” she said, “it’s unacceptable to cut up their bodies while they are still alive. The parents are looking for their children, but they can’t find them. It’s heartbreaking.”

Denys, a software engineer from Ukraine, said, “We never heard of Falun Gong before. Today, we not only learned about Falun Gong, but also about the CCP’s crimes against humanity.”


Hannah (left) and Denys (right) from Ukraine

Hannah, also from Ukraine, said, “The CCP is evil, and communism is evil. Just like the Soviet Union, communism is evil everywhere. I hope this film can play a role. Exposure will help. Exposing the evil of communism will cause the CCP to disintegrate.”

This wasn’t the first time Erica Hathaway, a pet sitter, had heard about the CCP’s persecution of Falun Gong and its crime of forced organ harvesting. After watching the documentary, she gained a deeper understanding of the extent of the CCP’s crimes. “I knew that the CCP was harvesting organs from living people, but I didn’t know it was on such a large scale, with so many people being detained and their organs harvested for profit.”


Erica Hathaway admires Falun Gong. 

Ms. Hathaway admires Falun Gong practitioners’ firm belief. “They are persecuted to death for their belief, which shows that they are very firm in their belief. I pray for them and hope that the persecution will end soon.”

She said that the documentary is excellent. “It is credible. All the information is credible, and it’s well-made. It’s portrayed in such a direct way that makes people feel that something must be done about it.”",-0.9929

2,"Seeing that there's a desire to do this annually... my suggestion... some sort of group stage where they get points across multiple tricks. Hate seeing someone go home on the first trick even though I'm not familiar with them. Especially in an industry that is just as much about determination and never giving up as it is about skill.
*EXAMPLE:*
*- 2 Groups of 4 =* All teams compete in a set of 3 or 4 tricks. Teams get points based on their finishing order in their group for each trick (5, 3, 2, 1). 
*- Finals =* The winners of each group qualify directly to the finals. The two 2nd place teams compete head-to-head in the next trick, Winner of that goes into the 3-team final with the group winners.

This would allow teams to potentially benefit from their specialities, while not being doomed if the first trickshot is something they've never done before.",0.9364

As a Believer, it lights a fire in my soul (in a bad way) to watch already-wealthy Believers (NOTHING wrong with being a wealthy Believer!) not only flaunt their purchasing power in front of those that help give them that power but they add insult to injury when they ask (require???) their staff to compete for them so that they can flaunt that purchasing power in front of their staff. Disgusting. 

DP, you should have left it at one of your staffers wins a Lambo but not gone as far as one of you winning a Lambo off the skin of their backs - or just skipped that awful episode altogether. 

Also, did your staffers volunteer to be a part of this episode or were they required &/or coerced/cornered to be a part of it? Just asking because as a fellow Believer I certainly would preach some bold Pauline-esque Words to the DP crew if I were presented with an ""opportunity"" to compete for one of you to win a Lambo. Can't you eat at home?! Why do you gorge yourselves in front of those less fortunate when you gather? Ya know, that's just off the top of my head...go look the verse up if you need an exact quote.

0,"Here's an idea. I'll try and keep it short bowling. Y'all do 10th frame, roll off best one wins. It's pretty short video.
Golf one hole shootout elimination too closes to the hole
Plays three golf holes, low score wins of course
Tennis hard to explain but I'll try and keep it. It's simple.
Names in hat pic opponents best out of 3 points.
Top 2 play a full round against each other.
Baseball home run Derby 3 hits each total yards winds, top 2.
Then the top 2 do a 20 hit or 10 hit home run. Derby, most home runs win.
Basketball, the 3 point shootout, where they have the balls lined up. Besscore wins.
Soccer hit the goal from 4 points of the field top 2 does a kick off against each other? Where they score a goal and the other has to score.
Hockey, same thing as Soccer.
Football do a throwing thing like the pro bowl does where they compete, who gets the most points.
Frisbee, same as football.
Badminton, same as Tennis.
Go carts  you already did
Some of these I know you already did, but I'm talking about, like you would see a profession will do it. I'd like the 10th frame roll off that happens during competition.
If that sounds boring, you can add stuff to make it funner.
Or hmm, the crazy stuff y'all do like, instead of a bowling ball, it's a baseball or other stuff y'all come up with.",0.9936

0,"Hudson Institute Director Shea: I Don’t Believe the CCP Regime

Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank, speaks at a press conference on September 4, 2024.

Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said during the press conference, “I salute Mr. Cheng for his courage. He is the only survivor [of live organ harvesting] to publicly stand up against this horrific atrocity, and we need to hear his voice.”

Shea said that when she met Mr. Cheng last week, she saw the scars left by the operation on his body up close, checked the scans, and read the doctor’s and expert reports. Shea said, “I believe him, I believe he is a survivor of the CCP’s live organ harvesting. I don’t believe the Chinese government, I don’t believe the CCP, because the CCP has always lied, confused the public, spread false information, and covered up the facts.”

Shea said that [live organ harvesting] is still happening, and she doesn’t believe it will stop unless there is an international independent investigation team to investigate.


Former Congressman Frank Wolf addressed the press conference.

Frank Wolf, who served as a U.S. congressman for 34 years, expressed anger at some mainstream media in the United States for avoiding the issue of organ harvesting from living people in China. He asked at the press conference, “Where is The Washington Post?”

He thanked Mr. Cheng and said, “It takes great courage. If a person has experienced all this, they would want to forget it completely.”

Wolf said that the CCP’s organ harvesting from living people has been known for many years, and people have learned about it at rallies and other events, and it’s already known to everyone. He said, “Our government has failed the Chinese people on this issue.”

Like Congressman Wolf, Hudson Institute Director Shea is concerned about this. “Our outstanding medical schools and universities have become accomplices, providing research and training programs to China.” The records of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) show that American universities have trained 344 (Chinese) transplant doctors.

Shea said that the medical schools heard about this crime against humanity, but they have not even raised questions, nor have they asked China where the organs came from, or asked them to confirm the source of the organs.

Wolf proposed to bring legal action against doctors, institutions, hospitals, training centers, etc. in the United States and other Western countries that participated in the CCP’s organ harvesting to stop this behavior.",0.7151

Fans watch this channel because it’s unique, so please don’t just try to be like everyone else! I found it confusing and hard to follow. A lot going on at once, and pacing was all over the place. Some parts took a minute, and then something like the 1v4 basketball felt like it was half the video.

And the biggest issue is just the video itself. I personally only really watch to see the five dudes we grew up with. I don’t really care about watching employees I’ve never heard of. And the overtime, trick shots, battles and stereotypes are just better.

Plus the constant carmax advertising was annoying. And pointless considering the fact that I’d imagine about 95% of your viewers are 12 or younger.
