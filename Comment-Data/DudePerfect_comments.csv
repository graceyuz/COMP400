I wouldn't have liked it so much if he had just lasted those 8 seconds, the video is not about bull riding, it's about life, someone has a Cupcake and everything is easier, and someone has a Stomper, the main thing is to stand up and say ""I'll try again"""

0,Seeing this side of the team is amazing! I’ve been watching Dude Perfectly for easily 15 years almost since they started. Tyler I related to the most! I remember downloading videos onto a flash drive and watching them on the weekends when I was out of school at home. Amazing job Tyler and I have no doubt in my mind if you even had a couple months of training you would’ve killed it even more than u already did

1,"As a former pro bull rider let me tell you....that took serious try. And for everyone impressed by Ty, that whole video stood out for Sparky. That was NOT an easy ask to get out an oull turns with  FOR REAL bulls. That practice pen was the real deal. And to have him pulling 6's after a little hookin, man TONS of guys would run away.....he had a few mins and some real punchers telling  him how to deal with it and he did.....a little surprised how they let Ty wrap on just his 3rd real bull. But he stepped up. But they should put a barrel at their compound and he should start entering steady in the off time. He's close!!!!"

air rack"
76,"Native Texan here, lived in Fort Worth for almost 7 years after college. Lots of memories. TT is no joke, and he's not 25 anymore either. From the inception of DP, he is the most athletic. My dad rode bulls for a bit, and I admit I don't want to. To do that takes some real guts. You can never say he's not for real; TT grabs life by the horns. Respect. Sparky, no shame brother. Very, very few people in the world can say they've been clipped by a bull. I would've had a stain in my paints. You got off that adrenaline dump and delivered."" When that cowboy just rattled off ""doubt kills dreams faster than failure ever could"", that hit hard. You could tell it was his ethos. I've never been ""nervous"" watching a DP video - but waiting for that shoot to open was legit. Awesome job DP!"
0,"I have now watched TT do almost everything, and he just figures it out. Mad respect Tyler... MAD RESPECT!!!"
0,Did anyone spot ariack as a old man

0,When I was a kid a 120 pound 11 year old kid who rode a 200 pound young bull. In a rodeo in Rosarito Mexico. I will say I understand the fear 1000 percent. I'm from California. And definitely always feel like I could have done better and have gone pro. (P.s. I won the comp.) Still feel bad for that young bull because he definitely didn't make it to full age. Still 1for 1 batting 1000 hahahahaha
0,Is that ariak
0,Tyler...we're the same age. But i'm sitting here Sunday Morning eating breakfast with my daughter and Drinking Coffee as I am thinking about how bad my knees hurt from cutting down a few trees on the farm yesterday.  You are America's Athlete Dude.
1,"Kudos to the whole team for this video.  I appreciated and felt the fear of Sparky, which was real life, and his willingness to share it with the audience.  To even get in the ring at the rodeo took real guts.   I also appreciated Tyler's determination and his physical ability to even try this.  I keep thinking DP videos can't get any better, but they do.  Thanks..."
3,Mad respect for Ty and Sparky… real guts on display from both and a huge win all things considered!
0,I love you Ty
0,"Love how they promote jesus our lord, amen 🙏. Love this vid"
2,Huge respect for Sparky the level of bravery he showed. But of course the utmost respect for Tyler
1,"When you're trying to either ride or run from a bull, faith is the only thing you can rely on!"

1,thats was insane man wow ty wow
1,love that you guys were bold about your faith
0,This right here has to be my favorite video it has Cody Johnson and cowboys🤠🤠
2,"I was screaming the way through ""thats my dude"" for TT and sparky 
I've said it for years this is the best channel on YouTube great guys all thw way through and they never stop striving to do better"
0,Is that @airrack in the background before his ride on the show the one with the moustache???
0,"Im surprised this wasn't done sooner by DP, if I'm being honest"
0,Dude Perfect is better than any TV. Always one-upping themselves and pushing themselves to the limit as humans; all while giving props to the man upstairs. S-Tier content. Love you crazy dudes!
0,First failed video of DP 😂

0,that was scary all the way through But If I had a hat on right on I would pull it off to you Tyler that was an awesome display of grit and tenacity hopefully that didn't hurt for a long time and aprky too I hope that tailbone hit didn't hurt for too long
0,"27:12 @airrack screming ""lets go""!!"
0,this is a pretty intense video but i love that they included Christ
1,"I was torn on this video: Absolutely fabulous production and props to the guys, this sport is fascinating, but at the same time I feel with these poor bulls and the fear and torment they go through every day."
0,If she tells you 8 seconds isn’t too much show her this video
0,arrack???
2,"Let's go Sparky!!
Proud of you TT👏"
2,Much respect....to Ty and to Sparky!
1,"I love your videos and it is exciting, to see you in this kind of sport, but from the animals point of view it's the worst.
Most of the people would say ""it's just a cow"", or ""bull riding isn't hurting them"", but the reality is, that they tie a rope around the cows' testicles and squeeze them. This causes terrible pain, which cause them to buck. 

I know it's fun to watch it, but on the other side you watch animals getting hurt. Think about it..."
0,This was the most USA thing I've seen on this channel. All that was missing was time units like freedom per oil or something like that xD
0,It has been a hot minute since I been this emotionally invested in a YouTube video. And of course it’s the Dudes

0,tyler tony greatest athlete the grace the universe
1,call peta
24,This is one of those DP videos where the whole team stepped up. Tyler doing something incredible but the A/V and editing team capturing and making it just that much more special in the way they presented it. Kudus to everyone involved. Also big up’s to sparky for overcoming that fear and being vulnerable on camera for the world to see.
0,Tyler Tony the GREATEST athlete of all time.
0,Airrack in the back 23:13

11,Calling Tyler an average dude is a crime
30,"Man the love in this friend group is something MOST people just sadly NEVER find, I'm so happy for all of them"
1,By far the most authentic video I've ever seen from this channel. I was genuinely surprised. I definitely prefer this kind of video to (for example) the soapbox cars one.

0,Love this one great work Dudes

1,Tyler proves once again that he is on a whole another level. So brave. Sparky too. Great one guys. Wow.
0,"Great video, you guys are true role models!"
1,Man I’m so proud of the both of you.
0,I really appreciate the out in the open prayer and Christianity. Only took you 12 years but better late than never I suppose.
0,Airrack I saw you
0,"Hey, everyone whoever sees this comment, I don't request you to like my comment. Go and like the video instead because dude perfect deserves it. They have been entertaining us for 16 years and they don't even have 100 million subs. Where people like The Stokes Twins have 100+ million subs. So I just request you to at least subscribe for their true efforts in every video."
2,"One of my all-time favorite Dude Perfect videos! It was super exciting, pushed the limits, and showed your faith in such a real way. I didn’t want it to end! More content like this, please! I’m so here for it! Also, major props to Tyler and Sparky. Those are some studs."
5,"Absolutely loved this video! The faith, the devotion, and raw emotion, by far on of your best videos to date. Absolutely loved how you are completely unafraid yo show your faith in front of a camera and then demonstrate it by getting on that beast. Mad props to both of you!!"
0,I miss OT videos ngl
0,"Man I’ve been watching you guys since 2012, this is easily my favorite video ever!"
1,I have been watching you guys from the very beginning. This is by far the best video that I have seen you guys do. I have far more respect for Tyler. That is not easy. And then to get stomped on the chest and get back up shows a lot about him. His boys saw it as well. That’s special. They’ll never forget that
3,Don’t ever doubt yourself sparky! You’re great. Ty you’re next level!
0,"I’m not a big fan of this Clickbait, Calling Tyler Tony a ‘average dude’ nothing about Tyler is average. He is one of the greatest athletes of all time, I’m not surprised he smashed this out of the park"
0,My respect cowboy up Tyler
1,I’ve been watching dude perfect since I was in 5th grade I’m 21 now and ride bucking horses this video was something I never even thought possible but I’m sure glad it happened. Well done boys

0,Can we have more bull riding videos‼️‼️ might be my favorite video this year!
2,"Ty!! You are a legitimate role model to so many. I absolutely love the dedication and passion you put into what you're doing. Also I gave the like for sparky bucking up and making that save in his practice after getting gored. Overall this is, in my opinion, one of the most inspiring and empowering videos you've done and I love to see it. Coming from a place where Rodeo is huge I have all the respect possible for both you Tyler and Sparky!! Keep doing what you do"
1,"New respect for sparky, he was always a little lame for me… but he is a dude for me from now on 👏🏻👏🏻"
0,"Tyler is anything but average, this dude took hits from bulls and legit wouldn’t quit but this is Tyler tony, I’m glad he’s still alive and walking"
0,Is that airrack in the back!?

0,Is that airrack
474,"This is the first ""real"" thing you've posted here.  It cannot be repeated indefinitely, you have no control over anything other than yourself, and following through requires true grit.  And I knew Sparky would lose his fear the moment you hit the ground and willingly take a hit for you.  Great job, Spark!"
0,That first bull was VERY aware how long its supposed to go for 😂
0,Thank you for doing this DP it’s truly inspiring 🥰
0,airrack casually at 23:13 in the red flannel
0,I like to see Darren Watkins Jr. to face the bull to see who's really called *SPEED*
0,This was the most interesting video yet to me
0,Arrick we see you lil bro
2,"Which is more scary riding the bull or running at it? 

Personally I think it would be easier for me to take a seat and promptly get bucked off than to do what sparky did. It’s a different game when you’re there, you go into fight or flight mode and you don’t have control of your body like you’d think. I ran with the bulls in Spain and had a goal of touching a bull and wanted to run in front of them for a bit, but when they came storming through I basically blacked out and got TF out of their way"
0,This guy is better than Donald Cerrone😂
0,Air rack not slick
0,I used to ride mini bulls back when i was 15. Got stepped on and completely smashed my hand. That was it for me. Kansas tough
0,"Anyone else just vicarously living their life through Tyler in this video?

0,"We’ve been sharing DP with our kids for a LONG time, 11 years at least. Stereotypes, battles, Bucket Lists… honestly, we felt there was a drift over the last year, a vision shift from the DP mission. Both my wife and I got emotional watching this video and were so thankful to see the focus return to the roots. Personally for me, it was deeply inspiring and motivational with the journey Sparky took and to end the video on a different note was refreshing. THANK YOU for all that you guys do and we will continue to follow this journey."
0,I was gonna skip this one bc bull riding rodeo isnt my cup of tea but this turned into maybe my favorite episode you guys have done. thanks for being bold in your faith in this vid and congrats!!!

0,Airrack what are you doing 💀💀 23:11
0,Would you go 2.7 seconds on a bull?!?
0,Why no neck guards on the helmets?😬
1,"Big respect to Ty and Sparky. The bull wranglers don't get the credit they deserve. They can get hurt or killed just as bad as the rider. Great job, fellas!"
0,23:11 Airrack thinks he’s slick! Hello YouTube!
0,Bro is that airrack back there
0,Come to the Dallas hunting show this week and come to the wade lemon hunting booth
0,"I was not impressed by Sparky's training performance, but once it was Ty on the ground Sparky stepped up. I was real impressed by that. Courage is stepping forward to face down a bull even though you're scared, and he did. I don't know that Sparky would have stopped the bull, but I know the bull would have to go through Sparky to get to Ty. Respect."
1,23:06 Airrack in the back there?
0,My favorite artist and favorite group of guys in one video?!?
0,"a couple years ago Airrack sent Tyler blanchard to ride a bull, and now sending tyler toney thats wild!"

0,Who is that dude? It looks like Eric😅
0,"My worlds are colliding.. he kinda cooked on roping on that horse for his first ever time, and cooked on all those bulls"
0,Tyler doesn't ride Bulls. Bulls ride Tyler! 🐂
0,The best video yet
1,"""average"" 💔"
0,The fact the first bull Tyler rode just stopped when it heard the whistle
2,THIS IS THE BEST DUDE PERFECT VIDEO EVER!!!!

1,"Yea, like Tyler is an ""average Dude""!🙄"
1,When can I get to see Overtime 50?
0,"bull riding is inhumane due to animal welfare concerns. Critics point to the use of flank straps and spurs to encourage bucking, causing pain and distress to the bulls"
0,Great video guys! Ty is insane!
0,Wonder why they call him stomper
0,What an absolute freak athlete Ty is
1,"This is my new favorite Dude Perfect video.

First I want to acknowledge the brotherhood and support that the other guys gave for Tyler throughout. It really shows how much that care for each other.

2nd thing. Sparky, even after wanting to call it quits during practice, you showed up when it mattered most, geared up and was in the ring right there with Tyler.

and finally.. Tyler. The courage and strength needed to get out there and ride those bulls, my hat is off to you man. No matter how much anyone tried pushing you to ride a lower tier bull, you pulled the trigger and went with Stomper. Nothing but respect there brother. I fully expect to see another video of you going the full 8 seconds on Stomper in the near future."
2,"This was without a doubt, Dude Perfect’s most authentic video yet. It’s risky doing a video showcasing real individuals whose livelihood has very dire consequences, in a way that doesn’t make a mockery of them. More often than not, they’re more cringeworthy than entertainment. This brief video depicted cowboys and rodeos as not just another sport, but rather a way of life. It captured a bit of the essence of what it means to be a cowboy. Well done boys."
0,This is the best one you have done!! I’m dying this is hilarious and awesome all at the same time! 👊👊👊
1,spark
0,Not a fan of this sport. An old sport that i think wouldn't be missed if it went away. reason is how inhumane those bulls are treated. the things they do to those bulls to make them preform is absolutely positively horrible. I can understand why people would enjoy the sport and why it's interesting to some people. but i think a lot of people don't know how badly those animals are treated and if they knew they wouldn't support the sport. Or they do know and they don't care because it's an animal.
0,Airrack!!!

And I love to see all the dudes together ❤"
0,I think by now we should all have recognized that Ty is the real deal. Game for anything and has legit talent!
0,Ty and ole son DB look related haha
0,"A bunch of friends that don't dig ditches [or graves] that smile & laugh way too much & entertain so many & don't hurt or alienate anybody. Until some auditor deep dives in order to undermine these blokes... auditors are sad loners that see what they need. Punk rock will prevail. D.E.I. might be calling though. Keep having fun, O.K.?!"
5,"PLEASE let other dudes other than Ty do these quests and do things like be on the thumbnails, it feels so much like just Ty now, it used to be better with every dude equal!!!"

Well, it's bulls and blood

It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles

It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing a rodeo!"

0,TYLER TONEY GREATEST ATHLETE OF ALL TIME
0,The greatest athlete of our time
0,Another Tyler episode of Dude Perfect.
0,100% one of my favorite dp videos and I’ve been with yall from the start. I always felt Tyler would make a great rodeo rider weather it was bulls or stallions
0,"Sorry, I like most of your videos, but I don't get why you have to put animals through sth. like this for 'sport'...."
0,Is that his belt buckle??
0,That’s awesome!
0,I have been to the Fort Worth stock yards and it is the most fun place to be 👍
0,Such a great way to represent this life we call rodeo!!!
0,23:22 @airrack
0,To see how far Dude Perfect has come is amazing I've watching ya'll for over 10 years
0,I have no words. I think there is about to be 61 million people who are in a state of anxious inspiration
0,"Cody Johnson, Dale Brisby and Dude Perfect in one video?!?! 🤩"
2,his kid looked worried and amazed and other things I cannot explain. the way your kid looked at you he will never forget that moment. I wish i could explain those emotions better
0,Hey guys I’m lane and I have been watching y’all’s videos for years and I want to say Y’all should go to the Houston live stock show and rodeo it’s one of the biggest in the world yall will love it.
0,23:10 Airrack is NOT hiding 😂
0,bro airrack im not dumb i see you
1,What are ride. Emotions run wild on this one. Love it.
0,"You guys are insane. Mad Respect.

     Also, something I JUST realized. While Bull riding started in Mexico, it quickly spread to the US and today, very few countries have this. I mean, Imagine somebody saying, ""You see that creature that is 1000 times my weight and hates me. Ya I'm gonna sit on it's back."" normal people runaway from those things."
0,Gotta give spark his credit he really didn’t need to learn to do anything and still showed out.
0,Airrack at 23:12
0,"YO HOW ARE THEY ROPING THE HIND LEGS 
AYOOOOOOOOO?"
3,"Such a cool video. Nice one, for real ! Ty and Sparky, all the respect for both of you!"
0,"Oh, for a second I thought Dale Brisby was I forgot his name"

2,Great video guys I’d love to see more like this! Respect to Sparky for looking out for his buddy.
0,Ty is a psycho
5,"Okay but all props to Sparky for doing that, he did amazing"
0,I genuinely don’t think I’ve ever been so impressed by Ty. I personally have never ridden one of these animals. But I used to run the shoots for rodeo all of the time. Those bulls are mean and tough and it gets scary even just trying to get them into the chute sometimes so I’ve got a lot of respect for Thai because he just didn’t quit. He just showed he is a true bull rider.
0,"Right, animal abuse as entertainment..Time to unsubscribe."
1,"23:10 GOTCHA AIRRACK, hi mafia✌️"
0,Go powder river
0,In every video just type the name airrack
15,26:44 the sparky said NO hit my soul a bit😂😢
0,"Unpopular opinion. Would love to keep the group videos together and while this is great, separate it from the normal. We miss the normal. Or give others the helm and not make it a Tyler video"

3,That’s Awsome!! Tyler that’s cowboy! DALE ya! I want more vids like this
0,BRO How did the first bull just stop at 8 seconds?
1,"Maybe we could have one of these types of videos where Ty does a challenge but with Cody and basketball? (Like how the MLB one where Ty moved up the ranks, just do that with basketball.)"
0,You da man Ty
3,"I love Sparky, I'm at the point he's backing down, but I now he's coming back and is going to conquer this giant."
0,That was absolutely  insane! Mad respect!
1,I’m assuming JB wouldn’t agree to the “no smoking” on camera rule😂🚬
0,Poor gar

1,Who noticed they stopped adding OT (OverTime) to there titles in a year😂
2,"Bit late to the game, but the previous title of this video, ""Average Dude vs. Rodeo Bull"" gets me.
AVERAGE Dude? Please. We're talking about Tyler Toney. It should really be ""Exceptionally Gifted At Literally Everything He Does Dude vs. Rodeo Bull.""
Congrats to Ty and Sparky for a) pulling this video off, b) not dying. I was terrified the whole video, not gonna lie. Love y'all to pieces :)"

4,"17:42 Tyler going straight into doing it again is such a smart and brave move, the more time you stall just the worse you’re going to build it up in you’re head, it might’ve seemed like a pretty big hill at first, could’ve turned into a mountain real quick"
2,23:11 we see you @airrack

This reminded me of a rodeo related experience I had. It was 2013 and I was on a cross country road trip. Decided to stop in Duncan Oklahoma to see a rodeo. In between events they invited people from the stands to come out for a “game”. I wanted to, but didn’t because I was in flip flops. The “game” was letting a legit bull into the ring with a ribbon tied around its horn. The person to pull the ribbon off got something dumb (I don’t remember what, maybe a funnel cake or $20?)…

I remember feeling like I dodged a bullet"

2363,"9:44 I've never seen Sparky demonstrate anything close to this level of concentration. He was making sure he caught everything so he could protect his buddy Ty, gotta love it."
223,"This is the first ""real"" thing youve done on here. it cant be repeated over and over, you dont have control over anything but yourself, and it takes true grit to follow through. And I knew Sparky would lose the fear the second you hit the ground and be willin to take a hit for you. Great Job Spark!"
3465,This may be our new favorite video from DP. The authentic faith and perseverance that you guys feature is a model to young folks that is so rare these days. We are so grateful that you dudes are your authentic selves on your platform and use your renown for true and honorable examples. Brings tears to my wife and I’d eyes to see you all model what we want our kids to live for.

That’s a bad dude right there! Praise The Lord!"

6,"You guys have made so many great stereotype videos throughout your channel’s history. There’s just one stereotype video you guys have needed to make for a long time: School Stereotypes. 

There would be so many great stereotypes for this video like “The Bully”, “The School Mascot”, “The Pranksters”, “The School Supply Freak”, “The Nice Teacher” vs “The STRICT Teacher”, which would have to be Sparky, “Back to School Shopping”, “Lunch Break”, “End of Year Party”, and the “Rage Monster” can be one of the most classic school stereotypes of all time: Ty getting an F on a test starting like crazy followed by Cody getting an A+ after not studying at all and then showing off in front of Ty, or Ty getting sent to Principal Cody’s office.

In conclusion , this would be a great video for you guys to make, so if anybody agrees, please like this comment as much as possible so Dude Perfect season starts to think they need to make School Stereotypes too.

I don't mind some fan videos here and there, but they really should be a minimum. I didn't subscribe to dude perfect to watch other YouTubers or average run of the mill strangers competing and hardly no dude coverage."

6,1:37 top ten things the never happened
0,"First round wasn't fair, blue started first, they had more shots. By the time red shot their first shot they already had less than 50 people and every round blue started first. That's why it wasn't even close, they had 1 more shot in the end and 19 survivors. They should have shot at the same time idk why they decided to go this way"

0,Man I love dude perfects airsoft videos but I wish YouTubers would move away from balloons. As a Airsofter I can tell you that playing a round where one hit to anywhere on your body eliminates you is so much fun. Plus it sucks to see someone behind cover only to lose because of their balloon sticks a foot above their head. Or to watch someone lose because someone’s balloon wouldn’t pop
0,"Wait, what? How can you allow for one team to go first? All the shootings should have been simultaneously…"
1,Stop turning into MR beast go back to trick shots that’s what you are known for

0,Bro dude perfect fell off😢
0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but. i simply only counted alex on this video as it didnt seem like any of the other games were fitting for a win given the massive teams and the lack of dp play. the final game was fine to me so i gave it to the last man standing. Alex.

ty - 36.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 18 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)
alex - 1

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious"

33,8:34 That was an amazing shot🎉❤
0,You guys should do school stereotypes
1,Do more of these ❤❤
0,"At the beginning of the video your battle is extremely unfair since blue team goes first, giving them a massive advantage. I simulated the scenario in sheets, and regardless of both teams accuracy or starting players, if they are equal, the team that goes first wins by a lot. I eventually discovered that the team that goes second will always need to hit 1/(the firsts accuracy-1).  In other words, If Blue goes first... if blue team hits 1 in 5 shots, red must hit 1 in 4 shots to even tie. Even if they both have terrible accuracy, and blue only hits 1 in 1,000,000 shots, red must hit 1 in 999,999 shots to tie.
If you ever want to do this again, you should make it fair. Make the rounds such that whichever team shoots second maintains all their players until after they have shot.
So say Red shoots first and hits 12 Blue people, those 12 Blue people stay on, and shoot back to hit the Red people. Then at the end of the round all ""hit"" players are out. This eliminates the shoot first win advantage and makes the game more fair. 
Or just make it an actual 100 vs. 100 battle like we though it was, on a battlefield, that would be proper cool.
I've been a fan for a long time, so I'm just happy to provide this feedback, No hate, just want you guys to be fair, and fun."

2,"unpopular opinion:
I have been a dude perfect fan for almost a decade now, but I just feel like lately their videos lack the personality that they had in their older videos, I feel like they started to become more like a Mrbeast channel with them being hosts of competitions instead of have the same 5 guys just being themselves, this is why I liked dude perfect, I feel like they have changed their style on youtube thinking that we as their audience want larger scale production and many participating contestants, but to me, the reason why I started watching dude perfect was because of the strong connection each of the dudes had built with us as their fans, and I just hope that dude perfect just realize that and return to that strong connection that they had once built with us."

0,Dudes just drop a new ot
1,"What happened to the dude perfect I loved? 🥀
It used to be the five main guys in every video competing in battles, overtime, etc. now every video it’s anyone but them- Staff, fans, other YouTubers, celebrities- Please stop trying to be Mr beast and go back to the main guys actually fully participating instead of just hosting things! I used to look forward to new videos all week but now I can’t even watch to the end. I subscribed for the five dudes, if I wanted to see random people compete in challenges I’d watch Me beast or something. Go back to your roots please!"
2,"I spy Surfer dude, let’s go Trevor! 🎉"
0,The first challenge should have shot at the same time.
0,"Not liking the Mr. Beast vibe here, keep the dudes in the center of action, not strangers :/"

I’m not saying that in hateful way, I just mean the content of their videos is completely different. Used to be 5 guys playing sports and goofing around, and now it’s like Mr. Beast. 

It’s just not what it once was. I miss the old days."

1,Let's go Alex! Guy I wanted fr
2,Trevor W!!! Get that man an AZTEC!!!!!! Love seeing that guy!!
1,This is TF2 with extra steps
0,7:02 it’s a little weird no one checked to verify that “Nathaniel” was a “Professional Call of Duty” player (spoiler: he’s not). You guys should probably stealth edit the “professional” part out of his name tag.
0,Brennan I know personally
0,Bro Angela P is literally my teacher
0,Today’s my birthday🎉🎉🎉 love to hear from The Dude Perfect
0,Red kinda got screwed by not going first cause they didn’t have as many shooters as blue in the first round for them and that continued till there was none left. Other then that great video!

0,hi
0,Dude perfect continues to think of something new time and time again. What will they think of next?!
0,First round had 43 people on each side
0,Dude perfect content is just becoming Mr Beast lite. Lacking the charm is connection of their older videos. These new videos have like a corporate feeling to them and lack personality. Just my opinion
1,Trevor W might be the best addition to this show ever. “ITS AIR SOFT NOT AIR HARD!”
0,LETS GO JESUS G
5,Where Are My OG DUDE PERFECT Subscribers?

Gotta admit, getting a bit annoyed at the favoritism towards TT."

0,dont think its battle royale if its 50/50 team
0,A 20 minute video is perfect
0,A 20 minute video is perfect
0,we need more airlift battles
1,"This is literally the most Mr Beast rip off Doo Doo I've ever seen. Literally the dudes are just sitting to the side on there phones. And why, do you feel the need to put other YouTubers in this video? Like no real dude perfect fan likes this! We waited 3 weeks! 3! For a ""Dude Perfect"" video with HEAVY quotations. we want to see the dudes and the dudes ONLY, no one wants to see some random high schooler in a dude perfect video! Maybe someday they'll learn being them selfs made them who they are. and making A.I Thumbnails and using rap/phonk music is not what dude perfect fans want. Just hope one of them sees this and hears the fans call, Put the dude back in perfect. Never, i mean NEVER put out a video like this ever again. I miss old dude perfect, it will never be the same."

0,love the vid
0,"That was very well done. My only criticism would be for the first round, taking turns firing is kind of silly and puts the second team at a significant disadvantage. If both teams fired at the same time it would be more fair, in my opinion. Other than that, very entertaining!"
0,Is it just me or do you watch dude perfect in school when you have nothing else to do?

0,Glad dude perfect is showing love to indiana
1,"i love how coby says, ""just 1000$"""
0,"Anybody else noting a marked INCREASE in pre-trickshot setup or speaking?

A lot of folks don't factor that into the trick shot, but they have to repeat that setup every single time until they get the take where they land the shot,  which is just so incredibly impressive to me, from a production standpoint."
0,half of these clips are old. Dumb
1,I've never seen a dude perfect video before but here I am because and only for CC 22.
0,I’m not trying to be that one guy but in trick shot 11 Cody  stepped on the line….
0,"@0:46 to do a bounce shot 3pointer in a doncic lakers jersey celebrating like yet another player is criminal.
Stephen Curry does the bounce shot 3pointer every warmup shootaround and he does them at decent accuracy.
There should be no other jersey and no other celly than the night night combined with this shot!"
0,"the victim mentality people dont like Clark, so now you have to get angel Reese and do a 50 ways to miss a lay up video HAHAHAHAHA"

0,The Caitlin shot over the backboard was amazing to witness in person!
0,"First time checking out these guys. And, it was disappointing. Click bait. Caitlin was on for about 3 minutes of a 17 minute video. Precisely what I hate about YouTube channels. They put 10 second clips of CC between other stuff that I didn’t come here to watch. So much for this channel. I shall keep browsing."
0,Next episode 50 ways to miss a lay up ft. angel reese
0,Angel Reese definitely disliked this video.
0,Editing style felt off on this one. Just me?
0,The stunt double granny made me audibly laugh. Nice
0,Way to go Caitlin Clark. Had zero interest in the wnba until Caitlin Clark happy to see her with the Dudes lets go! Go Caitlin!
0,Isn't she injured?
0,the way his grandma broke character after she scored 🤣🤣
0,Pin this comment. You should do around the world 3 point shots. Somebody from every country shoots a 3 point shot. All proceeds go to the top charity that gets tagged.

0,"I know, to a point, it would take some of the ""magic"" out of these, but I'd love to see them posted with the actual count of attempts it took. Would be way more interesting."
0,Somewhere Angel Reese is sad.
0,I kept waiting for the first officer to get docked in the face. Standing directly in front of a larger and clearly agitated (not to mention intoxicated) person is a quick way to get knocked out and your gun taken. That type of ineptitude seems to be a trend lately with certain police officers…
0,Should’ve done a piggy back 3-pointer❤❤
0,Overtime in 2025?
1,"disappointing, I thought this was going to be an overtime😒😒"

0,1:52 She is so excited but need to act like it is not thing at the same time🤣🤣🤣
0,"Came to see CC and was surprised to see no interview or even not much of Caitlin. Is this channel some kind of marketing experiment? I mean only hoops. I can probably get away with watching 2 videos, yet this channel has over 60 million subscribers, lol. They are marketing geniuses."

0,"1:17 Cody stepped on the line, therefore not a 3 and since Sparky hit 2 regular 3 pointers they do not count as a different way to score a 3, Garett's shot with a green guy didn't go in therefore there were only 48 3 pointers made and only 46 different ways (that worked) to make a 3 in this video."
1,The collaboration points ❤🎉❤ nice
0,On number 11 his foot was over the line
0,Um actually in the 11th shot he stepped on the line so therefore it was two so this video lies because the did only 49 threes not 50🤓🤓🤓

0,"I’ve seen this setup before. Early-stage, strong utility, and low MC — and Alaxio, it’s textbook no brainer."
0,Do Paige bueckers next!!!!!!

0,"Put 300 bucks in Alaxio and forgot about it. If it hits 100x, I’m quitting my job live."
0,I don't like Jackson!
0,Alaxio fundamentals are strong: AI + DeFi + smart contract auditing = a utility-based moonshot.
0,High-quality projects in low-cap phase are rare. Alaxio is one of them.
0,Smart money’s not chasing hype — they’re getting into strong presales like Alaxio ALX early.
0,The tech behind Alaxio ALX is more advanced than most of the top 100. It’s early still.

1,What happened to the second twin
0,indonesian track record is indian langguage🙏🏼🙏🏼
0,Can yall start making your videos a lot less childish please. I’ve been a fan of your channel from the beginning but you lost me with wheel unfortunate and rarely doing trick shots. I understand you want to cater to the younger/kids generation but this channel has gotten extremely childish. Idk who manages the videos and what yall produce but you need to act more mature with making your content. No one wants to watch a 40 year old act like Ned Flanders anymore. You can still make Christian content without acting like a four year old.
0,why this dubbing indonesia not like indonesia language💀💀
0,Thai❤
0,2030 anyone
1,"The Indonesian translation is wrong, it's not Indonesian"
0,"Hahaha, absolute CHAOS at the finish line"

0,Tbh the wheel at the end crossed the finish line lol
0,"The difference between Indonesia and India, why the Indonesian audio track uses Hindi"
0,That Wheel Coming out from Tyler’s Cart before making it to the finish was quite hilarious😂
0,Amazing ending bro TY HAD A CHANCE AND HIS FRICKIN FRACKIN WHEEL CAME OFF WHO DID MAKE THAT BOGUS SHIP😂😂😂
0,Cody
0,รอพากย์ไทยมานานแล้ว
0,เห้ ฉันดีใจที่ช่องนี้มีพากร์เสียงไทยแล้ว
0,The last run was fixed Jones turned to stp his speed to make it more interesting. The speed he was going he would of won by a 'mile'

0,Opp
0,That ending was insane 😂.

LeBron James: A Legacy Beyond the Game

Introduction and Early Life

LeBron Raymone James stands among the most iconic athletes of the 21st century, a name synonymous with basketball greatness, cultural influence, and social activism. As one of the most celebrated players in NBA history, James has redefined what it means to be a professional athlete—not only through his dominance on the court but also through his far-reaching impact off of it. Whether it’s leading a team to a championship, building a media empire, or opening a public school for underserved youth, LeBron’s influence transcends sports. His journey from a challenging upbringing in Akron, Ohio, to becoming a global icon is a story of perseverance, talent, and calculated vision.

Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, LeBron James was raised by his single mother, Gloria James, who gave birth to him at the age of 16. Life was difficult for the young James, as Gloria struggled to find steady employment and housing. The two often moved from apartment to apartment, living in some of Akron’s most economically challenged neighborhoods. LeBron’s early life was marked by instability and adversity, a stark contrast to the stability and success he would eventually create for himself and his family. Despite these challenges, Gloria did everything she could to provide for her son and shield him from the dangers of their environment. She recognized early on that her son had immense athletic potential and did her best to place him in situations where he could thrive.

LeBron’s life began to change dramatically in fourth grade when he started playing organized basketball. His natural ability was immediately apparent—he was fast, strong, and had a natural feel for the game. As he began playing on youth teams, coaches and parents alike took notice of his talent. One such influential figure was Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced LeBron to basketball and later became a stabilizing figure in his life. Recognizing the importance of structure, Walker and others in LeBron’s life provided the guidance and mentorship he needed to stay on a positive path.

By the time LeBron reached high school, he was already being heralded as a future NBA star. He attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school in Akron with a strong basketball program. From his freshman year, LeBron dominated high school basketball in a way that few had ever seen before. His team went undefeated in his first season, winning the state championship, and LeBron quickly became a national sensation. His high school games began to draw thousands of spectators, including celebrities and scouts from every major college and NBA team. He was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated as a junior—a rare feat for a high school athlete—with the headline “The Chosen One,” a title that would follow him throughout his career.

As his fame grew, so did the scrutiny. LeBron faced intense media attention and pressure to perform even before graduating high school. Every game he played was televised, analyzed, and critiqued. He became a symbol of promise and potential, and many wondered whether he could live up to the almost mythic expectations being placed upon him. Despite this, LeBron remained focused and grounded. He continued to lead his team to victories, winning three state championships in four years and finishing his high school career with an astonishing 101–6 record.

By 2003, LeBron James had become the most highly touted high school basketball player in history. Instead of attending college, he declared for the NBA draft directly out of high school—a decision that came with significant risk and reward. The Cleveland Cavaliers, holding the first overall pick in the draft, selected LeBron, making him the hometown hero for a franchise in desperate need of revival. From the moment he entered the league, the weight of expectation on his shoulders was immense. He wasn’t just a rookie; he was a savior, a brand, and a symbol of hope.

What separated LeBron even then, aside from his talent, was his maturity and understanding of the moment. He signed endorsement deals with Nike, Coca-Cola, and other major brands before playing a single professional game. At just 18 years old, LeBron became a millionaire and a business entity. Despite the distractions that come with fame and wealth, he never wavered in his commitment to excellence on the court.

LeBron’s early life and high school career laid the foundation for what would become one of the most legendary careers in sports history. His story is not just one of natural talent but also of resilience, discipline, and vision. From the streets of Akron to the national spotlight, he demonstrated the ability to handle pressure with poise and consistently deliver on expectations. His early years were a prelude to the greatness that would follow—both on the court and far beyond it.

NBA Career Highlights – Cleveland, Miami, and Los Angeles

When LeBron James entered the NBA in 2003 as the first overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers, he was not only the most anticipated rookie in decades but also a hometown savior for a franchise long mired in mediocrity. From the very beginning, LeBron showcased a rare combination of size, skill, basketball IQ, and poise. Standing 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighing around 250 pounds, with the agility of a guard and the power of a forward, he quickly proved that the hype was justified.

LeBron’s rookie season was nothing short of remarkable. He averaged 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game, earning the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Though the Cavaliers did not make the playoffs, LeBron’s arrival had transformed the team into a must-watch franchise. Over the next few years, he continued to elevate his play, developing into one of the league’s most versatile and dominant forces. By the 2005–06 season, he had led Cleveland to the playoffs, and in 2007, he carried an underdog Cavaliers team to the NBA Finals. Though they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron’s leadership and performance signaled the arrival of a generational superstar.

Despite his brilliance, the Cavaliers struggled to build a championship-caliber roster around him. Year after year, LeBron put up MVP-caliber numbers and led the team deep into the playoffs, but Cleveland’s lack of a true supporting cast limited their ceiling. After seven seasons without a title, LeBron made the most controversial decision of his career: in July 2010, he announced on national television that he would be “taking his talents to South Beach” and joining the Miami Heat.

However, from a basketball standpoint, the move made sense. In Miami, LeBron joined forces with fellow superstars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to form a “Big Three” that would dominate the NBA. LeBron evolved as a player during his time in Miami, refining his post game, improving his efficiency, and taking on a greater defensive role. He won two MVP awards in 2012 and 2013, and led the Heat to four straight NBA Finals appearances from 2011 to 2014.

The pinnacle of LeBron’s career came in 2016, when the Cavaliers staged one of the greatest comebacks in NBA history. Down 3–1 in the Finals to a 73-win Warriors team, the Cavaliers stormed back to win the series in seven games. LeBron delivered iconic performances, including a triple-double in Game 7 and the legendary chase-down block on Andre Iguodala.

After fulfilling his promise to Cleveland, LeBron signed with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. His first season was injury-plagued, but the 2019–20 campaign—paired with Anthony Davis—ended with a championship in the NBA bubble. At age 35, he secured his fourth NBA title and became the first player to win Finals MVP with three different franchises.

Through each phase—Cleveland, Miami, Cleveland again, and Los Angeles—LeBron has demonstrated an uncanny ability to lead, adapt, and dominate across different eras and systems, reinforcing his unique status as a transcendent athlete.

⸻

Championships, Accolades, and Career Achievements

LeBron James’ accolades span every conceivable category. He is a four-time NBA champion (2012, 2013, 2016, 2020), four-time league MVP (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013), and a four-time NBA Finals MVP. His performances in the postseason are legendary, from his 45-point elimination game against Boston in 2012 to his 2016 Finals masterpiece.

In 2023, he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer—a crowning achievement that encapsulated both his skill and longevity. LeBron has been named to the All-NBA First Team more than a dozen times, and he has been an NBA All-Star every year since 2005.

Beyond the numbers, LeBron has consistently led his teams in scoring, rebounding, and assists. He is the only player in league history to amass over 40,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a statistical trifecta that underscores his all-around dominance.

LeBron’s greatness is not just in accumulation but in impact: his presence on the floor changes the geometry of the game, forcing defenses to adjust, coaches to strategize differently, and teammates to elevate their play.

Off-the-Court Ventures – Business, Activism, and Philanthropy

LeBron’s off-court legacy is as formidable as his basketball career. As a businessman, he’s built a billion-dollar empire through smart investments, brand partnerships, and ownership stakes—including Nike"

0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 22 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 37.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 22 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 19 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious"

1,Dude perfect still going strong in 2025
8,"I been putting this same comment in all of your videos for a while now. We haven’t gotten a stereotype video in months. You guys have came up with so many unique themes, but YOU NEED TO MAKE “School Stereotypes”. There could be so many things like “School Supply Freak” who has every pen or marker imaginable, The School Mascot” who is being followed by every kid in the school, and the “Rage Monster” can be one of the most biggest school classics. Ty getting an F on a test and Cody showing off because he got an A. They can make “easy teacher”, and “strict teacher”, and that strict teacher WOULD HAVE TO BE Sparky. If anybody agrees, please like this comment so Dude Perfect thinks they should make School Stereotypes too. 💯 👍

0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 37.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 19 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious (i know im late to this one)"

Four members of the group, Jones being an exception, were brothers of the Gamma chapter of the Beta Upsilon Chi fraternity at A&M.

• Chapter 1 - The Tall Guy: Cody Jones, a.k.a. “Tall Guy” for a reason. Measuring in at six-and-a-half feet, you may not always hear Cody coming, but you’ll definitely see him. As the resident goofball of the dudes, he loves to keep things loud, joke around, and make sure everyone’s laughing.

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Easy 
• Hero Type: Vanguard 
• Faction: Knights

Yet somehow, he is convinced the best is still ahead of him. One minute older than Cory Cotton, you’ll most likely find him with a smile on his face, sipping on a cold glass of chocolate milk. Cory, his tough luck twin, is the Michael Jordan of Unfortune. He’s the all-time leader in wheel spins, and if a Get Crafty is in play, for your own safety...stay away. He loves playing basketball, is a milkshake connoisseur, a sneakerhead, and a slowly improving golfer. More than anything, though, he loves to ride those little rental scooters that are all over the place in big cities.

• Coby and Cory Cotton are the Shinobi ♂️/♀️ | Mobile Skirmisher | Counter-Attacker 

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Hard  
• Hero Type: Assassin

• Chapter 4 - The Purple Hoser: As the “dad” of the dudes, Garrett Hilbert spends much of his time cleaning around the office, balancing the budget, and keeping the group organized. Generally, he’s the most responsible of the bunch, but even the Purple Hoser has his moments—especially when it comes to springing for cool new office toys.

• Garrett Hilbert is the Black Prior ♂️/♀️ | Defense Specialist | Strong Support Abilities 

• Gender: Male
• Difficulty: Medium 
• Hero Type: Heavies

The Rage Monster could be Ty getting an F on a test after studying and Cody showing off with an A+. You can make “ the school supply freak” where one of the dudes ask for a pencil from a friend and they have a supply case the size of a suitcase. You can make “ the most iconic kid in school”. You can make “ the strict teacher” and the teacher would have to be Sparky. There are just SO MANY funny stereotypes you guys can put in this video. YOU GUYS NEED TO MAKE School Stereotypes💯, and if you do, it’ll probably be my favorite stereotypes you guys have made.

0,Jackson is a cool guy
0,"im back

if anyone was wondering, after going through and noting down the winner of each battle as i was wondering myself, just how many has ty won and how many has coby won. but here you go. the draw that happened resulted in a .5 for both sides so you can take it away, make it a whole point or leave it as is, up to you. i've included the amount of wins that were team wins if you feel they dont count. they are included here in the numbers (cody's 21 includes his 7 team wins) but you can simply subtract them if you want. please do correct me if i made a mistake. im pretty confident im correct but.

ty - 36.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
cody - 21 (7 are team wins)
cory - 16.5 (6 are team wins and 1 draw)
coby - 17 (10 are team wins)
garret - 18 (4 team wins)

extra people
panda - 1 (1 team win)
sparky - 1 (1 team win)
luke the editor - 1
mark rober - 1
jackson - 1 (1 team win)

again, please do correct me if im wrong but this was just me being curious"

459,"Part of the genius behind the creation of this battle is that there is a nice and fair mixture of individual competitive, team competitive, and hybrid competitive with the mini games and ways to thrive in the challenges. Typically, Tyler wins individual battles but loses team battles while Coby dominates team battles but loses individual battles. The elimination challenge was a near perfect balance between individual competitive and team competitive."

The challenges were amazing, and all of the twists and turns were fun to watch (especially when Jackson was just so much fun to watch…alongside Tyler not stabbing him in the back with that advantage). Also it was nice to see yellow team win for the first time…great job Tyler and Jackson. When the forth Survival Games eventually comes out in the future, let’s see if blue team can comeback from this a get a third win. Great job as always Dude Perfect and I can’t wait to see what you guys do next."

0,If anyone think this is easy they haven’t played baseball in any league baseball is not easy
0,"Dude, perfect you sponsored my school but I love all the stuff you offer"
0,🤕😬wow
0,When the ball got stuck in the dummy’s shoulder it immediately reminded me of the comebacks where the ball gets lodged in his hand 😂😂😂😂
0,I might run the numbers later.  I’m sure it would be easy to write an equation where you could plug in the baseball speed and it would tell you how fast it gets to home plate.  It should be a linear equation.  But at 200 MPH I’m guessing you’d have to start swinging no later than when the ball is fired because it would get there fast.  At 1000 MPH you’d have to start swinging before the ball is fired but if it hit you you’d almost surely die.  It would be like a bullet BUT its Mass would be so much bigger.
0,Jesus love you all

0,I watched a guy do this throwing darts on night in Lake City MN but throwing darts at at a MN board .I called out the shot he hit it. Pete Kenabeck was his name if I remember wright.
5,The slow-motion shots of the bat absorbing that impact are insane! Imagine the data you could collect with a setup like this; maybe even help design better equipment for player safety.
0,"So glad Skenes came to LSU and helped win us the world series. I just watched highlights from his 8 inning shut out of wake forest to put us in the world series finals against florida. Dude can hit too. He didn't hit for LSU but when he was at air force he did. I'm pretty sure he hit double digit home runs his last year at air force. Having him, dylan crews and tommy white on the same team just wasn't fair."

0,The HR lads would hit it
0,Why is no one talking about Linus?
0,I still love watching Dude Perfect❤
0,next usain bolt

1,He should be in the MLB
0,Imagine being at a baseball park and randomly being nailed by a golf ball 🤣
1,But you guys can do it
1,That’s almost impossible
0,To be fair - Destin at Smarter Every Day did the baseball cannon a number of years ago
0,Why didn't they just get in touch with Destin at Smarter Every Day? He already made a baseball cannon.
0,I know when you’re changing the thumbnail and title…you need more views 😅 so i gave you my view. You’re welcome loool
0,Dude perfect videos are getting worse and worse

0,"Back in my day I could throw a 200 mph fastball. How much you wanna bet I could throw a baseball over them mountains. Coach woulda put me in 9th inning we would’ve been state champions, no doubt, no doubt in my mind."
2,"Wait....

I'm confused 😆"
0,Top Ten rage monster needs to happen next overtime
0,A bit of How Ridiculous about this great Video!

0,This is MysthBusters-level content here
0,Not a fastball. That’s knuckling so hard.
0,Ty hit it let’s goooo
0,I wish the SloMo guys would’ve been there.  Being able to see the energy travel down that bat and into your arms with real slow motion would’ve been incredible.

0,"Skenes hitting a target blindfolded, Gunnar hitting bombs, DP going Sports Science on us. This was awesome!"

0,What does Ty's shirt mean? Let's go 05

0,The lead is buried so far you'll need a baseball cannon to unearth it.
0,Mythbusters would be proud of your air cannon!
1,A smarter guy named Destin made this months ago...
0,Happy Birthday Tyler🎉🎉🎉
0,Great ad!
5,Tyler definitely had a say so in that cannon design. It’s basically a giant Barrett flash hide. Only Tyler would make sure the barrel was semi accurate
0,0:35 I have that glove
0,Is it 1000mph or 200mph?
0,I want a video of the conversation with their insurance company when they proposed this!!

5,Real weak job trying to blur Easton out at 11:02 lol
1,"A little bit of constructive criticism for the DP producers: This video, along with some recent ones, feel like they’re really veering away from what dp is all about. This whole video just felt like an ad for the video game. It had no uniformity or organization. It was sort of just random things pieced together. Was it a battle? A bucket list? 

It also feels way too similar to the one you guys did with the rangers last year. And then theres videos like the recent carvana one that felt like one big long ad. It had no pacing and it was not entertaining. It also felt like a much lamer version of the trick shot championship video. Watching random millennials compete in basic games isn’t what we’re subscribed for. We want to see the five dudes we grew up with in classic series like battles and overtime. Nobody wants to watch “Chad and Jackson” go on a half hearted amazing race that has two steps and is so obviously a carvana ad. Heck, your audience is primarily 8 year olds. Who’s using carvana? And other parts like the basketball game that felt endless and the spelling bee were also uninspiring. Most people wouldn’t find a spelling be interesting even if they knew the participants. Let alone random people we’ve never heard of. 

Overall, less ads, less strange, unorganized one off videos, and more of the classics we’ve grown to love."

14,0:16 Cody is still a Luka fan after the 11-0 1v1 AND the AD deal. That trade is prob top 3 worst things to happen to Dallas. As a Mavs fan (not Luka fan) I had to watch Nico flush the team's franchise guy then the entire roster implode.

But when that bat just came to a dead stop when the ball hit it... yeah, any faster and you are breaking an arm."
0,when is the cannon getting tj
0,Why haven’t you guys made your own bat brand at this point? Saw that you blocked the logo of the other bat company. Should think about making your own brand!

1,Awesome video post dude perfect
0,the fact that the ball got from 200 mp/h to 0 mp/h when hit means that ty's hit was also near 200 mp/h
0,"As always mate, absolute legend 🤌🏼. Nailed it."
0,Tyler definitely had a say so in that cannon design. It’s basically a giant Barrett flash hide. Only Tyler would make sure the barrel was semi accurate
0,was funny to see the easton logo on the bat be clear  for a second  then blurred for the rest of the slo mo video.
0,Well Tyler fasho earned a like
0,You guys earned a like
0,Dude Perfect always hitting records

6,I don't believe that cannon gets near 1000 mph. Smarter everyday did a fantastic video on getting a baseball to hit 1000 mph and there are a few key steps they had to employ to get the ball there. They had to pull a vacuum in the barrel which we can see you arent doing. Its no doubt impressive and you only need it to go 200 mph but I think the folks that built it convinced themselves it was going faster than it was
1,Skenes W😂❤🎉
0,You guys have king of juko try to hit.
1,"You guys should get Bryce Harper in the next video, go phillies"

Hitting the rim and missing the shot scores a point, from behind the 3 point line you get 2 points from hitting the rim and missing.

0,"Die Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) hielt am 20. März 2024 eine Anhörung ab: „Das Verbrechen des Organraubs beenden: Was sollte noch getan werden?“ Vier Zeugen sagten während der Anhörung aus und erläuterten detailliert, welche Maßnahmen zur Beendigung der erzwungenen Organentnahme durch die Kommunistische Partei Chinas (KPCh) ergriffen werden können.



Die Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) hielt am 20. März 2024 eine Anhörung ab, um die Zwangsentnahme von Organen in China zu beenden.

CECC-Präsident: „Eine Gräueltat von beispielloser Perversität“
Chris Smith, US-Repräsentant und Vorsitzender des CECC, eröffnete die Anhörung, indem er ihre Bedeutung hervorhob: „Dies ist eine wichtige Anhörung, in der es um eine der hartnäckigsten und schrecklichsten Menschenrechtsverletzungen unserer Zeit geht, die jedoch leider nicht die Aufmerksamkeit und Verurteilung erfahren hat, die sie verdient.“ Er hat bereits zwei Anhörungen im US-Kongress abgehalten und erklärt, Organraub sei unvorstellbar und inakzeptabel.



Der US-Repräsentant und CECC-Vorsitzende Chris Smith moderierte die Anhörung am 20. März 2024.

Unter Berufung auf frühere Feststellungen des China-Tribunals von Sir Geoffry Nice aus dem Jahr 2019 sagte Smith, das Tribunal sei „einstimmig und zuversichtlich und ohne jeden vernünftigen Zweifel zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass in China die Zwangsentnahme von Organen an Gefangenen aus Gewissensgründen schon seit geraumer Zeit praktiziert wird und eine beträchtliche Zahl von Opfern betrifft“. Genauer gesagt waren die Hauptopfer Falun-Dafa-Praktizierende und Uiguren.

„Chinas Organraub im industriellen Maßstab ist eine Gräueltat von beispielloser Perversität“, erklärte Smith und fügte hinzu: „Die Zahl der Menschen, die wegen ihrer Organe hingerichtet werden, manche sogar bevor sie hirntot sind, ist erschütternd.“ Aus diesem Grund hat das chinesische Tribunal den staatlich geförderten Organraub in China als „Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit“ eingestuft.

Vor etwa einem Jahr verabschiedete das Repräsentantenhaus mit überwältigender Mehrheit von 413 zu 2 Stimmen den „Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act“, und Smith forderte den Senat auf, das Gesetz „bis zum Ende durchzuziehen“. Dieses bahnbrechende, parteiübergreifende Gesetz ermächtigt den Außenminister, jedem, der in den illegalen Organhandel in China und weltweit verwickelt ist, Pässe und Visa zu verweigern. Darüber hinaus verlangt das Gesetz vom Außenministerium jährliche Berichte über die Zwangsentnahme von Organen weltweit und sieht Sanktionen gegen Personen und Organisationen vor, die den Organhandel begünstigen.

„Schweigen ist inakzeptabel, insbesondere von medizinischen Verbänden und Unternehmen. Wenn sie schweigen, riskieren sie die Mittäterschaft bei einem Verbrechen gegen die Menschlichkeit“, schloss Smith und fügte hinzu: „Wenn wir jetzt nicht handeln, werden noch viel mehr Menschenleben verloren gehen.“"

0,"भारत के इतिहास में आजतक ऐसी विडियो कभी नहीं आई। हमारे इतिहासकार बताते हैं कि 967 साल पहले किसी ने ऐसी वीडियो डाली थी,, लेकिन उसके बाद आज ऐसी वीडियो देखने को मिली है। बहुत ही सुंदर विडियो आज देखने को मिली है। अत्यधिक चमत्कारी पूरी तरह से हृदय को झंझोर देनी वाली वीडियो हैं। आपको जरूर कोई अवार्ड मिलना चाहिए। आपके चेहरे की चमक देखकर लगता है की पहली बार कोई महान चेहरा चीर जगत में अवतरित हुआ है। सारे मानव जाति को चौंका कर रखा है। वीडियो में लोहे और अंबुजा सीमेंट जैसी मजबूती हैं। जैसे ही आपने वीडियो अपलोड किया है, संसार में ढोल नगाड़ों का गूंजना शुरू हो गया है। कई देशों के लोगो को ये जानकर आश्चर्य हुआ कि इस तरह का चेहरा अवतरित कैसे हुआ। धन्यवाद आपको जो आपने अपनी जान जोखिम में डालकर इतनी महत्वपूर्ण सूचना हमें दी है। अद्भभुत सूचना सुनकर तीनों लोको में आपकी बहुत प्रसन्नता है। आपके समाचार सुनकर पूरे ब्रह्मांड में खुशी की लहर छाई है, मानो चारो ओर एक दिव्य ज्योति प्रज्वलित हुई हो। आगे भी सृष्टि के कल्याण के लिए ऐसी सूचना देते रहे। तीनों लोक आपके सदा आभारी रहेंगे। अगर ये खबर लोगो को न मिलती तो मानव और जीव जंतु अपने जीवन के घनघोर अंधकार में डूबे रहते। धन्यवाद आपको आज तो मैं भी आपकी वीडियो देखकर धन्य हो गया। सोच रहा हूं आपका कर्ज कैसे उतारू? धन्यवाद आपको और आप हमेशा इस प्रकार हमारे सामने आते रहे!"

0,"I dont find trick shots to be that impressive, i mean given enough attempts any shot can and will be made so..."
0,Should’ve known Brodie was getting that disc toss first.

0,Trick Shot Queen is build like a Monster Truck !!!

0,"The one thing that I do respect about this video, besides the lack of degeneracy I can't mention and their young generation of brainwashed/conditioned of an audience might not be able to tell... Only the most based of noticers will know what I mean 🙋🏻‍♂️"
0,"Body Armor ""Sports"" Drink 🤡 ... Instead of drinking chemicals drink water and green tea. 
Like Mr. ""Beast"" claiming a healthy candy bar, when in reality it's the cheapest thing to make for the most profit like these garbage drinks they promote. 
These people ONLY care about money when they already live VERY WELL... When will it be enough 🤷🏻‍♂️"

0,"Should have crowned a LET'S GOOO champion too, must be a record, more than a Mr Beast video"
0,Is that Carson from juggling Josh?

0,"I think it would be better if they didn't eliminate teams right away. Like just keep the teams in the game, but give them points based on where they place. Seems a bit rough to make the trip there and get knocked out in the 1st round. Fun video!"

0,"Love that y'all, the OGs of trick shots, decided to create a world championship and kept yourselves out of it.

0,"Audience Supports Falun Gong
Daniel Goodwin, who works in the legal field, heard about Falun Gong in 2018. After watching the documentary, he said that more people should be made aware of the CCP’s crime of live organ harvesting. “Many people don’t know about this yet,” he said, “but they should know about this atrocity. I started to learn about it in 2018.”


Daniel Goodwin condemned the persecution of Falun Gong.

“The CCP doesn’t just persecute Falun Gong,” he said. “Now the CCP is also persecuting people from other groups. But the CCP mostly persecutes Falun Gong practitioners.”

As a Christian, he expressed his support for Falun Gong practitioners’ freedom of belief.

Dr. Li, a cardiologist, watched the documentary with her husband. She said, “I knew the CCP persecuted Falun Gong, but I didn’t know the persecution was so severe, with one hundred million people being persecuted. I didn’t know the CCP specifically persecuted Falun Gong before. China has such a big problem, and the CCP is wrong to do this.”

Patty Willett, retired from a Silicon Valley computer company, wept while she watched the documentary. “It was the first time I heard about Falun Gong,” she said. “Seeing them being persecuted made me feel very sad and tears came to my eyes. I could feel what their parents had to endure. I couldn’t bear to watch some parts.”


Patty Willett, a retired Silicon Valley employee

Ms. Willett said Falun Gong was completely new to her. “I like the principles of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance. This touches me. They have spiritual beliefs. What happened to them [organ harvesting] is unacceptable to me.

“Especially because they are so kind,” she said, “it’s unacceptable to cut up their bodies while they are still alive. The parents are looking for their children, but they can’t find them. It’s heartbreaking.”

Denys, a software engineer from Ukraine, said, “We never heard of Falun Gong before. Today, we not only learned about Falun Gong, but also about the CCP’s crimes against humanity.”


Hannah (left) and Denys (right) from Ukraine

Hannah, also from Ukraine, said, “The CCP is evil, and communism is evil. Just like the Soviet Union, communism is evil everywhere. I hope this film can play a role. Exposure will help. Exposing the evil of communism will cause the CCP to disintegrate.”

This wasn’t the first time Erica Hathaway, a pet sitter, had heard about the CCP’s persecution of Falun Gong and its crime of forced organ harvesting. After watching the documentary, she gained a deeper understanding of the extent of the CCP’s crimes. “I knew that the CCP was harvesting organs from living people, but I didn’t know it was on such a large scale, with so many people being detained and their organs harvested for profit.”


Erica Hathaway admires Falun Gong. 

Ms. Hathaway admires Falun Gong practitioners’ firm belief. “They are persecuted to death for their belief, which shows that they are very firm in their belief. I pray for them and hope that the persecution will end soon.”

She said that the documentary is excellent. “It is credible. All the information is credible, and it’s well-made. It’s portrayed in such a direct way that makes people feel that something must be done about it.”"

1,"I can comfortably say, this is officially the greatest video I have ever watched on YouTube."
0,"Absolute crazy win by That'll Work cuz they went through ALL the rounds to win it all, never got a bye. I think his greatest strength is just his consistency, the ability to narrow down the range of error and have each attempt fall into a similar area. All of them got crazy accuracy, but That'll Work just has that greater precision to narrow down his attempts into a smaller area, shown by how he hit the rim 3 times on the last challenge."
1,this might be top 3 greatest DP videos and the boys didn't attempt a single shot haha
0,❤❤❤
0,"Hey boys, its been a hot minute since the last all sports battle, considering the world championship video here, why not make it an all sports world championship video?"

0,Second and third place would have been nice though.
0,Nice vid guys
0,very entertaining video
0,"What this video shows me is that talented people can do anything if they put there mind to it. Because all these teams have grit, and determination and could despite not there specialties get close and eventually make any kind of trickshot thrown in front of them."
0,2 minutes for the finale ? Like wtf dudes. That needed a bit more flare. Like literally not even 2 minutes spent on the finales. Bit sad
0,They should do this yearly
0,DP has officially become the Mr. Beast of the trick shot world. 😂 Love your stuff gentleman! :D😊
2,"Seeing that there's a desire to do this annually... my suggestion... some sort of group stage where they get points across multiple tricks. Hate seeing someone go home on the first trick even though I'm not familiar with them. Especially in an industry that is just as much about determination and never giving up as it is about skill.
*EXAMPLE:*
*- 2 Groups of 4 =* All teams compete in a set of 3 or 4 tricks. Teams get points based on their finishing order in their group for each trick (5, 3, 2, 1). 
*- Finals =* The winners of each group qualify directly to the finals. The two 2nd place teams compete head-to-head in the next trick, Winner of that goes into the 3-team final with the group winners.

This would allow teams to potentially benefit from their specialities, while not being doomed if the first trickshot is something they've never done before."

1,I love trick shot queen
0,Next time don’t do elimination. It’d be more fun for everyone to see everyone try everything and get to show their strengths. And instead of a head to head competition do it more like the X games where everyone gets a “run” in certain scenarios or with specific equipment. Then you judge them and give them scores. The winner from this year could be a judge too.
0,"Oha, Nice trickshots"
0,FIRE
0,I love the collaboration with other streamers. Dude perfect never disappoints.
0,This is a surprise thing but it seems really cool.

Our family have been long time viewers and we're coming to tour. Praying you guys stay wholesome and Jesus focused."

2,"There should be a competition with home field advantage next year. Of the 8 teams, the first 3 to get the trick shot gets home field advantage. Then elimination rounds eliminating 2 more, then they travel to their corresponding opponent (1v6, 2v5, 3v4) as an away team. Then, the three who lost play 2 elimination rounds, and the three who won play 2 safety rounds. The one team that didn’t get into safety plays the winner of the loser for the final spot in the championship."

0,Kind of strange to make your employees compete for one of you to win a lambo🤔
0,I have the same huggie xD
0,"So sad. As a Believer, it lights a fire in my soul (in a bad way) to watch already-wealthy Believers (NOTHING wrong with being a wealthy Believer!) not only flaunt their purchasing power in front of those that help give them that power but they add insult to injury when they ask (require???) their staff to compete for them so that they can flaunt that purchasing power in front of their staff. Disgusting. 

DP, you should have left it at one of your staffers wins a Lambo but not gone as far as one of you winning a Lambo off the skin of their backs - or just skipped that awful episode altogether. 

Also, did your staffers volunteer to be a part of this episode or were they required &/or coerced/cornered to be a part of it? Just asking because as a fellow Believer I certainly would preach some bold Pauline-esque Words to the DP crew if I were presented with an ""opportunity"" to compete for one of you to win a Lambo. Can't you eat at home?! Why do you gorge yourselves in front of those less fortunate when you gather? Ya know, that's just off the top of my head...go look the verse up if you need an exact quote. Nasty.

I'm correcting you in public because you errored in public."
0,Maybe its just me but I dont love this turn that they seem to have taken into Mr Beast type content. It feels less genuine then their other videos. One or two is fine but I really hope this isnt the direction they maintain.

Lamborghini Urus, around $250,000. For a car to be completely assembled by hand in Italy that price starts to make scenes. Then the high-performance materials, the 3 testing fazes, and overseas shipping on top of that, ok. I mean, they made a 110 mph treadmill for the car."

0,"Here's an idea. I'll try and keep it short bowling. Y'all do 10th frame, roll off best one wins. It's pretty short video.
Golf one hole shootout elimination too closes to the hole
Plays three golf holes, low score wins of course
Tennis hard to explain but I'll try and keep it. It's simple.
Names in hat pic opponents best out of 3 points.
Top 2 play a full round against each other.
Baseball home run Derby 3 hits each total yards winds, top 2.
Then the top 2 do a 20 hit or 10 hit home run. Derby, most home runs win.
Basketball, the 3 point shootout, where they have the balls lined up. Besscore wins.
Soccer hit the goal from 4 points of the field top 2 does a kick off against each other? Where they score a goal and the other has to score.
Hockey, same thing as Soccer.
Football do a throwing thing like the pro bowl does where they compete, who gets the most points.
Frisbee, same as football.
Badminton, same as Tennis.
Go carts  you already did
Some of these I know you already did, but I'm talking about, like you would see a profession will do it. I'd like the 10th frame roll off that happens during competition.
If that sounds boring, you can add stuff to make it funner.
Or hmm, the crazy stuff y'all do like, instead of a bowling ball, it's a baseball or other stuff y'all come up with."

It ruins a lot of suspense for me when I know the 2 dudes that will be in the finale because of the ""Coming up"" teasers, and makes many of the games that the employees played feel less significant. I knew it was gonna be Tyler and cory in the finale since their battle colors are yellow and green."

0,"Hudson Institute Director Shea: I Don’t Believe the CCP Regime

Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank, speaks at a press conference on September 4, 2024.

Nina Shea, Director of Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, said during the press conference, “I salute Mr. Cheng for his courage. He is the only survivor [of live organ harvesting] to publicly stand up against this horrific atrocity, and we need to hear his voice.”

Shea said that when she met Mr. Cheng last week, she saw the scars left by the operation on his body up close, checked the scans, and read the doctor’s and expert reports. Shea said, “I believe him, I believe he is a survivor of the CCP’s live organ harvesting. I don’t believe the Chinese government, I don’t believe the CCP, because the CCP has always lied, confused the public, spread false information, and covered up the facts.”

Shea said that [live organ harvesting] is still happening, and she doesn’t believe it will stop unless there is an international independent investigation team to investigate.


Former Congressman Frank Wolf addressed the press conference.

Frank Wolf, who served as a U.S. congressman for 34 years, expressed anger at some mainstream media in the United States for avoiding the issue of organ harvesting from living people in China. He asked at the press conference, “Where is The Washington Post?”

He thanked Mr. Cheng and said, “It takes great courage. If a person has experienced all this, they would want to forget it completely.”

Wolf said that the CCP’s organ harvesting from living people has been known for many years, and people have learned about it at rallies and other events, and it’s already known to everyone. He said, “Our government has failed the Chinese people on this issue.”

Like Congressman Wolf, Hudson Institute Director Shea is concerned about this. “Our outstanding medical schools and universities have become accomplices, providing research and training programs to China.” The records of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) show that American universities have trained 344 (Chinese) transplant doctors.

Shea said that the medical schools heard about this crime against humanity, but they have not even raised questions, nor have they asked China where the organs came from, or asked them to confirm the source of the organs.

Wolf proposed to bring legal action against doctors, institutions, hospitals, training centers, etc. in the United States and other Western countries that participated in the CCP’s organ harvesting to stop this behavior."

1,"It's so hard to come to terms with that this group came from average beginnings,  making people happy with videos,  and now flaunt their wealth to their viewers, who are mostly young kids. They did well for themselves, and that's great for them.  It's so sad to see the lost tact and awareness of who their audience is and the affect and effect on them.  Benevolence is really lost in our country today."

0,"I find spelling in English to be inferior. Spelling things in Welsh is so much better. If you say the letters by themselves in English, for example say A and E by themselves and then say the word ""apple"", they sound different than in a word. Welsh doesn't have that, they remain the same so simply spelling a word is just saying it exactly how it would sound but at a slower pace."

1122,Yeahh ! Already 452K views ! and they dont buy views with FruityViews ! so cool ahah
1,"In my humble opinion this is the worst DP video of all time. It felt like a half hearted attempt to copy mr beast videos. Fans watch this channel because it’s unique, so please don’t just try to be like everyone else! I found it confusing and hard to follow. A lot going on at once, and pacing was all over the place. Some parts took a minute, and then something like the 1v4 basketball felt like it was half the video.

And the biggest issue is just the video itself. I personally only really watch to see the five dudes we grew up with. I don’t really care about watching employees I’ve never heard of. And the overtime, trick shots, battles and stereotypes are just better.

Plus the constant carmax advertising was annoying. And pointless considering the fact that I’d imagine about 95% of your viewers are 12 or younger.

Please go back to the old type of content!"
0,Dp and mr beast upload at the same time

0,I was trying to be strong on not back this and then I watched this video and paused midway through to back it. This is the first time you have failed me this bad Chris. I just can’t resist the new classes. My new goal is to just back the base game. I love this game so much it hits the table regularly. The unique classes are so awesome. For changing the difficulty we just added an extra roaming monster spawn point and that makes our win percentage about 50%
1,So this was basically editor edition 3. I love it! Keep it up DP!

I competed in scripps spelling bee in 2023 and 2024 so this was fun. but instead of 3 spellers there were 245. and there were more reliable judges. and the spellers were middle schoolers. and it was in Washington DC. and the nametags were yellow. and I use the method chad used to spell steep.
1,"Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come. 
Thy Will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.
For the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory are yours now and forever"

0,"Hopefully I'm not jumping the gun before I watch this video, but contests like this really bug me. I don't know who's competing in this, but the average person couldn't even afford to insure an Lamborghini, or pay for the gas in the engine. Maybe I'm thinking too much about this, but if you're going to do a giveaway, why not make it something practical that people can actually use ... like a cash prize. A Lamborghini feels like such an elitist move to me. I can't help thinking that the guys from Dude Perfect are starting to lose touch with reality."
0,"Let’s go Dude Perfect, I just wanted to let you know that I love your channel and a watch you all the time👍"
