0,Build an EATS road 😌
1,King of the ladder was always my favorite episode of MindCrack. Such a good throwback mentioning that lmao
2,"I went through literally every perspective, and while there were six people at the bottom of the tower, only Pearl happened to catch the point at which the tower fell... but was too far away to see what happened. Everyone else was either turned away or looking at the top of the tower, so there were no witnesses for Etho's alibi. The tunnel definitely makes it seem like he didn't pull the trigger... but he IS the one who built the tower. Pearl did technically see Grian's name underground for just a second, though.

They could've created plausible deniability by setting off TNT to make it seem like a Creeper blew up the bottom of the tower... they wouldn't even need to break the sand, would they? A torch being under the sand will always be suspicious, but if the would tower just drops a couple blocks, all of the ladders will still pop off, right? They could've gotten away with very little suspicion"
0,Bdubs is so clingy and possessive it’s hilarious.
0,Are the diamonds from the dragon because of the version or a plugin/mod?
0,That was absolutely insane
1,I use to watch you play Dwarves vs zombies with pause yearssss ago. happy to see you are still going

1,I laughed like Guude so much when you suggested king of the ladder. Old times 👏
0,After watching cleos video and actually seeing she was behind everyone when the tower fell I realized something you could literally see where every one was on the tower by the order that they died because Big b and skizz were on top and tango had just knocked off big b when they tower fell cleos was the first one that died meaning she was in last place at the time and big b than tango than skizz died meaning not only was skizz first to the top he was still there when the Tower fell meaning Cleo played you and you owe him some diamonds lol

All the interactions were amazing, top tier trio, great idea and execution..

 We appreciate you big time man, thanks for the amazing content all these years"
1,did they get away with it? I don't think they got away with it. but oh well it was really awesome
4,It's funny how etho probably is the only one who has enough healthy paranoia to be able to figure out that there's a secret society killing people but he's the one who got chosen to be part of it lol
3,my favorite part of this episode is watching them struggle with bedrock reagen.
0,"Man, I used to love watching King of the Ladder on the old Mindcrack. Great memories....and an even greater octo-kill!"

5,Ladders. I go up and go down
2,So that's why Pearl's teammates kept leaving her behind in the episode...

7,"50:05  love how gem and pearl immediately joined his side, even though he’s being prosecuted by the entire server, they stuck by him"
1,I think even if the tower wasn't dropped there would've been at least two kills anyway if you gave them a couple minutes lmao (I really wanted to see them play king of the ladder)
7,"Hindsight is 20/20, but I wonder how much better Etho's involvement could have been concealed if he had acted more upset and less willing to give up on his own game once ""someone else turned it into a trap,"" and rebuilt it out of dirt or something out of a lake so that the game could be played (""safely this time, since apparently you can't include any risk without getting exploited!"") for the diamond block."
0,"I appreciate BDubs calling out all of the dark greens for being pansies when they aren't willing to take a risk for a thing that would be fun and make their episodes more entertaining. Even despite the fact that it does turn out that the thing was rigged against them, the man understands improv and the fact that the people who are doing the best have very little actual excuse not to ""Yes, and"" to a good setup when the cost for things going badly is just losing a fraction of their lead!
Paranoia makes for good television to a point, but so does engaging with games, as does an 8-player multi-kill."
0,oh i loved watching this episode
1,"“I’m not like the glue or anything, I’m just one wacky guy.” lol"
0,"definitely think the society failed this one, grian said that they have to not suspect it was a boogey kill, and everyone almost exclusively called out etho, grian, and gem for the kill, especially at the end where bdubs directly called the whole thing out exactly"

I mean I get that he wants to be in the lead of design, but surely this is the place to step aside, to instead of dictating, suggesting, leaving it up to his team to implement or not (and which episode to introduce them, if at all)? Many of these ideas are applicable across the different Life series anyway, so it's not that important to get them in play right away."

0,king of the ladder is still one of my fav mindcrack episodes. I rewatch atleast once a year haha
0,kotl as a trap concept is perfect because it's literally right around the update they're playing in that the game was created. everyone bought into the flimsy sand tower bc it's freakin kotl hosted by etho in the nostalgia series lmao anyone would want to participate. just perfect all around. i only wish grian had had smooth stone or something to cover up the tunnel better lol
0,Was that what it was like watching the twin towers fall?

0,Something about Gem and Grian getting framed for 8 counts of murder while Etho manages to walk away with 2 strength potions and a pat on the back really tickles me.
0,"Good thing the Secret Society was composed of three of the best Among Us players in the group. (Yes, yes, I know - Scott)

The funniest thing to me is that Gem said the same thing about blocking with the sword, just about at the same time as you did."
0,such a good episode
1,"I am in awe. I laughed so hard my face hurt by the end. Between Etho having to lie to his team, Bdubs freaking out about Etho sneaking around, and all the other Cabin Boys drama, this episode was so funny, I'm going to be thinking about it for days. Can't wait to see what kind of hijinks comes from ""team bonding"" next week, but I'm praying this team can hold it together because they're all so entertaining together."
0,"God I hope your cabin boys DO watch your video, I can't stand miscommunication tropes 😂"
0,Definitely best Life Series kill by far. That was LEGENDARY.
0,"I love when etho gets put in situations where he has to lie it's always so fun to see how he reacts 😭
Like Scott caught the silence"
2,"Ladders, they went up, and most certainly came down."
0,I feel like I just witnessed Dark Etho and im scared now
0,The King of the Hill game was a fucking masterful idea. The only mistake was not setting up a timer so that they could all be present and accounted for when it happened.
0,"Martyn saying 'That's the greatest thing I've ever seen' RIGHT after the pillar finishes collapsing completely and there's a beat of silence is perfect comedic timing

Also if Etho wanted to know who was actually at the top at the time of collapse, he could have seen whose death message came up last (Skizz) since they would have had the longest to fall"
0,Could definitely heard Etho smiling in the hot tub scene.

0,"Grian never gets to be the Boogie man, but he gets to code himself as a society member.  😂"
0,"The discussion of who caused the tower to fall and that they'd find out when they uploaded the videos makes me want one or a small group of them to do some kind of trap that causes chaos, but no one shows who was behind it in the videos. Kinda like the mystery of the jingler. Maybe they reveal it right at the end of the season."

0,Did everyone keep their inventory?
0,No way. Ladders is back.
0,"They call him ladders:  They go up, and they come down...but they don't go back up again."
0,"My plan for the society would have been using the Dragon. 
Get the whole server in on the idea of slaying the dragon.
Bring a bunch of beds, get everyone to sleep on whatever beds they like. 
Mentally keep track of a few. 
Once everyone jumps in, one of US accidentally dies while the other two just stay alive while pretending to fight. 
The one who died wakes up, breaks all but a few beds and fills the room with lava. 
The few who used those beds will wake up and Burn! Hopfully, they'll put in chat after they die that they need someone to bring water. 
Then ANYONE can help them. 

Your plausible deniability is to put in chat, ""I'm at SPAWN??"" after you die the first time. 
When you break beds, most other people who die or succeed will also wake at spawn. 
Those who do fall prey will blame the last person who went in, Not the first person who died and two unknown helpers. And the achievement tracker will be their ""Evidence""


But for the plan you did, a secret network of tunnels connecting everyone's baces would have masked who was responsible."
0,This was a proper mad entertaining minecraft video cuz
0,Etho was sus on skizz there for a minute. The ohhhhhhh my gosh haha it clicked he wasn't being a duck lol
0,"I'm not sure you got away with it. Bdubs had the right idea, without even knowing it. The Society could have planted the idea in the cabin boys' heads and had them pull it off. It would still be your word against theirs, and if they deny it, you can present proof that they were involved. As they cannot prove you were involved, it would be a case of 'he said, she said.' However, the Willies have their reputation to fall back on, claiming it is Bdubs framing them to get back at you."

0,Improv club is my absolute favourite bit of this new series
2,"I've been going around watching everyone's perspective, it's glorious. The people on the ladder. The spectators watching UP the ladder. The rare spectator who got to see the whole fall. The knowing perp who was trying not to die of laughter below. And of course, poor Scar, who was stuck in the mines (which made it 1000% funnier, same energy as that one UHC where I believe you, Doc and Bdubs were in a team and two of you were on a pee break when the dragon was killed, leaving poor Bdubs to do a narration).

And I love how the multi-kill was a true team effort. Etho setting it up. Grian activating the trap. Gem reigning in the suspicion as the innocent witness. It was a work of art.

That, and I never expected King of the Ladder to turn into Among Us. That was so much fun <3"
1,Im so glad etho got to be part of this. I dont think anything would have beat his king of the ladders idea. He made this episode. This is shaping up to be one of my favourite life series
0,Ladders strikes once again.
1,"Best series, I could watch this every day!"
0,"Etho got Ladders on the Brain, what a “W”"
0,How did Cleo manage to lie her to the diamond block when she was the furthest from the top? 😆
0,"Talk about leading people down the garden path. 
I think the game has no way to end but the way it did. It went completely over everyone’s head. Hilarious."
1,So fucking good
0,"I was actually surprised when I found out via Grian in this episode that only he was hard-coded into the society. When I saw Grian's thumbnail and Etho's episode title after watching Scott's episode 1st this week I was like, smart of Grian to choose Gem and Etho for this - 'sgonna make it actually work! I'm almost sus on Grian about only himself being hard coded but an choosing, like Scott to Etho in a way, to believe Grian."
1,Bdubs' story in the first 2 minutes I such a wild thing to say on camera. You couldn't torture that out of me
0,"Hey etho, Is it possible to pm? I have an inquiry I would like to pass by you :)"
1,"A lot of shows these days tend to use nostalgia as a cheap excuse for unoriginality. But Etho? Disguising the ultimate Mindcrack callback as a hidden weapon with layers upon layers of social deception? He’s garnered the server’s trust by mentoring everyone about old Minecraft, only to plot the biggest kill in the life series with his signature flair—ladders and minigames. We’re truly reliving Etho’s past life, yet with the novelty and brilliance of the present. As someone who frequently rewatches the classics, this series is gold. Thank you for the memories. ♥︎"
0,I love Scar trying to pronounce serendipitous and Etho confidently correcting him to Scranpulous
0,The order of deaths would be the order of heights on the ladder pole. Made it very easy to rank them and cleo was one of the lowest lol
0,Etho has been such a menace this series lol!
0,46:30 amazing foreshadowing from jimmy
0,ETHO YOU AMAZING LMAO I laugh my heart out. Did not expect it to work that well.
0,"perhaps shart problems shouldn't be discussed in the problematically warm, hot tub water..."
0,34:00 BDubbs refers to etho as his wife.
1,"For this series my favourite to watch is Etho. He's so into the little things in every update.
I learn Minecraft trivia from this :)"
3,"""You hear one sound and all of a sudden you're pure panic, it's embarrassing"" I love bdubs so much lmaoo"
0,26:58 made me wheeze. just the tops of grians eyes looking out. it's so cute XD
0,"HA so I watched Scar first, and had no idea what this week's ""bit"" was! I love the different perspectives"
1,1:01:32 Are the tub boys in their revenge-cheating era?
12,"28:20 Screw the King of the Ladder thing, this was a well timed Ghast and I know need new underwear after Etho jumped around Gem."
1,everyone blaming etho
0,Sworn to secrecy
0,Definitely my fave pov this week 😂
1,"Of you're not gonna do custom thumbnails, at least select a frame where you're with your associates. =P"
0,This is seriously one of the best Life episodes ever! The chaos is next level xD
0,"there was a version, where you could get multiple types of protection on a single piece of armor. That would be cool to take advantage of :D"
0,I love that Etho finally got a big group kill and it was using king of the ladder of all things
0,Think it’s mad that so many of the older Minecraft players have no idea what king of the ladder is
0,No-one can ever call Etho washed up again after and idea and kill this epic.
0,Who needs to create a thumbnail when the perfect shot is in the episode?
0,"18:40 
Joel:  are you going to the fortress?
*awkward silence*
Joel: sure I'll come.."
0,“Grian’s like the lost sock that got stuck in the machine.”
2,Crazy that the episode opened with bdubs telling everyone he pooped his pants is wild.
0,"Dang, the way everyone got actually a little upset from that is wild lol. I guess knowing after the fact will make it better?"
5,Starting the episode with bdubs shitting his pants is wild
0,hell yeah
1,Why is nobody blaming Etho the infamous troll?
1,This is quite possibly the greatest episode of the Life Series ever.
1,Old combat is still superior
5,"Found Etho during hermitcraft S7. Watched a fair few old episodes, including the original King of the Ladders (which was fantastic!).

I can not imagine a better way this could have unfolded ... Absolutely brilliant idea and execution ... Added to my favourites and watched lots of viewpoints from others. 11/10."
0,Yes! Go team EGG! Etho you are forever the king of the ladder.
0,"I would love to see more Etho, Joel, Grian, and Gem doing stuff together and teaming up! The chemistry is so good, fun, and natural!"
0,"I came for the king of the ladder pov, but this guy is real villain

1:11:04 literally using abusive relationship tactics"
0,wouldn't the order they died in be the correct height order reversed?  Cleo lowest -> Skizz highest?
2,The soft voice crack on “definitely not 8 people” was so funny
0,Please build Etho's bottomless pit
20,Bdubs and Etho constantly arguing in life series will never be old
1,"king, you are so winning this"
0,etho saying he had 8 diamonds instead of 9 to account for the friendship one was sweet
0,"the hot tub crew is giving ""first time someone dates outside the established polycule"" vibes this episode and i'm here for it"
0,Unfortunately it’s not ginger
9,"Outside the ladders-based shenanigans, I fell that the conversation around the boats at 12:08 is hidden gem. The idea that the map makers/ devs came to a point where they had to move boats stuck in walls across minecraft versions to keep the bit going just because Etho didn't want to tell anyone how to get rid of them is hilarious. They got rid of a desert, but the boats had to stay. That's dedication"
6,"""He goes up... and you go down."" (eerie music)
LADDERS: COMING TO THEATERS THIS FALL"
1,51:03 cleo gets the block for being the only person not yelling 😂
0,"The Secret Society Prevails!

Rooting for your win Etho!!! Etho wins this time!"
0,Noticed after the thumbnail thing being pointed out last time. Everyone in this thumbnail died to the society.
3,"I did not think that I would be watching Ethoslab this long. I remember watching the ""king of the ladder"" episode of Mindcrack 13 years ago"
0,This episode was amazing!
0,amazing video etho!
0,Honestly the best episode of all the Life series ❤
0,"47:25 Cleo being top of the list is such karma as this legend gets written into the ancient tombs. Not washed up now! haha
... Also is this list reverse order for who made it to the top?
... Also also, love ya Cleo, but Etho ma boi"
0,YESSSSS ETHO DID KOTL
0,Glad she's feeling better but this episode would be even more hilarious if Gem still has the voice crack!
0,"1:12:22 that’s truly one of the noises of all time, you ok there buddy?"
4,"The menacing Ladders has come back, he can go up and he decides when everybody goes down."
19,"Etho showing us all our age when asking ""Do you know KotL?"""
9,I really hope Etho wins this one! It would make so much sense that the OG wins PASTLife!
25,Ladders. He goes up and everyone else goes down
4,"24:55 ""have any of you heard of King of the Ladder?""

So much nostalgia just hit me from that, and funnily enough that whole game idea was started by etho, guude, baj, and pause when they pranked guude's house back on mindcrack"
1,"This episode was pure cinema.  Love the King of the Ladders throwback, I feel old"
0,Let's Go Ladders
4,heyyyyy it’s duck life!
1,Etho is so much worse at lying than Gem and Grian 😭
0,"And that, my friends, is why they call Etho ladders"
0,petition for Etho to join the villeys!
2,"i love bdubs, but i was not expecting that story when i decided to watch an etho pov while i eat my lunch"
0,i can't wait for next episode to see everyone's reaction to the plot
0,It would be even better if Etho got a different person outside the society to host his game haha
0,we went from 6 lives > 2 to 8 lives > 6
0,Ladders...you go up...they go down
0,"That end… The family lives! 
Etho just left Cleo for Scott. It’s so clear now, and really funny. Unplanned perfection."
0,What a week for E to the T to your mom 😂
0,what update did the wither come out? :)
0,"I watched Cleo's video first and Gem was talking about a duck pond and I was very confused, All makes sense now"
0,"I hope someone makes fanart of that dodge at 28:19, etho and gem are 🐐"
1,This was the best kill since Bdubs' boogie in Last Life
3,"I love how Etho acts like just a goofy guy, but is secretly like the *smartest* person on the server (though Scott easily has the best street smarts and common sense). The way he was able to bait people with nostalgia, covertly participate then find an excuse to dip out, deflect blame away from himself and grian, and even build repertoire with Cleo without angering anyone else is absolutely genius."
0,ladders my goat
2,"""Take a chill pill"" we truly are back in beta now, boys."
2,eyyyy ladders!
1,I want this to be Ethos season so bad for the win!
224,"I love how NOBODY was suspicious at first that the pillar was made of sand, prebuilt on top of a platform, and there was no water pit below, even with players acting strange and an unexplained noise at the start of the episode. Etho's biggest advantage is that people have started to dangerously underestimate him."
1,Why are there no Etho pins on the merch store?
5,A master stroke of nostalgia from Etho at his prime
1,1:08:48 we're not even improv in!!!!
7,AND he gave his ex wife the diamonds. What a G.
2,"Of _course_ Etho's idea was to get the kills with ladders

They've all been Etho'd by Ladders himself!"
2,"Today I had to move out of my apartment and into a new one with no help. I told myself that once I was moved, I would allow myself to enjoy this. It is time."
98,"As someone on Gem’s video said,

E- Etho
G- Grain
G- Gem

And ducks come from Eggs"
1,This was my favorite episode of any Minecraft related content I’ve ever watched lol just incredible! You guys are true legends!

1,1:01:20 you did what?
0,why is no one talking about 1:12:19 lol
0,"This is the most iconic and memorable hermit moment in years imo, it being Ethos plan makes it even better too"
3,1:12:18 new etho sound just dropped
0,This honest to god might be the best episode in life series history. A literal movie here. Absolute cinema great work Etho this is going to live rent free in my head for months to come
0,"HE GOES UP, HE GOES DOWN"
4,"This episode is pure perfection. It's rare that a trap Etho sets up works in the Life Series, so this is not only a rare event but they even got 8 people!! Insane. Peak entertainment"
0,Hilarious episode! Amazing xD
0,"Sorry etho, i cant watch this in good faith, ive become a grown man, and the nostalgia wont kick in until im properly sober ;-; , promise i'll come back, its in another tab for me."
0,#caboneer
0,"This is such a clean, smart, cool, and amazing kill! I am so glad Etho managed to pull it off"
0,Do you remember King of the Ladder? Pepperidge Farm remembers...
4,When etho placed the ladders at 1:08:55 I thought he was going to improv “I go up I got down”
5,This is a top 5 Etho episode of all time. The callback to king of the ladder with the secret society plot... perfection <3
0,Etho 'Ladders' Slab on his villain arc
0,The King of the Ladders returns 🤯🤯🤯

0,"that's the thing about ladders, they go up and they go down"
0,Nostalgia kills… just didn’t expect it to be a legendary multi-kill lol
0,Beautiful
0,Wow what an episode ❤
1,this is the funniest smp video ive ever seen thank you
1,"The sign saying ""I know what you did"" while Etho is being given the 3rd degree by his team is hilarious!"
0,"@EthosLab you evil, freakin genius!!"
0,honestly still prefer this combat to newgen ;.;
4,"the amount of trust they (except Skizz) have in Etho is astounding. 
Etho asks them to go into a hole, they do it.
Etho asks them to climb a tower made of sand, they do it.
also Bdubs totally knew it was Etho all along. He can see through it all, and he still tried to play along to help him. What a friend.

very among us episode. 3 imposters and a bunch of crewmates. poor cabin boys got separated

I just realised this episode is over an hour long. it didn't even seem like that. xD"
2,"Etho's ladder grab/save falling off of the tower was perfect, and then the tower fell. Brilliant. :D"
3,"The saddest moment is when Smajor was asking Etho, and the defeated sound in Etho's tone was so miserable. A plus. That was peak comedy!"
0,The EGG Society
1,"I guess you guys made sure kill 2 ppl for each one of you and another extra 2 to be sure xD Cabin Boys better be bonding next session lol or Bdubs will go insane again.

I double tap w... why i cry jumping from opened trapdoors in parkour dojo _snorts_"
10,"The legendary square hole kills 5 people and solidifies its spot in Life Series history.

Etho’s ladders: hold my beer!"
1,That was top tier entertainment. Not just the trap but Al your interactions 😂
1,of course ladders came up with getting an octo-kill with ladders
2,He's too powerful in earlier versions!
2,"I love how they sort of have teams formed between teams
Like the secret society and improv class :3"
0,This episode is so good. Love the whole thing beginning to end.
0,"yknow I like to eat dinner while watching your videos, but i think that might have been a bad idea with this intro"
1,"Are we all gonna forget our boy man dude Etho slayed the ender dragon? He really is having all the fun without the Cabin pals. I love the Life Series so much, this is always great to watch."
0,1:14:00 and rohan will answer
6,17:40 etho casually robbing the villies
5,13:20 i think etho got the idea of king of the ladders from skizz trying to climb the stairs
9,"Normally it's so nice how Etho's so wholesome and honourable all the time, but it kind of backfires when he has to lie 😂"
12,“I gotta protect my boy Bdubs” what a ride or die friendship
0,This is trending in gaming!! Congratulations Etho! Sooo deserved!!
1,"I'm very happy you and Gem are in the same team, could not ask for the better team! The chemistry in between you two is so perfect!!"
10,"i like how etho tried to protect bdubs by telling him not to play the king of the ladder game, and then when he asks at 45:20 bdubs instantly goes ""I'M IN"" 😭"
0,28:21
3,the secret society was AMAZING and that octokill was the GREATEST MOMENT OF THE WHOLE LIFE SERIES OMGGG the conflict between the cabin boys broke my heart a little bit tho </3
1,I'm starting to wonder if the reason they call him ladders is because he goes up and down...
2,“Boy everyone is so roiled up today.” I love you Etho
1,"Fully random, but couldn't have picked a better trio."
0,I really want to see they play King of Ladder. It was so fun Back then
0,ten years in and etho still calls the dragon a he
0,oh we are so getting an etho win this season. that octokill was CRAZY and i am lowkey shaking???
0,I like how etho falls down so that he's safe from the whole trap and the etho of back then is so goated nice job society 😂
0,"Truly a thing of beauty, a work of art even."
1,Etho rushing Joel as he panics to finish the bridge 😂
1,If there's another king of the ladder the one at the top after a time limit should win I think.
0,Watching in 420p for that authentic iPod experience
0,"I want to point out that the only of Skizz's ""Good guys"" (see his video) who didn't die from the Task was Martin, and none of the Villies or Cabin Crew died."
0,goat

0,Ole ladder's at it again 🪜😂

0,"I watched bdubs' perspective first. The second I saw the ladder pillar was made of sand, I knew something was very, very wrong."
0,Bdubs got it spot on
0,anyone notice that anytime deaths happen etho is always looking away
46,The way BDubs just knows Etho and calls him out right away 55:25 58:30 1:01:30 just shows the level of friendship ❤
0,Awh man. I remember way back when Mindcrack was a big thing and king of the ladder was like the funniest thing you could find on YouTube. I used to watch VintageBeef and Etho and Iskall religiously back then. Im sure those videos don't hold up to this day but it was my lifeblood when i was like 12.
3,"Between this and Guude uploading new Minecraft episodes, this feels like 10 years ago.  The nostalgia is hitting hard!"
0,"oh man the knock back enchant was crazy in this version tho, you could get like lvl 9 couldnt you?"
0,The success of that kill truly all hinged on bdubs’ absolute faith in etho and all-in mentality on the ladder game 🥲
1,You definitely got caught  they knew it was you and grian and suspect gem
0,"Secret society was so good, even before the octokill"
0,the intros and outros are for some reason reminding me of the spongebob “futurrrreee” episode
0,Uncle Scott? oh no
18,"This is honestly the greatest video I have ever seen on YouTube!! The bickering between bdubs and etho was just perfect and the fact that etho thought of king of the hill! I just had a smile on my face for a whole hour thinking of mindcrack and the classic pranks and games that went on that server like the original king of hill, it just makes me want doc and beef to play along in the life series too. But 10/10 video makes me want to go back and watch all of ethos old content that I haven’t seen in like 11 years, like Painting prank on Nebris by TEAM CANADA!!🇨🇦"
2,Bdubs and Etho have a MOMENT after the pyramid situation and Cleo is the back just swiping wheat 🤣😂
0,do they not see eachothers videos? I imagine that they could know since all of their thumbnails show the secret society.  or even like fan made edits or animations
8,Listening to Etho trying to find a nonchalant way to say duck was hilarious 😂
0,"Hey Etho! If you read these, thanks for making videos. ❤"
0,Thanks bdubs for the mental picture... while I'm eating dinner. 😂 1:44
0,I think we should see more of Team EGG in the future. Not sure how though.
0,something about etho and grian (and gem too) teaming up always resulting in huge casualties
0,"Nobody thought it was weird for etho to come over with an ""old nostalgic game"" its on brand😂😂"
0,"""Do you know king of the ladders?""
thinking to myself, ""who doesn't?!"""
0,Wasn't familiar with Etho as Machiavelli XD
3,Etho and Bdubs. You do need to get a real King of the Ladder game going now. :) So they know what it really is. I cant believe folks had not heard of it before. :) Nostalgia. Edit-Just rewatched the old video. Beef was in on the first KOTL on the mushroom cloud prank so bring him in too! :) Old Farts Unite!
8,"you notice this is a lot of videos and its so funny from all the different POVs but etho saying everyone stand near the bed then directly moving away from the bed is the funniest thing ever, its not even subtle"
0,is 29:57 even a real word? I looked it up but I'm bad at spelling. Id love to seem smart by throwing that word around if it actually exists. 😂
1,serampulous
0,1:42 Get your snacks!
0,**M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-MONSTER KILLLLLLLLLL**
0,"Hey Etho. What a hectic episode but everyone had fun. You are so dead next week. Mushroom facts like I promised. There are certain trees that keep in contact with each other through mycelium in the ground. The world’s largest fungal body is in Oregon and is called the giant honey mushroom (Armillaria ostoyae) covers an estimated 2,384 acres. Also mushrooms like to grow next to wells due to the high amounts of moisture in the air. So I have heard. Thanks for working really hard to get out these wonderfully long episodes."
1,they call him ladders
0,30:01 I think you mean serendipitous?
0,5:41 this seems inappropriate to laugh about
0,Joel accidentally joining the secret society is so much funnier from this perspective.
0,I didn't think it was possible to beat Grian’s quad kill in limited life but an octo kill doubled the impressiveness 😂
19,"Etho uses the excuse that he doesn't want Scar to die to stop him from coming with him through the portal, only for Scar to be the only player still on 6 lives by the end of the session"
0,Now that everyone knows what happened next week will be crazy
0,A great way to determine who was at the top: who splatted on the ground last
1,Court of owls
0,"1:11:16 ...maybe ""a little bit""of jealousy.

Yeah, sure Bdubs, whatever you want to believe XD"
0,What a great play. Everyone fell for it.
1,Yooooo! Etho brought up his king of the ladders idea and it instantly took my back to a video of his like 8 years ago! It’s gotta be my favourite vid of his. Just hilarious!

0,ETHO!!!
0,You were standing around with COBBLESTONE IN YOUR HAND AFTER THE TOWER FELL AND NO ONE THOUGHT IT WAS YOU!?!? “I found the tunnel” and no one noticed the cobblestone?! I’m baffled 😂
0,I think it’s so cool that neither members of the society even played the game. A true whodunit. Well played guys.
0,Nice
3,"Bdubs “I was at the original!” 

My nostalgia is off the charts! And Guude is making videos again. This bas been a good couple weeks."
0,"At least this time, no accidental tag-along stepped off a strider into lava."
0,Time to go back to the original king of the ladders video! Then to sky shrooms i guess
0,1:14:22 Scott is the uncle that takes care of the kids in Cleo’s place since Etho is still an absent father even though it’s his turn to babysit them
0,And this is why Etho is Ladders
0,"I love the lawless land of Life Series... To be clear, I am specifically referring to you stealing iron boots from the Villies right in front of them while you're in the middle of a secret society with Grian and Gem. I know a lot else happened in this episode, but that got a good chuff out of me. Also cried laughing at you explaining to Skizz that you gave Cleo the diamond block ""out of justice"" when it sure looked like you did it out of bribery... gg, king."
1,cool
0,Love how Cleo got the diamond block but was the lowest on the tower since she died first lol
0,I really thought Etho did the multi kill until i rewatched it since i wasnt paying attention
0,"52:34 the funniest part about that is he did it underneath lmfao, maybe she will catch etho hiding it with the cobblestone"
144,"1:09:34 Everyone screaming and Etho just ""that was a fun class"" after plopping down a TNT"
1,"He goes up, and the rest of the server goes down!"
0,This game gonna be in Mcc now
1,i would've been asking around if anyone else remembered when there was confusion about if chickens were called chickens or ducks. i cant remember when or how that happened but i think i remember legacy edition even having splash text referencing it
0,this episode was amazing
1,"This was the best executed plan, with the highest kill count, in the entire Life series. Etho ftw"

1,That was insane. The octokill will go down in history
1,"I'm not surprised that Etho, Gem and Grian can achieve 8 kills. They are a competent team. If the secret society had been, say, Scar, Bdubs, Jimmy and Skizz, then I'd be surprised if they got more kills than deaths in the pursuit of the goal. Team inept. But it would have been great content for all the opposite reasons."

23,"Guys listen to this. Everyone’s partner in double life right? Grian one 3rd Life, then Scar one Secret Life. Scott won Last Life, and Pearl won Double Life. Joel won Wild Life, so WHAT IF Etho now wins Past Life?? (Also don’t think this FULLY counts because of the standalone series, but Martyn won Limited Life and Cleo won Real Life). Honestly super interesting to think about."

I love the Secret Society’s dynamic lol, absolutely glorious! 😂 I said it from the start of the season that I think either Etho or Gem is going to arise victorious in the end. Chances are looking better than ever! 💪 Etho’s plan couldn’t have gone better, he is cooking literal flames. AMAZING episode I loved every second of it!"

1882,"The ladders kill was just beyond cinematic. Everything lined up for it to be the perfect whodunit setup:

>> A small collection of ""witnesses"" are present. Each close enough to have been the killer and who's stories don't align 100%

>> Everyone just happens to be zoomed in looking at the top of the tower at the time of the deed.

>> One of the most likely culprits, Scar, is mysteriously missing. 

>> Bdubs, the jealous lover, gets caught up in the mix and immediately picks up the scent of the truth.

>> Martin, a yellow name, is innocent but the only one with the legal means to do the act.

>> Etho, The corrupt gamemaster, is in on the plan but was fiddling with the inventory and eating food at the time of the crime.

>> Gem, Another corrupt witness seemingly totally impartial, gets vouched for by an innocent.

>> Pearl, the innocent witness, gets cast into suspicion when the tunnel at the scene leads to her base."

146,59:30 etho being sneaky funny. he just claimed he had no cobble because he hasn't had time to mine yet but shortly after says that's a lot of cobble at a wall that someone on his team made and then swapping to cobble and trying to show it to everyone and then doing more effort in showing by placing it down xD

0,"I think Etho might have doomed the Secret Society, and they are gonna lose those 2 life. He kept saying he had a secret he couldn't share about his involement with the ladder deaths. And everyone is pretty much exclusively suspicious of Grian, Gem and Pearl. I guess what might save them is that they also think it is Pearl because of the Evil thing. What an insane moment in the series though, wow."

5,"It's a little sad you didn't get to save this for a boogie kill, but it was still fantastik!"
13,During that whole ladder thing I am surprised nobody in the society came up with the idea to do it remotely. Add a piston and have someone activate it from a distance or put a tnt at the base and it blows up the base of the ladder. Maybe I was missing something with the rules where they had to directly cause the accident and not let a redstone signal do it?

8,"Since I watched Scar’s first I was wondering what went down when all those names start popping out of nowhere and now I can officially say the was the biggest multi kill and probably top ten in all of Life Series in regards to moments and kills 

Also Etho wth Scar was an innocent man going insane in the mines and your teammate for god sake and you immediately turned on him along with Grian

Well played tho! Success I’d say for the most part beside the fact next session Etho, Gem and Grain are going to be hunted"

1,"'Grian' the best traper, 'etho'  with the lader idea,and gem making a trap together who  have the best master minds ever! , surely the trap is going to get a octople kill! This is going down In the history books guys!🎉"
0,I love how all the teammates of the secret society members did not participate or just wasn’t there for the king of the ladder game
2,"""What's the right word when, you know, something happens and it works out really well?"" ""Serampulous."" ""Serabulous! Yeah!"" 😆
Even funnier because Scar almost had it right before Etho threw him off"
0,"I wonder, is the boat in the wall bug the same as the team canada boats in Zisteau's base?"
72,"This is definitly one of my all time fav life series episodes! between having to find the other 2 ducks, the king of the ladder game and trying to deflect! its also fun how the last time etho and grian got paired up toghether for a ""task"" they caused the wither/warden fight during secret life and all the chaos that lead to"
1270,Etho can't smoothly spin in circles in the hot tub because there isn't enough room between his keyboard and the edge of his desk! 😂 I hope it's doing good for your tendons!
42,"I'm not an OG in this channel and I didn't know etho in his GOAT days but I can see now why he's  been given this title 😭❤
That was so brilliantly executed.
I'd LOVE to see etho win this season"
69,"Gem & Etho need their own evo world just for PVP. No more missed versions! 

I’d watch any iteration of that. A stream, a series, just them or a full  bracket of friends with different divisions, Gem and Etho’s Canadian PVP school, anything."
1,"Instructions unclear, took out 1/2 the server."
2,"People will talk about ""the great fall of Episode 3"" for generations"

0,I started Minecraft 1.1 😊
1,THE OCTOKILL IS INSANE!
0,I am soooo glad I waited to watch this first
156,"29:55 Serampulous?! Etho, you knew Scar meant serendipitous 😂"
22,"Seeing this after watching Scar's episode first gave me so much more context, I also realized how good of a team Gem, Grian and Etho are"
6,8:27 THE DUCK!
137,"Etho is in like ALL of the lifers thumbnails and as an Ethogirl, I’m SCREAMING IN ETHO CONTENT"
18,"I was literally questioning on what was happening when I was watching Joel’s video and now just watching Etho’s video, every question I had was explained
It was amazing and glad Etho didn’t die to the game. (Sadly Joel did.lol)

ABSOLUTE CINEMA

0,Literally hand over my mouth shocked and amazed at that kill
1,So does bdubs' call out mean they still lose their lives?
1001,"i didn't even realize, but Etho took the the dragon kill this season (38:12)"
0,Should have trapped spawn. Then destroyed and replaced beds while people were killing the dragon.
0,Absolute cinema
0,Joel bridging over a giant lava lake while they need to kill 2 players and they don’t think to break a block lol😂
3,10:59 god i love this man😂😭😭😭
1,Dubs w/ the shart!
7,Is Etho the one who got the final shot on the dragon?? ( 38:15 )
7,"watched BDubs video first and after watching Etho perspective next, the king of the ladder moment is COMPLETE CINEMA and what an evil genius plan"
6,Etho living up to the Ladders nickname I see!
13,"I think using some tnt to take out the ladder would've been a better play. It would've still broken all the ladders, and it could be explained by a creeper going off. But oh man, was that still funny to watch."
67,"I did not believe anybody would willingly climb a sand pillar ladder
Egg on my face witnessing an OCTOkill"
3,What a nostalgia trip
11,"If Grian had remote activated TNT to blow the bottom of the pillar up rather than breaking it normally, you could've claimed a creeper went off"
2,"honestly, the boogeyman thing should be in every single life episode and every season! i just love the game with this!!! every other ""special effects"" should just be added on top of the boodeyman :p"
3487,"30:01

1,That was the greatest multi-kill 🤣
29,"That ""King of the Ladders"" idea was pure genius, no one had a clue what was going to happen to them! 😂"
1,serampulous
256,"I love how the secret society is just the villains but they swapped out Pearl with Etho, somehow it feels like it went from Team Rocket in the anime to Team Rocket in the games.
Which may not sound like it's a big difference, but I'm comparing a trio of goofy comic relief villains to the pokemon equivalent to the mafia.

Does this make Etho Giovanni? His allegiance with a completely different team could be an equivalent to Giovanni being a gym leader..."
187,12:20 etho casually hits every shot
2,1:44 We Listen and we dont judge 😭🙏🙏
109,watching skizz try to climb the ladder at 13:24 had me cracking up
0,Wow we have been blessed with a 1h and 14 min episode!!
520,"Etho, I've been watching your videos ever sense I was a kid! Its crazy to think that from then to now I have turned 87 years old, have had 38 children, graduated from college 13 times, and started driving a unicycle. I will still watch each one of your videos!"
5,"Wow, king of the ladder takes me back. So many laughs!"
40,"38:13 my boi etho got the last hit, killing the dragon"
0,Afraid to fart syndrome
0,Absolute CARNAGE hahaha
3879,Seeing Etho's Pillar of Doom kill so many people compared to the Villy's Square Hole accidents is like watching Giovanni in action after getting used to Team Rocket's much more tame shenanigans.

0,Am I tripping or do I hear mumbos voice when tango was talking?
0,"Don't they know that the way the door closes depends on what direction they placed it as? Like, if you just placed it, that's the door being closed and the redstone or pressure plate opens it. How I do the old door trap is place them like how they would look when they're open so once the pressure plate activates, it'll close all the doors. I'm sure they've probably figured it out and I'm just being stupid but that's what I do..."

0,This episodes weather reminds me of the mindcrack server.
0,"Etho nevering seeing Ghibli movies is a fucking travesty; please please please do yourself a favor and watching some Studio Ghiblo films. Highly recommends Princess Mononoke, Pom Poke, Naussica Valley of the Wind."
0,"Oh, the lore of Boogeyman Etho. Even when its him, its not him."

0,ren is now guude 2.0
0,Since I started watching this 10 years ago Etho videos are suggested
0,Hahaha the lighthouse scene. The whole bit of John not understanding the hint and then their explanation to grian😂😂😂
0,28:00😮 30:18 WITCH!
0,It's unfortunate but in beta 1.6 they fixed minecarts next to each other causing extreme velocities. So the old booster rail systems didn't go as fast and players stopped using them :(
0,12:40 I remember Etho doing that to Guude’s house in Mindcrack but on the glass
0,Etho I want to see more of your playing in Beta.
0,The same intro you've always had and then its beta 1.7.3 ❤
0,"I'm with Gem, I think Etho likes redstone"
0,love you etho
0,"I got really confused because I must've accidently turned loop on, so after they spun out, they spun back in and I thought maybe etho was giving a sneak peak to the next episode or something. My confusion quickly turned into deja vu and then realization."
0,i need to study etho like a bug because what do you mean you can reference circle in the square hole but you don't know what studio ghibli is? truly baffling
0,Why does BDub's legs look like it's actually a head with a mask on?
0,Why does tango sound different?
0,"31:56 Scott just having a hard time with what Bdubs says, and you 3 ignore it. Scott's biggest thing in the life series is trust lol. He will trust you 3 and your allies until the very end. It's how things have always worked for him"
0,"35:20 scuse me Etho, AAAARGH!!!"
0,If you collect beef in these beta versions...is it VintageBeef?
0,Etho's lack of anime knowledge when he's had Kakashi as his skin all these years is hilarious 😂 I'm not a huge anime fan myself but I love Ghibli movies and Naruto 🤓
0,Scar probably cleared out more boats from the Rejects base than anyone else 🤷🤡💀
0,Watch Castle in the Sky.  I think Mark Hamill is the voice?
0,Etho thank you for continuing youtube since i was kid
0,3:33 team name: the big burley man and Scott 😂
0,31:17 best sleep films ever
0,Etho nor Bdubs being a boogey was a wasted moment because the second Grian took them to the spot it wouldve been a great “I AM DA BOOGEY” callback.
0,i guess we don't get to see a remake of the EATS superboatway.
0,When he threatened to place the tnt on top of Joel in the hole my mind immediately went to “pause and beef… best of friends”
0,the redstone -> obsidian trick actually works until way later like 1.2 or 1.3 still :P surprised not more of em knew about it.

2,16:17 it took him soo long lol
0,“I saw some anime’s” etho says while wearing a kakashi skin from Naruto ( inspired from @jusjr_1122 )
0,"Ha! One of my sisters introduced another sister to the ""square hole"" video just yesterday. 😆"
2,Life is good when Etho is posting
0,I remember that moving glitch. Guude had to deal with it a lot. It has something to do with hitting a button while opening your inventory causes your player character to continue the action repeatedly. I think Guude kept getting stuck walking sideways or something.
0,"Hey Etho, where is your Life Series enamel pin?"
2,"@35:20 ""Uh, excuse me Etho- AHAHAHAAHAHA"""
0,THE TIMING WITH THE RECORD! ETHO! YOU BRING FORTH THE BOOGIEMAN 57:30

0,The amount I smile during these videos. Love this series so far.
1,"Etho, I've been watching you for 14 years on and off as I go through phases of Minecraft and other games, and recently I’ve gotten back into it! During this time, I’ve gone through elementary school, junior high, high school, and college, got married, started a career, and am now expecting a child. I have a long commute to work, so I’ve been listening to the Let's Play series to pass the time. There are many other Minecraft YouTubers to watch, but there is something unique about your style that has kept me coming back. It's heartwarming, and I genuinely hope you are doing well. Thank you for the years of entertainment. Cheers!"
0,What's wrong with choosing a still from the video for the thumbnail?
48,Was not expecting the reference at 43:10 lol!! I kinda forgot Etho actually exists on the internet and isnt just block man
0,"22:47 god dang it Etho, I literally spilled my drink xD"
0,"Regarding thumbnails - I don't even look at them. Never have. YouTube thumbnails are like an Asian high street, where there's so many bright shapes and colours overwhelming your visual senses, and sometimes it works the opposite to how you intend. The exception being KatherineElizabeth, Tango, and Zedaph who have started putting coloured borders around their thumbnails which helps them stand out from the crowd. I personally only look at usernames and video titles, searching for content that catches my eye. Thumbnails don't influence my decision to watch a video as much as an eye-catching ""headline"" title."
0,cool
3,I love how the cabin boys have been making allies with literally everyone except the rejects
0,You could have built a obsidian base that couldn't be griefed with that Redstone hack
0,47:31 In before Etho goes back to watch his old Eats-road videos
1,"The karma after killing members of The Family is great (killing Gem in Wild Life, Etho dies right after; killing Joel this episode, Etho dies shortly after).

0,"Stands next to tnt. Explodes. ""What’s up with that range?"" 😂😂"
1,(spoilers) I love how technically Scar’s boogie was cured when Etho was blown up and they just kept on trying to kill The Rejects lmao

0,I love how nostalgic this all is!

0,The older etho gets the more Canadian I can hear in him 🇨🇦❤️
0,"Etho saw ~some~ anime.  Certainly Naruto. 😅


I love the lighthouse boat gag. 🤣"
0,Watching this in 720p without the 60fps really brings back the nostalgic Etho feel.
0,why the girl lowkey sound like joe swansons wife
1,Etho with his Make-a-wish foundation gifts for sick children
0,I just hope we get to hear your opinion on spirited away eventually. It’s one of my favorite movies!
0,Reminiscing bout the Past it truly feels full circle. all of y'all had made a life for urself's off of this game and its amazing to see 15 years later the community still here.
2,"Etho is a menace this episode, and I love every minute of it!"
2,"Etho- I say this with love- the boat prank is one of the most wholesome and dorkiest things I've ever seen in Minecraft/Hermitcraft, and I have not laughed so hard in ages 😂😂😂❤ Thank you! It's truly up there with the grey glass.  I love it so much, and if I had been playing Minecraft at that time, that would totally have been me, putting boats in people's walls and giggling like crazy 😂❤

Also, I can see where it is kind of funny that you haven't heard of the Ghibli movies when your skin is the best character in all of Naruto, which is one of the most popular anime ever; however, as someone not from Japan, I also totally get how you could be familiar with Naruto and not Ghibli. I got my first exposure to anime *shows* from Adult Swim and streaming sites, while I got my first exposure to Ghibli *movies* from renting them where I worked at Blockbuster. There are definitely popular Japanese shows, movies, whole genres even that don't necessarily cross paths. But I would recommend the Ghibli movies in general though, the art and music are beautiful and they're usually pretty wholesome and pleasant experiences. Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Howl's Moving Castle are some of my top recommendations 😊"
0,new Etho Slab video💚
0,ETHO!!!
0,35:21 perfect Skizz Scream. almost identical to the one that plays in Tango’s factory on Hermitcraft. :D
0,Well.. This is my last etho episode.. Doesn't know who ghibli is..
1,Fairly certain that 4 people in a 1x1 hole in 2025 would have the same problem lmao
0,Etho has gone 38 years without seeing a Studio Ghibli movie... poor poor man.
0,everything goes in the square hole
0,"I even remember the playing the game at 10 FPS [oh wait, that's just my YouTube being stupid, you would think my only 5-year-old phone would still be able to play video at two time speed. And yes I am self-reporting and the watch time is still better than no watch time at all...]
3:02 well I mean I do know how to do it but you don't have to shout my name... 
4:35 No, they removed that feature. Shall we say after they added power rails. If this is beta 1.6 then it should still be in the game
9:15 no that's this interacting. Weird with the water, I'm pretty sure the two spacing ladder thing wasn't fixed until like release 1.3... though also I don't know if there's a mod adding it back or if it was actually 1.8. but it is a thing in Greg tech New horizons which is in 1.7.10
42:36 Yeah good thing"" tango"" had some water on him.
43:45 gem still sounds like Jennifer Lawrence and it's still super cute
54:39 The sand block fell into the TNT clock and blocked all the damage that is literally how that works to this day."

I also hope he goes on to win this."
2,"51:59 yeah, Episode 1 is reccomended to me occasionally"

1,Nobody notice you choosing frames for your thumbnails? I thought that was commom sense.

0,I KNEW IT about the thumbnails !! this video had me laughing sm at times honestly
0,You were mentioned on Mr beast gaming 3 months ago
0,"21:14 ""You should fill someone's base with fences..."" Such a diabolical reference, and noone picked it up? ... o.O ,,,"
0,50:30 I thought everyone knew that is what Etho did?
0,Seeing all those boats stuck in the walls is making me unreasonably annoyed.  Good job.
2,"I'd figured out you chose the thumbnails a while back, but had no idea it dated back the the UHC days."
0,Go watch castle in the sky by Studio Ghibli
0,Didn't you talk about picking custom thumbnails a few years ago?

0,How has bdubs fallen down? His thumbnails are the best
0,A lot of tech Minecraft during this era was mob farms and mob filtering so it's hard to showcase in a short format.
0,"""i saw some animes"" says my favorite kakashi cosplayer"
1,"A massive Ghibli fan here,  ""Spirited Away"" is my 2nd fave (you should check that) but for me the best was ""Princess Mononoke"" I highly recommend it."

1,Does everyone else see Bdubs nose as being his mouth? I can't unsee it
0,Thumbnail bombshell!
1,Etho is more villain than the villain 😅😂😂
16,"The Square Hole joke had me laughing so hard, I love that one too and every time Grian was calling it ""The Square Hole"" it was all I could think of"
0,sometimes it feels like bdubs and scar can play up their air-headedness for laughs but I love the how truly childish bdubs is at 10:57. Lighting a little patch of carpet on fire and immediately putting it out because he “just wanted to show scar” is such an authentically naive decision an older brother whose a bad influence would make to impress their little sibling.
1,Thanks for sharing 👍👍✌️
0,this time highkey victim playing LOLOL especially with the rejects😂😂
1,43:27 SQUARE HOLE MENTION!
0,"I don't think you're washed, I think you're forgetting that the singleplayer game and the multiplayer game were separate under the hood until Full Release 1.3, so a bunch of things worked in singleplayer but not in multiplayer"

0,"I knew I recognised the seed!!!
Took users a long time to find it, there’s a really great YT doc on it."
1,This whole time I thought you could still turn redstone into obsidian like that... I never tried it to realise it was patched out
1,I recall Beef and Pause getting trapped in a 1x2 hole in one of Team Canada series.
0,7:38 I see some of Etho's ancient wisdom has expired lol
0,"""thats ten years ago!"" lil more than buddy ol pal"
0,"I don't think Etho was joking around about Studio Ghibli, but if he was, he could not have done better. xD :D"
0,When you see Tango move around like Mambo 🤣
0,"I knew about the redstone obsidian mechanic, but I never understood how it worked. Didn't know it was just a cobble generator with redstone."

0,The most sus on the server.
1,"Hey etho with grounded 2 coming out soon I think you should give the first one a try, you don’t even have to make a video about it I just think you’d like the game. It’s kinda reminiscent of ark which I remember you playing a couple times many years ago, and it’s co-op too in case you wanted to play with a buddy"
2,"gems voice like that is so cutesy, I can't handle it 😂"
0,"the updates skipped ahead wayyyy too quickly, I get that alpha can be slow but there were so many things they didn't have the opportunity to try"
0,"35:50 Ok, fess it up. Who here put sugar in Etho's water? Look at him. He has more energy in old MC than everyone around! I'm starting to rethink these washed up accusations, there might be a truth to it. New MC is nerfing him up."
2,"3:34 etho doing the same thing with the rails 3 times had me dying, I didn’t even hear what the other two where saying I was so invested in the rails"

2,"Etho's pathetic spins at the end are because of his mouse setup, can't do long strokes! 🤣"
0,"I think what I love most about the beta episodes is getting to see Etho with all these years of experience and confidence going back to his original let’s plays episodes, where he was so nervous and shy. I think Past Etho would be so proud of Present Etho."
0,Honestly your thumbnails are peak. I've been intrigued by them for years now.
0,29:43 you can tell that etho was gonna let the creeper kill pearl
0,Where does the extended piston go? Yeah... in the square hole.
1,could scar not have called his accidental kill on etho his boogie? then bdubs wouldn’t have died
0,"Etho, my man. Next episode, notch apples for days"
0,Ethos interaction with gem and pearl is just a little off idk why
0,I always just assumed that the thumbnail screenshot was chosen deliberately
0,"Odd, I distinctly remember Etho talking about the thumbnail thing before and how he just selects an image from an image in the duration of the video."
0,I thought everybody knew that was how Etho made his thumbnails
0,54:14 Hahaha noice
0,"I thought he said ""Total Raw"" like it was some kind of clan which made sense because it looked like he has an egg with a face on his hoodie."
0,That evil laugh after killing Joel 😂

0,"A Collab video with mumbo would be cool, you seem to have a lot of crazy Minecraft knowledge"
0,"Etho you gotta get people with the old ""shift over a hole but the sides are chests so you just fall in"" trick PLEASE it would be such a throwback. I dont remember the exact version it works in, but basically in one version they shrunk the chests and when you shift over it you just fall. I recall you setup a hilarious trap with it on the old mindcrack server!"
0,Hot Tub Time Machine is definitely not what I expected to remember
0,"How do they mean food doesn't come in into much later, they're in Beta 1.7, and hunger is introduced in Beta 1.8. :P"
1,I can't believe that Etho hasn't seen any ghibili films
1,Didn't understand the reverse boogie thing. Can someone explain? I don't know why Etho could kill Joel
1,"I didn't know or remember any of those funny bugs and glitches! I feel like I have missed very important and funny era of Minecraft!
By the way, many years ago you said something like that you spent a lot of time in your cactus farm only listening the sound of cactus falling into water 😊"
0,"Since I also recognized the shape sorting video reference Etho made, I must also be hip! 

(Age 32)"
85,"9:41 ""water bucket drop? *misses* ""... it doesn't work, for some reason"" Ha!"

2,33:25 that was actually a glitch in the version if you jump an enter you inventory at the same time
0,I was really glad to see these session 2 uploads on my birthday there's so many funny moments this episode where it's so pathetic it's funny lmao
0,Eatsroad mentioned!
0,😂😂😂
0,Im real disappointed there was no mention of etho using the boat trick on guude's house. Bdubs should have remembered that but he wasnt involved if memory serves.
0,"I'm pretty sure that redstone-obsidian interaction made its way into 1.0 as well, I remember I used it a lot."
0,The cobblestone! Cant' believe they didn't catch that the first second.

0,So the kleenex box saw this version the first time around no?
1,"I think this is beta 1.7, probably one of my favorite versions becuase of how simple and slow paced it is. It was right before the Adventue update. I also like the world gen"
0,Someone's gotta do the shifting off the edge of a chest trick when we get to those versions
0,"I'm loving these episodes, the whole nostalgia thing is *fantastic*"
0,i love etho life series videos they truly are their own thing..
3,57:23 the fact that there was a death while playing the “boogyman record” is INSANE

0,is this 2013?
0,"I remember being so excited when they introduced flint and steel, I spammed it so much that it burned down a skyscraper i built to the build limit"
0,I like how Bdubs got murdered twice and he just didn't care
0,"Now i wanna see etho and gem team up on the next life series. Cottage core and cabin core collab.

And of course Bdubs will be there too cuz its inevitable xD"
117,50:14 etho knowing that the chests are burning and choosing not to do anything is so hilarious to me
1,Etho could end world hunger and he would still be thanked with some redstone🤣
4,"9:22 there is still a way in beta 1.7.3 to glitch tnt to be punch able again. Rather than needing flint and steel. Infact there are a lot of new glitches and bugs that have been found in this version. Though I fear as a group you may have moved on already

29:36 there is also a way to get torches on the side of TNT

32:59 this actually is a glitch where if you open your inventory almost instantly after performing an action, You will be stuck doing that action until you open your inventory again or press the same action again."
3,"50:17. I remember one of his old UHC episodes where the thumbnail was a creeper seconds away from blowing up in his face.

Nothing even close to that happened in the video. The guarantee is a lie, and I love it."
1,A very fun episode
2,"Ah yes, the inverted doors

Used to have to build an entire circuit with a torch to keep one powered until the plate was pressed, and also ensure it was usable by both sides in case it were an iron door or just for convenience"
0,This video was absolutely hilarious!
0,Major etho lore drop in the end of the episode was unexpected
0,"The whole series should take place in Beta. When everyone is red, you'll be in modern versions, and I want to see Beta PVP shenanigans!"
243,31:55 Scott’s disappointed sigh when everyone else realized to trust is their strongest tool in the life series. It’s EVERYTHING to me. He sounds like a stressed out parent
1,"""Remember this"" Etho I have 100 hours in the past few months in this version, I definitely remember"
0,I hope when they get to the version before they fixed the item stacking where if you pick up a bunch of items at once you hear a cool spammed noise for every item picked up.
0,"After all these years, still no thumbnails"
0,I KNEW you had to be picking frames for your thumbnails!!!!!!
0,OMG! More etholore! He makes his thumbnails!

0,I love that lol what are you doing you crazy physco 😂
5,Etho turning turning around to the square hole not once but twice was hilarious
0,"I'm surprised they didn't settle on ""Lumberjacks"" as their team name."
1,49:19 Just the other day Impulse was talking about how you don't make thumbnails lol (It was on the podcast episode with BigB)
11,Biggest surprise of the season thus far is Etho knowing the square hole TikTok. Truly a hip and cool dude 😎
0,That was purely awesome.
6,Bread was the best food for exploring. A few stacks of wheat + a crafting table meant much more healing per inventory space. If you were pottering around your base then meat was better as you could just restock after healing.
1,"i can't remember when, i think somewhere within 1.5.7 there was a transmutation thing where you could use string instead of redstone, this was a hack that skyblockers used to make obsidian"
0,32:01 this is why I have trust issues
0,Yo! Recognized it a minute in! Beta 1.7.3! My absolute FAVORITE version on the game! 😃
0,48:53 for some reason this made me think of season 7 of hermitcraft when mumbo made a timelapse saying tiny tiny tiny tiny timelapse
2,I love the return of old school griefer Etho! Haha it’s what got him into MC originally 😂
0,"I hope Tango feels better his voice sounded a bit different, maybe he should get some cough drops or something"
1,The yeet road and the creeper/mob doors and transports is what I remember watching when I started looking up your videos. 😊
0,50:05 Bdubs jumpscare holy
0,They skipped way too many versions!
0,Etho.. im omw to Canada and im going to lock you in a smol room and make you watch studio Ghibli movies. Its blasphemous that you haven't. You must repent!
0,this was a fun episode
0,Ts so peak and funny
0,"I thought it was obvious that Etho did thumbnails - the thumbnail is always pretty relevant to the theme of the video. I won't lie, I didn't notice the contrast and brightness adjustments though."

6,"Wow, *real* Mount Rushmore - they put their face on a mountain sacred to the people who were originally here"

0,MumboTek and TangoJumbo
4,1:40 them all trying to avoid saying “why is it so big” 😂
1,"One idea for a trap is to just put blocks in front of both sides of a nether portal exit, for a long time you couldnt break blocks if you were in the portal frame so you could easily get someone that way
Edit: I should have watched the video first LOL"
0,I knew it! I had my suspicions about the seed last episode!
0,Etho legacy series...
180,Giving Etho redstone in this series must be like giving your artist nephew a pack of colored pencils for Christmas.

0,😊😂
1,This season is SO MUCH FUN!
0,This just reminds me of chocolate island with the boats. You should do an island tour of that again.
6,In old minecraft Etho is a Battle Wizard. Performing magic and defeating everyone in sword combat. It's hilarious and awesome.
0,"Hey etho, you may want to craft some wooden slabs to see them get removed over time"
0,38:57 My man is stealing stuff in broad daylight
0,8:05 himedanshi etho confirmed 😭
0,52:00 this whole trip down memory lane was so sweet
0,"I think you could dupe sand by zero ticking at this point too, yeah?"
0,"Oh yeah, I made a guide on that Obsidian gen. lol"
0,Ghibli movies are extremely depressing in like a bad and unpleasant way and I don't know why so many normal people who don't like anime like them. I haven't even seen many. I don't want to see more. Why do people have so much love for something that is laced with such sickness though?
0,Etho is always his own worst enemy in these series'
0,"39:31 not telling them you only were missing one heart was one of the most disgusting, dastardly moral lacking scumbag moves. You should teach the ""Villys"" your method of heartlessness. Team Rocket could really use it. They've got a hole. That's their evil."
0,"Everyone giving Etho redstone in these old versions is taking me back to when guys used to give girls graphic cards and it was like, nerd flowers."
0,35:00
0,"@12:13 lmao ""I like science"""
0,you forgot to do pvp this session eith gem
3,"32:23 

…

Every single boat boys fan simultaneously just fainted

34:11 when i tell you i paused the video and looked up at the sky in disbelief for like a minute and a half"
1,"@12:12 bdubs has such a genuine reaction, I loved it. His ""It's time for Redstone with b(dragged out) OOOO.. "" segments have bloomed genius haha"
4,"I've watched a few POVs before this one came out, and every time I'm shocked that The Rejects went straight into the nether in front of their 'enemies' (even inviting them to stay around and fix the boats), and didn't even intentionally come back out from a different portal 😂This series is great!"
3,Etho left the villains for a second and they built the simplest pitfall trap into the one pitfall trap to kill the most Lifers in all the series
18,"57:52 Tango accidentally dying and appearing in his own base, having to explain himself and then the genuine confusion of ‘why is everyone here?’"
0,18:32  I dont think that rlly allowed cuz Joel had already killed Scott and killing him for killing Scott goes against the no green on green unless ur the boogie. Defending ur teammate is one thing but revenge is another
0,I remember Doc and Anders getting stuck in the hole.
0,"If you go look at the original series, the first episode has like, doubled in views in the last week"
0,Unhinged Etho is the best unhinged and the best Etho
0,this season is going to be YOUR season i can feel it !!!
0,the minecart mechanics are so nostalgic
0,"idr what update it was, but if swamps get added in, remember the diamond trick! + 14 blocks Y off clay, dig down, get diamonds ez"
0,"Hey Etho.
It is fun watching you enjoy the older versions of Minecraft. The obsidian Redstone trick is cool. I totally forgot you can get mushrooms in the Nether. Are pots in the game yet? If so, can you put mushrooms in them and if not I wonder when that started. Mushrooms are cool, just in case you weren’t aware. 😊 Maybe look into slime mold. They aren’t a plant or an animal but can work together to create the new generation of slime molds."
3,Been watching Naruto recently. Feels like BDubs is the Might Guy to Etho's Kakashi
0,"No shot, I just checked on my phone while watching this and I got recommended Etho's boat dispenser video"
0,Just remember to put boats in the minecarts
0,I love how everyone uses their old skin while etho is just there with his normal skin cause he never actually changed it
3,I love how Tango cut out so much of the thumbnail conversation like it was some big secret in his perspective
0,"Great video, love the concept :]"
0,7:10 Oh my god. The flashbacks right here. This is the I am the boogey crew 😭 it was just like this T-T
6,"5:42 the bromance is strong with these two 💀

10:57 made me cackle, i’ve never heard Etho’s voice reach that octave xD Anyone kinda think he sounds like Prince Zuko from ATLA, or am i delusional"
0,1:20 herobrine fog
0,Is that sweat I smell?
0,"Everyone’s currency: Diamonds
Etho’s currency: REDSTONE!"
10,"49:00 Oh, we know, and that's the best kept secret of an Etho fan. 

Also, I've been absolutely loving this series so far; it's been so much fun going down memory lane with old MC and seeing you and the other veteran players show off all the fun stuff that was once possible."
1,"I'm glad you tried to make a EATS road, it was nice to see it again.
I do remember that the boat loader was really difficult to get just right, but I'm fairly sure it should have been possible, maybe not on a server though?

I seem to remember the EATS road didn't really die until squid were introduced, because you couldn't guarantee a free path. 
The road still worked though, it just wasn't reliable because it ended in bonking."
0,"Oh, wait, they’re referencing the Hot Tub Time Machine."
0,"i noticed the seed in the first episode, i thought all the hermit knew about it"
0,"is that ""Tango-Jumbo"""
4,"""What goes in the square hole?"" Lol Tired Actor on TikTok will be happy to hear she's still getting references for that"
0,I like how careless they all are with their tilled soil.
1,"""Missy!? You're pulling out the Canadian?"" Love Gem"
0,Etho is reliving the times before he became washed up
0,Mumbo being on BMD payroll while Etho using Resolve for stills is untapped potential
0,"I like how in the first version they were all concerned about keeping things looking pretty or cool, but by now they’ve started just putting together random blocks or blowing things up."
0,How do we keep track of how many lives they have? Their nametags are always green.
0,"I remember when Etho pranked Guude with the boats on the Mindcrack SMP, good times, good times"
0,I'm not sure who is behind the mods and plugins on this server but I wanna say thank you so much for making such an awesome series possible!!
0,"I am hopeful that before chest sneaking is added, ethos remakes his ""bottomless pit"" from mindcrack"
9,"16:00
That's it.  End the series.  Can't go out on a higher note than this. XD"
0,8:00 Does Etho know how rabid that wouldve made the ShinyDuo fans if he did that?
0,Whatever happened to pop sieg? Bring back OOGE
0,I love your videos please don't get abducted by aliens
0,lmao
0,why is bdubs so funny
0,There were so many funny moments in this 😂
0,6:40 Ngl i thought it was etho's lets play seed and we are looking at the you been ethoed pond but with martyn's face
0,Next Life series.... Welcome to Serious/Real Life. Every Hermit Streams the ENTIRE episode
0,i loveeeeee the longer episodes from everyone this series!
0,"Why not just ""The Cabin Folk""?"
0,Showing off his tiktok awareness to compensate for not knowing what studio ghibli is. xD
1,"This version feels very nostalgic. I know it's not the earliest I watched, since I started watching Minecraft when it was alpha, but I think this one had a lot of multiplayers let's play. I'm not sure if the family Let's play were earlier, but I remember the first types of SMPs began to appear around this point. One of the biggest being Hermitcrafts predecessor, Mindcrack."
2,Can we just talk about the fact that etho has now beaten gem AND Joel (possibly the best pvpers in the series) in a pvp first try! He is literally the KING of beta!❤❤❤
0,"I sat here for like 10 seconds questioning if Tango had always been british, I dont know how they fooled me"
0,"Man, sideways logs came out after I stopped playing… shortly after horses were released."
0,"I wonder how minecraft will look in five years, when our boring ol' 2025 version is crappy in comparison.
Maybe the game won't lag on java. An ai mob side kick maybe?"
0,They skipped ahead too fast!
0,That was awesome 😂😂
0,36:27 Bdubs falling for the trust with Grian after saying that’s was the best attack 😂
0,For 1.7.3 look up BoxBlair's beta transmutation machine. You can make smoothstone slabs that crash people if they hover their mouse over them in inv.
0,"booster loops still worked in this version, they worked for a few versions after the powered rails were introduced until cart collision was changed and the cart dupe bug was fixed, it was just nerfed at one point to be a bit to be less powerful before they removed it completely further down the road.  You needed the booster to be a bit longer to push the cart faster, the longer they made contact the faster they went.  if grian hadn't run out of track at the end it would have shown the catapult effect speed gain better."
1,smajor1995 really showed his age by falling for the most obvious ragebait imaginable
0,"What do you mean ""people have been on to it""? It's been incredibly obvious your thumbnails are selected for a while."
1,5 guys sitting in a hot tub 2 feet apart because... Uh.
0,It's my first time deciding to watch this series. And I will only watch this PoV
2,"He edits with his tongue a ittle out by the side, and closes one eye every time he adjusts the contrast"
1,"Re: the 1x1 hole trap - I have a very distinct memory of two players in an old Mindcrack UHC falling prey to this and losing a ton of health early on. I wanna say DocM was one, but YouTube is failing to deliver on search results"
0,I’m guilty of watching ethos old videos from a long time ago
0,"I learned only a few years ago that the redstone - obsidian transmutation trick was patched, and honestly, that was devastating"
1,"AND YOUVE GOT LIGHTS SO THE BOATS WONT GET IN!!!!!

AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
0,Can’t wait for project pokemon #2
0,this video got released at like 4am NSW and I was waiting all yesterday for it to be released from your pov
1,"Gosh he's so washed, he should lean into it and train gem"
1,"I havent laughed at a minecraft series like this in a long time, thank you etho"
81,"26:37 I love how etho is gradually getting addicted to Redstone dust, next season will be him just sniffing redstone dust or something XD"
0,every single time grians hole trap triggered etho wasnt looking lmao
0,I love ALL EthosLab videos!
0,This reminds me of the good old days with chocolate island
0,he always has to lose his first life to an explosion 😭😭😭
2,"I've been watching Etho for 10+ years and, although I don't remember most of the earliest episodes, this evokes a strong nostalgic feeling that I absolutely love! Thanks, Etho!"
0,"I’m I hearing things, or am I hearing Mumbo’s voice???"
0,"Theft, boat walls, and thumbnail editing. 

I genuinely could not breathe from laughing with the boats in the wall in the lighthouse."
0,"OH MY GOD, GEM SOUNDS LIKE A COMPLETELY NEW YOUTUBER! That threw me off😂 love gem always though, great video etho!! Thanks for always posting the best videos man, haven’t stopped getting my snacks before every video🙂‍↔️🙂‍↔️"
5,How did nobody call him Mango?
0,"Wait you're telling me that Etho does use custom thumbnails, but they are always just frames from the video. That's so based"
0,Etho is the best pov this season
5,"Etho, Casual Klepto"
2,"So far, this season is even funnier than all the others. 

It’s actually crazy how enjoyable these first two episodes are."
0,♥
0,"I cackled at that misplay, Etho. That’s was hilari"
0,i am sad you skipped so many versions
0,Why does tango sound like mumbo
0,"I somehow called it in my head this session would be Beta 1.7.3. However, I was surprised to see the Boogeyman from Last Life come back, so now I'm thinking along with jumping between major versions each session, there's also gonna be gimmicks coming from previous Life Series.

Here's how I think the whole series will play out:

Session 1: Beta 1.2, no special gimmicks (3rd Life)
Session 2: Beta 1.7.3, Boogeymen (Last Life)
Session 3: 1.0.0 (Full Release), Soulmates (Double Life)
Session 4: 1.5 (Redstone Update), Lives replaced with Time (Limited Life)
Session 5: 1.9 (Combat Update), Secret Tasks (Secret Life)
Session 6: 1.16 (Nether Update), Wildcards (Wild Life)
Session 7: Current Version, End of Series"
0,"Etho has mentioned before that he picks his thumbnails from the episodes. Maybe not directly, but he's at several points mentioned that a shot might make for a good thumbnail, or deliberately set them up. I thought that was common knowledge."
0,"I do remember, lol. It's one of several things of yours I tried to duplicate a few versions too late. The door would be open as long as the boat was burning, it was pretty cool.

Speaking of which, X-Ray glitch has to be a thing now or soon, right?"
0,Hi Etho! Do you still like Paramore?
0,He's gonna take you back to the past... to play some sheary games that cut grass.
1,"Back in these days, modding the game was the way that you made it happen! I just think they remember pistons were added because of a piston mod that was very popular. 

And I think this was around the time that full conversion mod started showing up. Or at the very least mods that added so many things and it may as well not be the same game."
0,etho pretending not to know studio ghibli or what anime 🤣🤣
705,I love how Tango clumsily edited Etho's thumbnail reveal out of Mumbo's footage. Etho literally toggles F1 in the middle of a video all the time to give himself a good thumbnail frame
1,i love this series so much it's the best of everything
1,"54:17 a SWEAR?
in MY good canadian etho video?"
14,48:58 ? Was that news? The only thing I didn't know is that he tweaks the contrast & brightness.
3,"I went back and rewatched some of your old EATS road videos, and I'm pretty sure it was in alpha. I do think you can still do a channel of water with signs so the water flow pushes you forward, but it's not as fast."
0,"Oh man, finally new boat dispenser and EATS road content I subscribed for!

(joking aside, it does take me back to those days of early minecraft and when I subscribed to your channel :D)"
0,"My 2 cents on ghibli, from someone who has seen all of their movies, and has seen *most* Disney movies, who has left behind animes because I have become tired of them;

Watch Nausica, Howl's moving castle, spirited away. These are the 3 major movies they get recognition from, I would consider it culture, regardless of how you view anime general.


My personal recommendation thought would be ""Grave of the fireflies"", but you have lost family recently and while this doesn't deal with the same age-range of loss, it can be rough. It still remains as my favorite movie from them that I will never watch again because of how real it is. It does deviate a lot from what Ghibli aspires to be, it is a hard watch whereas all the others are easy despite their deeper buried meanings, but it is the one that marked me the most.


Ghibli is akin to Disney in their aspirations in serval ways, to bring wonder to all age-ranges, but in my opinion, they succeed better in the latter age-ranges, whereas small children will be left with a lot of incomprehension that they might account to mysticism. 

I haven't watched a single anime in 4 years or so, but during the 3-4 year period where I spammed anime, as in watched full series in a day, the ones I keep in the highest esteem remain Ghibli. Yes, other studios have done great things, they still don't have the portfolio Ghibli has."
0,I'm disappointed in Etho for not knowing studio Ghibli 😢
0,"The faces are just a poor mans version of ""You've been Etho'd"""
0,Wow... new Etho lore incoming!
11,"Ah yes, the Zisteau prank from Team Canada. It was actually paintings I think but Etho discovered the boat trick nearing the end"
0,"Where does the Bdubs go? Thats right, in the square hole!"
0,29:05 sugarcane grew on left
0,17:14 speaking of llamas
0,A full hour? A gift im not sure I deserve
0,Ghibli is the best movie studio of all time. I don't think they have ever made anything short of a masterpiece.
0,This reminds me of the mind cracked smp
0,"Choosing thumbnails? After your long talk about how you think it's not worth it to choose thumbnails, & you just pick what looks the best of the preview, that you had many years ago? This is the scandal of the century!"
0,"Your thumbnails always stuck out any time i see a ""non thumbnail"" Minecraft video, my heart beats and my head rings ""Etho"""
0,:)
2,You missed a diamond it was just sticking out aswell
0,"49:45 ""creeper"" - ""aww man""
but also it was obvious that he chose the thumbnails 🤭"
0,"who is that talking about food at 2:28 because i can only heard that as mumbo
edit: oh nvm that is mumbo lol"
70,"Can i get some explaination on ""Poophose""... i don't know if i WANT to know, but like.... COME ON!!!"
209,"Scott in Wildlife: Kills Joel

0,"45:35 <3 The EATS road! I subbed because of that, once you got a microphone anyway :P Had one running right through the middle of my world."
0,This makes me want to go back and REWATCH Ethos world AGAIN.
0,32:57 did that make you juuuuump?
0,Bro doesn’t know that people are saying bro again 💔
0,you guys should start stockpiling gold. you can craft enchanted apples soon and youll need a ton of gold for it !
0,8:00 Two Germans in a hole.  oh the memories.
47,pls keep this approach it just works
0,How many times did the group blow themselves up?
0,why is mumbo tango ?
0,Why is everyone here 😂😂
0,"Yes it's 1.7, let's goo"
0,"Gosh, I can’t wait,
I wonder if they will use old glitches or silly features and things we all used to do, 
pig elevators, right clicking through stairs, cart stacking, entity stacking collision launchers, door re-log teleports, filling someone’s base with fences (like genni’s), piston melon buds instead of observers etc
But they can’t use unloaded chunk or zombie storage"
2,Etho should build a herobrine shrine
20,1:30 You're watching Eeeethooooo's labbbbb. You're watchinggg Eeeethhoooooo's LABBBBBB!
0,"Wait, it wasn't common knowledge that Etho actually chooses a frame as a thumbnail? I thought it was obvious as a random frame would most likely be a black screen or just a shot of open inventory or something. That being said, despite Etho just picking a frame, the thumbnails are actually much more clickable in comparison to other videos because counterintuitively it makes the thumbnails stand out."
0,I thought the obsidian would be a troll wth hahaha
0,Can’t wait for Etho to spend all session trying to get an anvil kill
0,"When were the ""Super Secret Settings"" added? I miss them in the newest versions."
21,the way Etho misses the sand trap Twice reminds me of school fight videos
0,So I'm guessing every session is going to take on the next seasons rules of the life series. So next is double life
1,Hmm you should have stayed in beta 1.2 the whole series imho.. this is modern minecraft already..
0,"Around 2011, the version then allowed you to put a minecart on a rail underground, with a trap door above you and when you sat in the cart looked up and clicked on the trap door you where instantly teleported above ground. It was a glitch,"
2,10:58 I have NEVER heard Etho this panicked 😂 his voice cracked!
1,"I’ve just realized that there are 5 teams and 5 players left on 6 lives

Out of those 5 who haven’t died yet, there is exactly 1 from each team

Cabin Boys:

Villains/Villies:

1 from every single team on the server"
13,"Yesss, magical Etho-obsidian 30:00 they reacted exactly as I had hoped!"
7,Mumbo talking as Tango about Tango helping Mumbo was really confusing
0,43 minutes in etho making a refrence to a tik tok and i realized he maybe does go online after uploading a vid
1,Etho! Please do a Vintage Story series w Gem!
22,"Every Etho and Gem interaction is so cute, but with Gem's broken voice, it's next level wholesome sibling vibes lol"
3,"idk if the minecraft thing still works without knowing the version, but they are incorrect about when it ended.  Powered rails were considered worthless for quite some time because of this glitch's existence"
0,Duuude that old hit noise
1,return of the boat boys
0,1.7 is where i first played
1,"The first season of the life series had no buggy man the second did, the first episod of this season had no buggy man and the second did"
0,The ending was adorable especially when Grain joined
0,Bdouble0 is legit the best
0,there was one thumbnail for a uhc with a creeper in the thumbnail but didn't actually happen in the episode
0,im genuinely so sad that there are no etho pins in the merch😭i dont usually buy merch but THAT wouldve been something that i wouldve bought💔💔
0,You should have used old title screens that also keep updating as you move up the versions
2,they really need to do the king of the hill like they did in mindcrack
2,Etho is not washed apparently. He is just out of his version lol.
0,"On the topic of your thumbnails, I remember looking back Mindcrack UHC 10 Ep 2 you specifically chose a troll one next to a creeper that never happened in the episode, that was funny"
2,"Hilarious episode,  the double square hole kills absolutely slayed me, but I'm pretty disappointed by the massive version jump. Would have been great to see minecart boosters again, they were absurd with how much speed you'd gain in seconds. Even just one more episode on pre Adventure Update beta would have been great."
1,Looks like their dads stepping up now
0,"Etho you have to watch Ghibli movies, trust us"
7,I didn't realise people *didn't* know the thumbnails were specifically chosen. Especially after the first episode of hermitcraft s8
0,I was wondering if you would break out an EATS road.
0,"I have just realized that the hermits should start a new series similar to past life but for old modpacks and revisit some of what's his names CTM maps the hardcore ones too. like the ones from ooge with guude and bdubs. I would love to see them all revisit that stuff, these nostalgia trips are bringing me back to the good days in 8th and 9th grades for me back when life was simple and before the responsibilities of adulthood. I think my first episode of ethos videos I ever watched was Ethos first episode on the mindcrack server all those years ago."
0,"Hey Etho! love your videos, I would really like to see you do return to your modded survival series!"
8,"2 things, i feel like you've talked about the thumbnail thing before
second i somewhat recall the 'shift' of thumbnails being more content relevant to the episode 'story' instead of one of 3 moments that youtube happens to pick"
1,Oh man! What a trip this series already has been. I am very much enjoying the Etho nostalgia with every version!
3,06:04 noo way that is the old minecraft panorama!
1,I LOVE seeing Etho actually have fun in Minecraft again.
1,Man… ethos video before grians lol

4,"Etho: ""The EATS road"", oh, the memories. Love it."
0,"4:49 that’s ten years ago, if you know you know"
2,I miss these beta versions of Minecraft. They have a certain atmosphere to it that's so good.
0,Hey etho I think the collision hole trap thing was definitely still a thing in that version of minecraft. I believe since the server isn't using legacy code it doesn't quite work the same
7,"""I've seen some anime"", said the man that's been dressed as Kakashi from Naruto for the last decade"
0,"I remember the redstone to obsidian thing, i honestly thought that it was still in the game but no one used it because why would you xD"
0,I forgot you had to do redstone for a 2 pressure plate door XD
0,TO BE FAIR the ethroad was like a decade and a half ago i dont think i remember anything from then either
0,I only clicked this video because of the amazing Thumbnail.
2,Pretty sure the hole trap is still coming Etho!
74,"31:05 I've seen some anime

- Etho, who's been using Kakashi skin for over a decade lol"
0,Etho uploaded before Grain 😭 I can’t watch anyone’s pov’s bc I want to watch grain’s first
5,56:33 reminds me of Better Off Dead lol - the paper boy that stalked the main character saying he wants his $2 lol 😂
0,"Seems like Etho’s ping was quite bad this session. That’s part of why he died. When you see other POVs of his death, the server thought he was way closer to the TNT when it blew up than it looks like in Etho’s POV."
83,I can’t fathom how someone can be unaware of Ghibli but know the square hole meme
1045,the boat and lighthouse joke was hilarious! and the fact they realized late made it even better :D
0,"Grian did say there were surprises so I wonder if they are not just going back in Minecraft but also the life series for each episodes gimmick

First week nothing extra
Second week Boogeyman
Third week health linked to someone else
Fourth a timer to lose a life
Fifth a secret task
Sixth an extra change to the world"
0,32:19 why are there eyes in Bdub‘s boots?
0,"Hahaha Etho, you might need to update your keyboard ;) I know, I know, it's been a while"
82,"""Tango"" and Etho talking about Thumbnails while Impulse is struggling with lava in the background is amazing"
0,the end was great
0,Watching in 480p or below is the only proper way to watch this
16,"As much as folks are ribbing you for not seeing any studio Ghibli films Etho, I recommend these two movies in particular as both a good introduction to the style, and because they have AWESOME buildings that I think you'll really dig.

- Spirited Away (the one Scott was talking about, it is indeed argued to be one of the best films of all time)
- Castle in the Sky"
0,Boat 'em is back!
45,57:45 Tango spawning in here is just a tad funny a little giggle worthy I think.
0,its so crazy i remember this update when it came out
629,"Grian, Gem, Pearl: ""We're the villains!!""

35:56 bdubs and his two nickels of respawing, angry and shouting, at places where etho happens to be in w comedic timing"

0,"Wasn’t there a version where you could get OP armour with all the protection enchants? And eventually add mending. It stays after access to it is removed, but you’d get some op gear with it."
0,I am enjoying this alot Etho
1,never saw a ghibli? i reconsider my subscription
3,"I love that blocking Cleo with cobble is still a thing, haha"
0,Guude would be proud of the boat prank
116,cant believe etho missed seeing all the times the sand pressure plate trap got activated 😭
2,Etho said he picks the thumbnail frame a loong time ago in a video
2,The lighthouse boat crashes joke was hilarious!! 😂
3,"Oh my, I didn't knew the square hole tiktok. Thank you 😂"
61,Watching Etho boat up the lighthouse reminds me of early Mindcrack when he did the same to Guude's place. Here's to hoping we get a repeat of the mushroom canopy.
0,Okay I gotta admit I too don't remember much about EATS roads lol
104,44:14 ik this is an emotional gratitude moment but gem really sounding like Tarzan rn
1271,playing old minecraft has reawakened his troll instinct
0,Why is Mumbo Tango
1,skiped so many versions thats a shame really wanted to see you show off some more old school tricks in some later versions and have all the tech introduced slower
27,54:14 I love Etho’s laugh here 😂 kinda reminds me of Zoro’s laugh
1,ETHO u need to watch Ghilbli
304,"""I've seen some anime""
-Guy who has singlhandedly changed what a Kakashi skin means in minecraft"
0,Prime Etho is a sight to see.
0,Didn’t scar technically get cured by killing Etho l
2,ok etho doesn't know studio ghibli but does know the freaking square hole tiktok
0,"""I've seem some anime"" says Kakashi"
3,"I am learning so much about the past... Mostly pranks, but so much nonetheless. Thanks for the episode! (I laughed quite a bit at your ""I would never hurt my friend Joel :)"" vibe followed by Joel giving you the weirdest look and backing away... He does not trust...)"
0,Etho thumbnail lore???
1,Where does the Skizz go? That's right. He goes in the square hole.
297,10:57 probably the MOST panic Etho has ever displayed
0,Ethos so out of touch he doesn’t know ’bro’ is back :D
0,21:12  General Spaz gets revenge?
120,"50:40 that is like the most casual scathing self roasting comment I've ever heard lmao. If anyone else had said it, I would think it was unintentional."
386,"The sudden juxtaposition at 25:24 between the dark night, the murder, and the running convicts, to... ""boy, sugarcane grows fast :D"", was certainly something."
0,Why is Tango sounds like Mumbo?
13,"I am surprised they didn’t make a bunch of oak slabs, which don’t burn and are mined with a pickaxe in this version, and rebuild the cabin so it won’t be susceptible to fire."
0,Thank you for the episode 😅
0,Can’t wait to go on another nostalgia trip with Etho!
0,"Patch 1.8 Pre-release = Added sprinting.

1.5	13w05b	Stairs no longer prevent sprinting.
1.7.2 13w36a  Added ""Sprint"" button, defaulting to Left Ctrl."
0,"im wondering if one of the secondary gimmicks to this series is revisting past gimmicks, like, ep 1 was blank, no gimmick just learning old minecraft, today is the bogeyman? i could be wrong and its just only a reintroduction of the bogey and ep 1 was just a safe day"
0,"The fact Etho can't remember to build the EATS road, a thing HE invented, is hilarious"
2,"50:00 And probably just because he said that he does it he didn't actually do it for this episode, it is legit one of the semi-random ones provided by youtube"
0,Nice they are jumping multiple versions at a time.
0,"I really liked all of the shenanigans, especially the boat pranking."
3,I hope they play on the version where you can shift off of chests and fall down
94,Genuinely thought the thumbnail thing was common knowledge. It's super noticable.
0,"Etho I beg you to try some Studio Ghibli movies! Fantastic worldbuilding, animation and visual style overall. Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa for darker stories, Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle for more whimsical and weird but brighter stories."
11,"37:40 I feel the same that whenever I return to old versions out of nostalgia, I can't stand more than a few hours. There are a lot of comfort things missing we have today, but back then it was just peak entertainment. I mean way back into the past, 2009/2010. It's also the era where if you open someones world, every 25-100 blocks is a new building completely out of theme, while nowadays people build things that are more connected, which is really a unique style from that period (mostly because you didn't have a lot of ways to really blend stuff in, limited block selection in general but also a lack of experience). Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time just to experience that again"
3,You know what goes in the square hole? That’s right! The triangle :-)
1,That boat mechanic _has_ to come back. I get that boats sink when submerged. But rafts don't.
458,The whole thumbnail conversation feels illegal even if it is known
13,This series feels like an major anime flashback episode 14 years in the making
22,The way there were so many deaths in this episode and only a few were boogy kills
2,dude! that issue with the doors! I remember watching redstone tutorials for opening the two doors at the same time
46,14:15 sounds crazy with etho saying it lol
3,Etho are you gonna be crafting Notch apples
1,53:45 Love that
0,"etho you need to get into ghibli, watch at least the classics like spirited away and howls moving castle. grave of the fireflies is also one of my favorites but it is extremely sad"
0,"I'll always love you Etho, no matter how washed"
0,I find it funny that scar always kill etho even when they are in the same team
162,"18:57 ""LOOKS LIKE THE HAMMER JUST FOUND A NAIL!"""
3,Etho you have to craft a god apple
910,"When Grian showed the ""the spot"" I immediately knew. What a cool callback"
1,Are Etho and Bdubs TRYING to die with their lack of decent armor? Lmao
422,Etho should drop two diamonds into lava in front of skizz next episode
8,"Etho's general game mechanics are about a B+
Etho's game mechanics when it comes to pranks are an S++ tier"
0,Tumbo Tekko is a great addition to the series
0,this is so peak
0,Etho’s POV!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
0,"Good News: I'm pretty sure the 2 people in a hole not being able to get out thing is in future versions. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Hardcore where Doc and his teammate got stuck in a hole was after Beta.

Bad News: I'm sure people will see it coming now that you've tried."
0,I hope that tango being played by someone else is a staple now
7,"if episode 1 had life series 1 mechanics (none) and episode 2 has life series 2 mechanics (boogeyman), maybe we can expect a similar gimmick next sessions so next one is going to be double life with a random partner probably.

probably next session is going to be either 1.0 release, or maybe they go all the way to 1.5. usually life series end in 8 episodes and they have to reach 1.21 by 8.that means we have 6 episodes to basically jump 21 versions. i assume that 1.0,    1.5,    1.9,   1.16,   1.18 and  1.21 are good candidates 1.13 could also be one

1.0 is the release
1.5 is the redstone update
1.9 is the combat update (<-most hated for me)
1.16 is nether update
1.18 the update the changed the world
1.21 current one

1.13 is the update aquatic btw"
7,"etho, studio ghibli is going to change your life"
6,"man i love seeing all the old tech and stuff; the redstone obisidian stuff is something that lives in my heart forever and i kinda wish was still in the game just for fun
really hope you milk some squids when squids; its my favourite bug in the game ever (assuming you dont skip straight to a version where its patched next episode)"
0,fun fact Etho killing Joel in revenge for him boogey killing smajor is the second time Smajor has been instantly avenged by his teammate after being boogey killed by Joel in the life series
0,"THIS is what last life should be

no overbearing stup!d gimmicks

just entertaining players.playing classic mimecraft

i just want the latest version of minecraft smp with ONE new gimmick and no other gimmicks every season.  one light gimmivk that doesnt completely overpower everything else"
4,I clearly remember when Pistons were a mod... And it feels like Trap Doors were added yesterday...
0,I FORGOT IT WAS PAST LIFE TODAY this is great news
1,"Very on-brand for the Rushmore faces to be blocking ""sacred"" land."
4,Actually turned into the Minecraft that is still in my mind.

3,"10:12
Slab of the Well, what is your wisdom?"
8,Comparing Ghibli to Disney is so wild. They are so very different.
0,You know I thought this was the panorama world last episode but when nobody mentioned it I was doubting myself.
2,oh my god the boat prank brings me back
3,this might be my favourite life series so far because of all the nostalgia
0,Etho I’m sure that trick you did on grian and bdubs will work on a different version coming up I remember that killing people in UHC multiple times
20,Gem and Pearl trapped in a hole for an hour would've been hilarious 😂
7,Petition for Etho to make a new mini series continuing chocolate island in 1.7.3
11,11:12 There's no way that doesn't make it into the out of context clips
30,18:40 well I️ mean Etho’s kill is valid even tho Scott had already been killed
0,Bogeymannnn

7,"I remember so well taking a friend to a very old version where you also couldn't sprint and she went ""I can't wait to get Elytras, the normal walking is killing me"". Yea buddy I got bad news for you :'D"
5,30:48 Etho not having seen any Ghibli movies is SHOCKING
1,The Eats-road trial was honestly so nostalgic
1984,Etho having Kakashi as his minecraft skin but now knowing Ghibli is so unreal but its etho so
5177,"""I saw some animes""  etho said while wearing an anime skin"
6,I’ve been refreshing all morning
812,10:58 Probably the most emotive Etho has ever been
1,Horn idea: “What are you doing you crazy psycho!?!?”
7,"Hey Slab, just wanted to let you know I recently got into Bonsai, and as I started researching plants and such, it reminded me of your work on your greenhouse. I hope you’re doing well and taking time for both youtube and yourself, love ya lots buddy"
0,I just noticed it's so easy to snoop and steal because the chests aren't entities yet so it's completely silent.
102,ethos about to go on a studio ghibli rabbit hole. when i first discovered it i was obsessed
645,"The 1x1 hole thing was _way_ later. It was in mindcrack UHC season 12 with Docm and JL2579, which would have been during 1.6 (horse update), long in the future still."
0,Please set up the piston push limit-  tree trap.
0,Every time I click on your videos I freak out at that sick intro.

0,Hearing the random Mumbo voice was WILD
0,This man ain’t never beating no custody allegations lol
34,"I'm surprised they went straight to 1.7. I have tons of nostalgia for 1.7 because it felt like the first step into ""modern"" Minecraft with the introduction of pistons."

0,You should try and collect cursed items from each version
0,If I had a nickel for every time Joel got a bogey kill on Scott and then immediately got killed after by his teammate…
0,scar arguing at the portal made me unreasonably mad

1371,Etho not knowing Ghibli is so surprising and not at all surprising at the same time
38,"Never got to experience these older versions, was too young when they came out, but its so interesting and cool seeing etho use his knowledge of these versions to come up with so much shenanigans lol 😂"
0,i love how you just nab people's saddles under their noses
0,"Well well well, you guys did the boat thing

2,Ive never been this early to an etho video! Im excited!
276,I love the fact that this was episode 2 and the boogeyman was introduced in last life which was season 2
11,"Remember this? I do! I remember how excited I was to see an Etho video so fresh. I remember it because in 10 years, maybe more, that excitement has never failed. I remember this very well :') Thank you Etho for being a constant, safe space for me <3"
0,"Snack Streak 99: LETS GOOO etho and I got myself a wendys taki meal, honestly I really like them even if they are sending some people to the hospital if you are sensitive to takis (like cant eat a whole bag without getting tummy ache) then I would not rec but I like it"
0,"The only things I️ really noticed were the existence of birch saplings, and that the cobblestone looks normal now"

0,"Not only was Etho the first person I ever watched play Minecraft, he was my INTRODUCTION into Minecraft. I knew nothing about the game, and I didn’t even know what a ""let’s play"" was….

Seeing him play on this version again and listening to him explain how to play brought back the feeling of discovering Minecraft for the first time AND gaming videos in general for me :’)"
0,Old MC with Etho and bdubs holy thats my childhood right there

1,Wow good job on finding this old video in your files etho
0,I was maybe five in 2011? lol and I can legally drink so... :>
0,18:00  Joel… NOOOO! (look at his legs.)
0,How I used to make a hot tub is you put netherrack and light it on fire and put one block above the fire and however wide you want the hot tub and then the water and the smoke comes through the one block.
0,Either I started playing Minecraft at the age of 6 or 7. I was 6 in 2012 so yeah I do remember some of this. It was pocket edition we didn’t get Minecraft on the computer till I was 8 and my brother was 10. He got it for his 10th birthday. I remember naming a chicken 1.2 because that was the version. I also remember brutally executing chickens.
0,Cant wait for them to bring up fire proof houses with the old wooden slabs :D
0,Oh man when Martyn mentioned the old minecraft music I ended up having to go back and listen to them again. Such good times dude.

0,Duncan’s brain needs to be studied

0,is it time for the etho scott team up?? omg! so excited :D
0,Wow seeing this game version is wildly nostalgic.
0,"I may be half of Etho’s age (unless he’s, you know, one of the ancient ones popping up everywhere these days) but this is still also my version of Minecraft and I’m almost as giddy watching this as he sounds playing it. Again, the most wholesome person out there on the internet"
0,21:44 so much for inventory issues. :)) )
0,Etho's pov is even more of a delight to watch than usual 💚 the nostalgia!
1,"You absolutely NAILED the verbal version of your intro. I heard it initially and as I thought about it, I really noticed how much you got it spot on. Been watching since you played in the old world. Keep up your skilled gameplay legend :)"
0,"Etho basically exudes ""Do not cite the deep magic to me witch, I was there when it was written  and ""I was there, Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago."" vibes with this one."
0,Nothing has changed even after 13 years 😅
0,@ethoslab have you ever tried the Create mod?
1,Please make an EATS road

0,Missed the opportunity to use the old start
0,"As a fellow alpha/beta tester, I'm impressed with how much you remember 😯 I did remember the boat trick though, as I used it as an elevator back in the day 😎"
0,Hey ethos question will you and everyone from mindcrack ever do another server or modded server like ftb ? And would you ever do any new ctm maps or modded maps yourself?
0,Should kept the cobblestone looking like this best version evr
0,Can’t wait to watch Etho this season. He is absolutely in his element. I can absolutely see him winning. Or maybe Gem
1,Joel is in a cartoon at 19:02 when he just floats in midair until he realised the block was broken😭
0,"Gotta love Skizz rolling up and accusing Etho of stealing two diamonds. Etho's defense is: ""What a coincidence! I have two diamonds on me!"" And Skizz is mollified."
1,"OMG, could you imagine if there was hardcore in Beta, and you lose your hardcore world, not because you died, but because you got stuck in a fence and couldn’t get out"
0,"Etho at 14:02: you good Martin?
*Martin immediately explodes right after*"
0,Used to watch BDubs and GenerikB back in the day.. haven't played this game in years.
0,"Dang, I watched Shadow of Israphel with my mom when the episodes were coming out.  What a time to remember..  I even went as Israphel for Halloween one year - I think my Mom was the only other person who knew who I was dressed up as >.<  Good times"
0,"gosh darnit, I had this ""update a server"" idea like 2 years ago. It didn't have the life stuff but still. I'm glad someone is doing the idea, honestly probably better then I would've"
0,Etho getting all the comments about being old when I'm 99% sure he's younger than me. They're like daggers to the soul. 🤣
0,I wish Etho did a call back with his old intro for this series 😢
0,What hurts me the most about the farming is everyone just walking on the crops and destroying them. YOU GOTTA SHIFT WALK OVER TILLED SOIL!!!!!!!!!!
0,Isn't the farmland fence trick from a later version?

0,E to the T to ur mom?
0,I need a counter for how much red stone Etho has been gifted each episode
0,"i'm honestly surprised none of you thought to build a quick and dirty water dump farm, water harvesting fully grown wheat was a thing by that version if i remember correctly, and there were a lot of designs that didn't need redstone, i've still got a couple built in my old singleplayer world where you just yanked out a dirt block to flood the field, then put it back to stop the water, and manually collected the pile at the bottom of the field and replanted from the side rails so that you didn't step on the farmland.  It was painful and slightly hilarious seeing everyone forget crop crushing existed though.  Seeing an older version of the game again did give me that warm fuzzy yet slightly homesick feeling though.  nice to see you all having fun with it though ^_^"
0,Loving the retro playthrough!

0,"I very much doubt it would happen, but I think it would be hilarious if when beta 1.7.3 is reached - one former minecracker kurtjmac shows up still on his journey to the farlands."
1,I watched a bunch of pov's and I think Etho might win this season due to how well he did this episode and even if it updates I think It will take at least 6 episodes if this is a regular length season and I know that some people that are better at new game will be better then I think its likely that they lose almost most of their lives before then another person I think will do well is impulsesv however in the first episode he didn't do to much and I'd like to bring up ethos teammates like smajor will help them stay alive and I know the players won't let him win another season so etho won't have to worry about him and the others won't be that bad or good
3,I was so waiting for someone to say that at least Etho's hair color is accurate.
0,Martin did Screw the Nether?!?!?! The legend gets better!!!!

2,"Y'know what would have been epic, if Etho brought back the logitech headset and the quiet commentary style"
0,"I'm loving the nostalgia. It's like a trip down memory lane.

I started playing in 2013, and a lot of stuff was in Java by then, but I was playing on my tablet. I don't remember what we called that version, because this was before it became Bedrock. And anyway, the tablet version of Minecraft was very basic and didn't have all the Java frills.

I would mine around any redstone ore I found because redstone ore didn't drop any redstone dust. But it was going to be in a future update, so I left all the redstone ore in my worlds' mines so I could get it later."
1,Love you Etho! Been a huge fan for over 7 years now 😄
1,I would love to see an Alpha/Beta mini series from Etho
1,Everyone giving red stone to etho bc they don’t know what to do cracks me up🤣

0,Poor Gem literally sounds like Eeyore 😂
0,"The furnace trap was because shift click didn't exist and so you couldn't place blocks cuz wherever you looked, you'd end up in a menu instead (Old Pakratt knowledge ftw)"
2,Great great episode Etho! Slight disappointment that the game will be updated as the season goes but that’s due to my own expectations haha. Updating is a great idea too though if I’m honest
0,They better make the patch museum!
0,this was a great trip down memory lane:)
0,"Who are you, and what have you done to etho???? :D
You're supposed be talking like your parents are sleeping next room, this is just wrong :DD

0,You have got to build an eets road!!!
0,"I really hope you take the chance to build an EATS system(even if its just a single part like the boat dispenser) before this series patches far enough to break it. 

It's a bit selfish but I really liked that system and hope you get to show it off again."

0,"I headed out with Grian to tour his farm, and he started introducing me to some of the livestock, mentioning how he had named them after his fellow players, as the unhinged animals they were. Just then, I was hit by an unbearable stench. With my eyes watering uncontrollably, I questioned through gritted teeth, “What in the hell is that smell?” 

He looked over knowingly and said: ""Ah. Etho? The goat is never washed.”"
0,Etho don't let joel make you insecure that 2011 intro is still great 😤

0,"otary Members: Falun Gong Practitioners Are Admirable

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS) and a quality engineer in the U.S., said that he had learned about the CCP’s live organ harvesting when he attended a meeting in Houston, where a Falun Gong practitioner talked about her experience of being forced to work for no pay and having her blood drawn in a forced labor camp.

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS)

After watching the film, he was both sad and angry. Mr. Stansell said, “It’s really hard to accept that there’s a country and a government behind this. We rely on the government to protect us and guard us, but a government is doing this. It’s really heartbreaking, frustrating, infuriating, and sad.

“Those who stick to their beliefs deserve our admiration. They endure all kinds of torture and do not abandon their beliefs. This really makes many of us ashamed.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club from Kansas, U.S., finished watching the movie in tears. “This is so heartbreaking. I can’t bear it,” she said. “This is so shocking, it’s hard to believe this is true, it’s hard to believe this kind of thing can happen in the world.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club

Rolf Thingvold, a Rotarian and senior sales executive at a large Norwegian software company, said “State Organs” was a very moving and powerful story and that the organizers had done a great job. He also understood that “the filmmakers took a big risk.”

And your minecraft skin
And uh oh you don't like change? Nevermind then..."

0,I love the nostalgia of this. And making some of the more modern mods like prox chat working on such an old version of MC couldn't have been easy!
0,"Just came across a somewhat older pack ""Techopolis 3"" that looks like it's right up your alley, though it may also be a bit too repetetive. Still, since I loved the Project Ozone LP so much, wanted to let you know. It's more heavily focused on production or I should say industry and can also be played as Skyblock version (which I think is probably more appealing). Ex Nihilo is also replaced by something else (dont wanna spoil) so at least that core part is very different"
0,"I gotta say I love this series so far. Even though its a life series and sh1t is going to go down someday but this start is so humble and chill, I love all the old school builds and mechanics!"

0,2:25 idk why but skizz question made me pause for a moment and replay it to rehear what I Heard
0,Wow you guys have the manliest team this season with your cool manly cottagecore cabin
0,"9:50

I've been wanting to do this forever. The nastalgia is so strong. I know Minecraft was just in its infancy, but memory serves that it was kind of a better game back then.

Also, I'd like to say I've been watching etho since back then. The golden era of YouTube as a whole. Crappy screen recorders, bandicam and fraps with the fps in the corner. We didn't have the phone cameras of today, so all the videos were 240p.. Ugh, take me back"

1,Should’ve had Kurtjmac in this one
0,i am going to cry tears of joy if there are boat contraptions featured in this series
0,we need u to downgrade ur mic and recording setup back to the 2011 days to get the true experience
0,"People used furnaces for traps as part of a BUD system.  The furnace cooks for a long time before turning off, which then triggers a block update.  It was a small clock, basically, and all you had to do was cook a stack of cobble."

1,"Hey Etho! I think it'd be cool if you continued Choco Island on Beta 1.7.3 as a side project! You wouldn't need to commit all your time to it, but episodes every so often when you have a new build idea would be fun."

0,Etho in this series is gonna be LEGENDARY!
0,i love whatever the heck Etho and gem have going on this season
0,This seems like a very bingeable series
2,Oldschool etho shenanigans.
0,haha its wild seeing this big popular youtubers not knowing anything about early Minecraft. They aren't real OGs
0,The lighting at night kinda feels like old terraria lighting? Idk why
2,"Etho: gets new computer, to play beta 1.2 lmao"

2,Sick Gem sounds like Jinx :O
0,Can't wait for EATS roads haha
2,Etho talking about SoI is a weird mental ich scratched that I didnt even know I had.
0,Really enjoyed this episode. I was thinking of the Yogscast while watching and it was cool to hear the little bit of lore about Martin playing Um Bongo. Looking forward to next week's episode!
25,"Etho's an alpha amongst beta's 37:20 the way I screamed when he beat gem trololololol, I had a stupid grin on my face the entire episode"
0,"I've realized now, almost all of my knowledge in Minecraft still is stuck in beta or earlier."
1,WAZZAAAAAAP 💀
0,I remember how nice it was when infinite water source was added. It was not in the original version.
4,"I actually prefer ""Sulphur"" over ""Gunpowder"" because of the simple fact that there aren't any guns in Minecraft."
0,Why old version less to do with older version
0,If beta 1.2 is so cool why haven't they made beta 1.3 yet
1,I love how etho is practically teaching everybody how to play minecraft again
0,Etho not throwing the first diamond into the lava felt weird
1,I’m home
0,"10:15 I'm so glad to hear this, because that was exactly my problem with Minecraft when I played it in 1.0. I didn't understood I had to keep the left mouse button pressed and I kept spamming it. It took the entire first day to mine some wood and than I died in the first night.
I just came back to it a week later (I think) after some friends joined."
0,Petition for Etho to Build an EATS road.
78,scott using etho as a travel guide is sooo funny 😭😭😭
505,38:08 I️ love how illegal this fight was. Like this is just straight up green on green violence. And everyone just decided it would be funny anyways.
0,"3:41 I think the trap Etho is referring to is the trap Zisteau made (and never used) back in the Mindcrack days that was essentially just a massive pit lined with furnaces. You couldn’t shift-click interactable blocks to place blocks on them in the old versions, so if you tried to pillar out or bridge off of the central platform, you’d just open the furnace’s inventory. Anyone caught in the trap would essentially just be forced to jump down the pit and die.

This will probably get patched out by the time Etho is on a red life, but it would be fun to see this concept come back in 2025"
0,He really is into parkour lately
0,the grin on my face as i watch this. boutta check if theres a new How to survive and thrive video after this
0,I've figured out how to make micro wireless Redstone controllers.

1,This isn’t fair for everyone else with etho in his element
0,I think this might be the first life series where Etho isn't washed up
0,"Says there won't be any inventory issues, later spends several seconds trying to figure out how to not drop anything."
31,"Etho please blow their minds with “redstone transmutation” you can turn redstone into obsidian for the next few versions, 1.2-1.7, just put redstone where the block will form in a cobblestone generator, flowing water+flowing lava+redstone makes obsidian to build a portal with one lava bucket.  Will be legendary knowledge for all these new guys 😓😓😶‍🌫😶‍🌫"
0,"the forest just eternally burning down in the background during the cabin arc is great, nobody even mentions it."
5,6:23 I️ love how the chests really do look bigger even tho it’s only by like one pixel
0,"44:40 I was not hearing ""horizontal logs"" but I was hearing ""w____s on a logs"" lmao"

0,Etho not burning his first diamonds? This beta must be real hard

0,"54:07
Just to point out that your house is more flammable than theirs."
1,missed opportunity to be the cabin crew 👀. i love the longer episode and so excited to see how this life series will play out!! 🙂🙂

0,Etho's season ?!??! so excitedd
1,"Poor Gem... Sick and dealing with Bdubs's shenanigans... at least she still is here, I'm glad to see her in the life series again."
0,You should make a little colluseum for people to fight every episode
0,"11:33
Scott and Etho looking for diamonds vs Grian. 😂"
0,bdubs flying at 43:05
0,05:00 in my head he is eternally 32
0,"Everyone trying to figure out how Beta works, meanwhile Etho quite literally invented and discovered things back in the day (anyone remember his old wood dupe video?)"
0,I am SO excited for this team up. Scott and etho is a duo I didn’t think we would ever get but I’m so glad we have. Also maybe we’ll finally get a season where scar doesn’t terrorize/murder etho 😅 it’s so fun seeing etho in his element
0,I love how much of a sensai etho is being just like his skin's sake. 😊 🥰
0,I think fences underneath farmland didn't prevent it before 1.6. Sneaking should though
0,"I love this, it feels so nostalgic I hope they do more of this. I think Grian use to do a series similar where they slowly progress through the versions"
0,I will be watching this
0,"I really miss the old like seed or wheat thingy stage growth, no matter what, I get always confused with the current one either if it's actually fully growth or not, unless there's one that actually look different from the rest XD"
0,11:23 someone is for sure going to make an edit where it cuts to Grian losing his mind with the diamonds
0,The level of nostalgia has just hit me so hard. I've been watching Etho since day 1. Chocolate island and all. Who remembers the clay? Spaz? I'm only 20 minutes in and having such a good time. The boat stuff is so good lmao
0,48:04 you know what screeeeeeeewww the netherr
0,Well apparently Grian was the only one having an 'Authentic' Beta diamond experience. Poor lil' guy was almost crying.
1,"this brings me back to playing pocket edition on my iPod touch as a kid, so nostalgic"
0,"Mojang created Minecraft beta 1.2_02. When they logged in, Etho was there already."
0,"Ahh, the Etho perspective: reminds me of UHC and RFTW"
0,"Grian: I have spent THIRTY MINUTES looking for no diamonds!
Etho: Oh wow, I could've sworn these were harder to find back in the day!
XD"
0,32:24 omg what happened to gem’s voice
0,I hope we get to experience the April Fools updates too
0,The juxtaposition of Grian’s episode where he goes absolutely insane trying to find diamonds while Etho and Scott just stumble over them every 5 minutes is hysterical
0,"""there's no monopolizing in this series"" meanwhile etho with all the redstone on the server on session one....."
0,I'm looking forward to next episode where they can run but not up stairs only half slabs
0,"8:46 you have no idea how much i miss finding diamonds like this, caves and cliffs was amazing and all, but i wish theyd kept diamonds spawning just above deepslate. Got the 360 version for Christmas when i was 13 in 2013 after playing it with my friend on their computer. Man i feel old 😂"
0,"Holy moly, beta 1.2_02 was my first Minecraft version!!"
0,"I love this Etho, very nostalgic for a multitude of reasons!"
0,I seriously thought this was just another one of his playthroughs based on the thumbnail 😂
0,Etho being the OG minecraft guru is such good content. this is incredible!
0,Now etho just needs to get all monotone 😂😂
0,So wholesome 😍
0,"This is the moment you’ve been waiting for Etho! Not washed up if we are playing in the minecraft equivelant of the 1920’s! 


You absolutely should try and recreate your original boat dispensing machine for old times sake❤ show what brought you on the map. Think alot of life members would find that awesome aswell!"
12,"The irony of Tango going ""come on"", when Etho explains the basics of farming (you need water, light, tilt soil, seeds), then wondering why his crops died due to lack of water 😂"
2,having him on ur team is like hacing divine guidance from a wise old soul
0,Etho you nailed the intro sound effect oh my gosh
0,Etho sound like a grand pa who taught his kids  to use old computer  that they found in storage room.
2,Etho is no longer washed up! Can't wait until things fall apart later.
0,Oh the good ol' times lol
0,everyone giving Etho redstone xD
0,Oh my; I miss these days 😅
0,"can't be certain bout these things, but I believe crops need sky. like they can only be outside, on the surface, not underneath a roof, not under naturally occuring blocks. actual sky sky. also, more light is better, so yeah, don't skimp on lighting. every block of crop needs at least 4 light sources next to it on all sides."
0,hold space to not take fall damege in water
0,51:04 It's because it needs to be planted soil. At least if I remember right.
1,I can’t wait for this version of etho just living nostalgia
60,"Etho’s team is so good for this: Etho - smart redstoner, Scott - smart social engineer, Scar - most likely to kill a lot of people on red life, Bdubs - to build good roofs!"
0,This is like when Anton Ego took a bite of Remy's ratatouille and was reminded of his mother's cooking.
0,33:13 gem sounds so distraught here it brought tears to my eyes 😭😭😭
0,good'ol days back
10,We didn’t build cottagecore houses back then. Bases were more squareish with big windows.
1,"Hey there Etho, long time ago you have played TerraFirmaCraft in minecraft, but have you seen the game VintageStory? I myself started what seems not so long ago but I already have ~100 hours."
0,It’s so funny how the newer players act like this version sucks when Minecraft was already a global phenomenon at this point
0,You're good stuff Etho
5,"20:18 So THAT'S why Pause would say ""i can see your face whenever you shift""! I remember that from one of the Zisteau pranks back in the day"
0,I have water-ladder flash back
1,Boat elevator!!
3,the amount of redstone *everyone* kept giving him is so funny

1,All I need to see if the etho cave that's all
0,Oh this thumbnail gives me early hermitcraft vibes
0,Etho in beta again. Couldn't be more nostalgic. Be sure not to mine any clay to annoy everyone. ^_^
0,I have a distinct memory of sitting outside of my granparents cottage on the ground to watch etho in 2011
0,"I don’t even watch etho that often but I’m watching this cuz etho playing beta again will prolly never happen again lol, this made me feel nostalgic and I started Minecraft way later"
2,How many episodes until the house burns down?
0,This oddly feels right
0,"I'm 11 again, holy moly"
0,"#47 on trending for gaming on 7/12/25, 20 hours after upload"

21:35 *Spends a full 18 seconds in paralysis whilst deciding what to get rid of from his full inventory*"
0,The evil team is planning sneaky things
0,"Wearing iron boots tramples crops. Tango was wearing them, you weren’t. Now get off my (crops) lawn!"
0,"Expert gaslight, “so you’re choosing to not trust the whole world cus you lost your diamonds”"
3,Can't wait to see the differences in Etho's skin over the versions/years!
0,"Every version, two must either volunteer as tribute or be drawn as tribute for a battle to the death…"
1,I though Etho would show em how to make blue fire with those diamonds! ;)
1,"If yall get your hands on some OG wood slabs, you can do cabin core without fear of your house being burnt down"
0,"Oh my god, I'm back to the past."
2,I remember you can use the 2x2 crafting space in the inventory for storage back then
3,"Everyone: Let me guess, your home?

Etho: It was... and it was beautiful..."
0,chocolate Island <3
0,"I prefer old gravel
I am disgusting"

1,the others are going to regret calling etho washed up this season!
0,6ft away in the hot tub
0,"See Etho isn't washed, he just got out version updated."
0,Can't wait when they reach a version where they introduce Herobrine
0,Etho please this is the series you HAVE to win!!
0,"Me and Scott both have the same reaction the first time I saw Minecraft, I too used to say that this game is terrible and who in their right mind would play this game but look at me now watching and appreciating all the content creators who make awesome builds and redstone machines playing this game and maybe soon consider playing it too in the future but not right now because I don't have the phone capacity nor PC to download the game yet"
0,I’ve missed Etho.
0,ngl i thought Skiz just dropped the F-bomb at 2:25
0,We are so baaaack
0,I forgot you used to punch sheep for their wool lmao
0,"Starting the new series with Etho's video first, as has become tradition.  You certainly did not disappoint!"
1,the etho WASSSUP was insane
1,"I like how etho and gem just completely forgot they were playing the life series, and decided to have a duel even though they are both green."
0,Why does gem sound like that ??
0,wazzuuuuuuuuuup
0,"Ah Minecraft Beta, the jank that you were."
0,Makes me want Etho / Hermits to do a full Beta world

1,This was such a great episode. This has got to be in my top 10 favorite etho videos.
0,Etho is like the old man NPC from Terraria
0,i love how dark beta nights are
0,1:04 RIP CAPTAIN
0,Etho is in his battleground now
0,"My first ever Etho video, and also my first Minecraft video ever, first gaming video I had ever watched, was the old beta wood duplication glitch with boats, cactus, and no mics. Shoutout to the return"
0,33:23 yeah she does hahaha she sounds so sad
0,etho is like ahh yes we're back
0,"OK but Scott's story about when he first tried playing minecraft is so interesting to me 'cause I remember the first time I tried to play it I knew nothing about it and had only heard it mentioned and how much people liked it - so I spawned in at night and just kept getting killed by mobs and until it was finally daytime, then I just kept tapping things and wandering around and there was literally just grass and trees and I was like ... well, this sucks - and I didn't play again for years until I started randomly watching minecraft videos 😅"
0,I remember watching some of Etho's earlier videos where the other players were teasing Etho about being young.  Now he's the old pro.
0,Love how Etho decided to go back to his old skin during this series. Such great attention to detail.
0,This same concept was something I wanted to do back when release 1.0 came out lmao looks fun
2,Etho should bring back the old intro for this series!
0,Etho can you play vintage story  please ? ❤
0,Name the pumpkin guy Mykol.
0,"Etho missed the opportunity to use his old intro, also sad to see he didn't throw the diamonds in the lava to piss someone off lmao"
0,i love this team-up! this was so nostalgic and i love seeing how happy you are in your element!
0,"Etho, ""whassup"" wasn't 2011. That commercial was only on the air from, 1999 to 2002."
0,If the next version is 1.8 where blocking with a sword was a thing then I feel everyone should at least try pvp if they want.
0,Haha I love this so much <3
0,They must have known what we wanted most! Thanks for the nostalgic dive back into Minecraft Beta!
1,"16:00 Bdubs watching having flashbacks of screaming ""ONE POINT THREEEE"""
0,great vid etho

0,Petition to do RFW again.
0,Memories
0,19:44 Can't believe Etho let that one go
0,Shadow of Israphel.... Old boats.... The OOMFH sound effect.... I'm instantly brought back 15 years. I love this.
0,"Oh, how I've missed you beta minecraft"
0,51:48 the CLAAAWW!   lol
15,Etho’s insistence on full torch coverage makes a lot of sense when you see how things used to be
0,This video must be watched in 360p
0,Old wheat texture brought back memories.. crazy!!
0,no dropping a diamond into lava
0,"Boat button? Thought you didnt have a mic back in the beta Etho, this doesnt feel right."
0,WAZAAAAA
0,"41:25 I believe it was that you need to log out and log in, and then the sand looks solid."
0,Placing saplings next to the rejects base took me back. Still a great troll 😂😂😂
0,"I like the fact that almost instantly, Etho and Scott found diamonds while Grian and Pearl suffered for approximately 47 minutes"
0,Gem voice very sexy this episode xP
0,I love everybody handing Etho the method of their destruction (redstone)
0,"3:33 ""this is back when you weren't washed"" 😂 I loved that the washed up joke keeps continuing forward"
0,"when's the last time you've played beta minecraft, etho?"
1,ouch poor gem. that voice sweet child.
0,1:45 oh my gosh i'm dying laughing
0,Etho you should recreate your famous base.
0,"The reason the crops are not working because it needs sunlight/sky can not farm in cave or building, I did a lot of experimenting as a young fella."
0,"3:50 Furnaces were used as traps because in this version there is no sneak + place.
Pakratt used this on mindcrack in a (failed due to discovery) prank where the trapped person would be unable to escape as they couldn't reach the walls or bridge to escape a fall trap."
0,"my favourite part of this new season is how everyone's standards for building have adjusted for beta minecraft XD 
tbf the cabin house is pretty cool <3"
0,The firstborn elf tells the people of Middle-earth how they lived before they saw the light of Valinor
0,"Between my nostalgia and Etho's nostalgia, this was really fun to watch."
0,47:28 NO WAY UM_BONGO WAS JUST MENTIONED IN 2025 🗣️🗣️
0,I absolutely love watching Etho play old Minecraft again. I've watched through his entire LP like 5 times. Place the fences under the dirt so you don't trample farmland. SMP was always way glitchier than single player.
0,this series was made specifically to give etho a playable visualizer of his entire adult life
3,Oddly enough they wouldn't feel anything different if you show this to anyone who watches etho back in 2011. Just a usual Etho let's play
0,i'm just so impressed someone ported the voice chat mod to beta minecraft
0,Love it and going down memory lane myself .... I remember as if it was yesterday .... I was addicted to MC at  once! And so afraid of the mobs that I played in peaceful mode for a long time. 😅 Thanks Etho for the joy you bring ❤
0,Etho is back on top!
0,So I guess the falling sand is a conversion pit?
0,Goated intro
1,"This might be the latest I’ve been to an Etho video in years, looking forward to this series and your perspective. Thank you for the free content Etho!"
0,"Most people: what is this messed up version
Etho: ahhh nostalgia"
0,Great episode!
0,When I started playing
0,anyone else remember the PC Gamer timed demo?
0,I miss that terrible looking cobblestone and those old sounds.😢
0,Grandchildren are so ungrateful.
0,Etho is the goat. It’s fun to watch these youngsters that missed the OG days. They’ll be doing the same for someone later.
0,"OK this was such a nostalgia tip, i could tell etho was enjoying himself a lot lol"
1,"Ohhhh yesss, I've been waiting for a Etho and Scott team up!"
0,28:10 I remember in old versions you had to build your fences on a block. Meaning you had to start from the top and remove and replace blocks downward. It was a unique buolding experience to say the least
0,Man this takes me back to me watching all Ethos RFW videos.. I'm 34 with 3 kids who love minecraft now
0,"if Etho doesn't win this series, i will commit a crime."
0,"This reminds me of Etho playing Sethbling's Death swap which was the first Etho video I ever watched, great video 💯"
0,I'm a bit sad Etho didn't throw his first diamond in lava. That would've been absolutely epic. <3 This is gonna be a great series! Also the Gem PVP was a nailbiter.
0,Ive watched every LIFE series and for some reason this video gave me more joy than almost any episode ever. <3
0,"Hey protop for versions pre 1.8 beta, 
You can farm a stack of wheat and get on demand bread with that if you have a crafting bench to save on inventory space."

0,Everything about this just feels correct. I personally have been watching etho since 2012 and this is so nostalgic
0,Shouldn't Grian be called Xelqua and be dressed in GREEN? 🤔
0,19:45 I ACTUALLY STARTED CACKLING OUT LOUD
1,"love etho's random team ups, so fresh"
0,"Etho, you should do a solo survival beta series. even if its short. I'd watch just for the nostolgia"
0,Gem bing Strong Sad is the best thing ever!
0,I hope Grian was furious watching Etho's diamond mining session
0,Just because Im filled to the brim with nostalgia and it was the most mind blowing thing I seen at the time. What are the odds of seeing a EATS road?
0,The only way this could be more 2012 YouTube meta is for it to be released uncut and unedited. Just a straight 2 hour video. Also it starts with the Skype call sound.
0,Why did ethos pov not change? I thought they were traveling time
0,EATS road when?
1,"im rooting for etho, jimmy and skizz to win!"
1,the fishing rod meta is going to go crazy!

0,its really funny how everyone is placing torches like light level 1 stop spawns lol
0,Introducing them to kamakaze creepers
0,I’m not seeing anyone mention this on any videos but everyone is complaining abt the wheat turning into dirt. It’s cause y’all keep walking over it and trampling the crops!
0,I can’t tell if Etho is being sarcastic about being in his late teens in 2011 😂

0,lol
0,Etho is in his element rn
0,We love etho slab
0,Dude this IS ETHOS series fkin amazing idea
3,I love how this is Trending on gaming and we have Etho in-between a bunch of other videos that have their thumbnails made to bring viewers in.  This episode is just such a blast from the past talking about the old boat mechanics and the other charm of Beta Minecraft (though one thing I never got is that Mojang years ago went back and changed old sounds such as doors and explosions (if you are wondering what they sounded like go watch Minecraft videos from 2011)). Though one of the best thing was the conversations with all the call back to those early Minecraft days brings back so many memories.
0,"As soon as I saw the premise for this season, I knew Etho would THRIVE."
18,God watching this brought up so many memories like how mossy cobblestone use to only be found in spawners so Etho dug it up
0,Etho was striving in this version
0,Etho will win this season
0,Etho 1.0: The Series is finally here
0,"Etho.. Feels like if you build wooden house, use the slab version since it wont get burned in old version and even when they changed into petrified slab."
0,The juxtaposition between Etho giving Scott lessons on Beta mechanics while casually finding diamonds to Joel and Jimmy screaming miserably through the cave slays me
0,Is this team B.E.G.S.?
0,I can’t wait for chocolate island
0,this is the minecraft of my memories omg
0,I play infdev 20100415😊 in the version I play in negative coordinates mobs spawn during the day and in the western coordinates their pathfinding is broken. However negative coordinates are north and west because the sun rises in the north and sets in the south. However..... Don't be out at night just saying. There are no caves and ores are much bigger like iron gold and diamonds. You can find a 23 vein of diamonds!!! I also found a 43 vein of iron a few times lol😅
1,everyone coming to Etho for advice is so wholesome
890,Gem's sick voice makes her sound soo sad and devastated talking about the saddle 33:10

1,If etho do not win this life series then he was always washed
0,13:01 Talk about foreshadowing! 😂
10,"The, ""God you are old"" kills me so damn much. Both because of how deadpan it is and how direct and funny it is, but also because it hurts me physically to my core, because I too am old."
0,"Coming from Grian’s video to yours, the ease with which you’re finding diamonds is hilarious! 😂"
0,3 mins in and Etho is already parkouring
0,LIFE SERIES SEASON SEVEN MANIFESTING AN ETHO WIN
0,Unc still got it❤‍🩹🌹🌹
0,Legitimately such a nostalgia trip watching this. Just needed a terrible mic and it would have been perfect.
0,When ethos goes “red stone! Mine!” It reminded me of his first episode of Minecrack when him and guude were helping bdouble0 build a mob spawner farm and he said “diamonds! Mine!” (I checked because I thought he said red stone not diamond
0,What a trip down Memory Ln.
0,Reminds me of ethos boat highways days
0,"What a nostalgia trip. Old Minecraft was a completely different game than it is now. It’s definitely been improved, but I think the old is fun and entertaining in ways that the current version can’t be."
0,etho you have no idea how much of a good idea you playing beta minecraft again is
0,"beta 1.3 was my start in MC so it's really nostalgic and special for me to watch Etho and gang play this :,)"

2,Oh man this is so great the discussion about the Minecart boosters at 42:00 I remember seeing a huge rail station YouTube video and that was what got me to finally buy the game to try and make my own - must've been around this version. The good old days!
0,"This makes me so happy. I started playing in Beta 1.3 and it's crazy how many of these janky old mechanics I remember. The mind of a mildly obsessed child is a steel trap, it seems."
0,9:51 Etho sounds sooo happy 😁 ❤
0,This was very refreshing to watch
0,Easily best Minecraft video I’ve watched in about 8 years
0,Chocolate island when?

0,This video made my back and knees hurt 🥲 pure nostalgia
0,"47:30 even the shadow of israphael reference, im crying..."
0,"I have a glitch I found playing multiplayer on my own server if you want to give it a try, it was really good for getting out of cave systems, if you mine into a wall and suffocate yourself with gravel, log out of the server and log back in, it would teleport you to the nearest above air block, I remember doing it in 1.7.3 beta all the way up to 1.2 release I wanna say, but I've never seen it anywhere else, makes me wonder if my server was just a lil bugged"
0,5:41 love that Etho still gets a thrill of finding iron early game 😁
0,He’s totally crafting a dozen mending + infinity bows when the time comes….
0,You gotta make an eats road at some point

1,"It's not that we need to rehash dynamics from previous seasons... but come ON. Etho is at his most Server Dad mode here, and he happens to group with BDubs and Scar. Which I guess would make Scott their new step-dad?"
59,"The juxtaposition between the new Minecrafters and the veterans is so amazing in this episode, idk why but the chat with martin was kinda surreal"
1,13:28 ETHO HOW OFTEN DID YOU GET TURNT BACK THEN!?
0,This is great!😄
29,"he was talking about a nostalgia trip, THIS IS A NOSTALGIA TRIP. And something Etho has taught me through my life is as long as you truly care about your passions, and you take care of yourself the best you can, those who are with you will find you. The start of this is a humorous full circle feeling for me being 23 now, and thank you Etho. For inspiring me and all of us! Beta was a lot of our starts because of you, and we enjoy it the same :D"
0,lol why does Gem sound so traumatized? Guess she’s the next vid I’ll watch!
0,"“I could have sworn these things were like hard to get in the past.”
Meanwhile, Grian"
0,Etho playing beta brought back memories I had long forgotten
0,"I didn't start watching until 1.7.9 which was about 2014, so I was 3 years late to the party."
25,"Oh my god the nostalgia blast back to the Chocolate Island days when I would watch after school 😭
Etho should for just a couple minutes talk super quietly and shy like he used to to really bring us all back haha"
3,Etho is in his element here
0,The life series has now seen chocolate island
0,Has to be my favorite Minecraft YouTube video I’ve seen in a while.
2,The poor developer who had to port voice chat to a ton of ancient minecraft versions that don't even have modloaders :(
12,everyone giving Etho their redstone is so sweet and funny 😭
0,"Man, this genuinely makes me wish that Etho played older versions more often, maybe with some of the other Hermits. Yeah its janky but there's a certain cozyness to it. I didn't realize how much I missed this..."
0,Really miss these times! The memories are flooding. I remember the first time I saw the E.A.T.S. And the mine cart booster I thought it was the coolest thing and incorporated them in all my worlds. Keep up the amazing work Etho! And let the memory of simpler time remind you that you don’t need to try too hard. Just enjoy the journey.
0,"Guys, Etho might actually win some PVP here. I'm so ready for the arrow spam"
8,Etho as the keeper of ancient knowledge was so funny.
0,"Hey Etho
It is you but without the squeaky chair and ASMR voice.
Love the well, just need to put a mushroom next to the well and it will be perfect.

Glad you are enjoying yourself."

0,Someone tell me this is the series where Etho wins
61,"This has been the sweetest POV i’ve watched T-T hes just like nostalgia-ing, and im nostalgia-ing right with him. This episode made me realize that Etho really HASNT changed that much since when i would watch him a long time ago, he’s always been so STEADILY “Etho,” one of the one things steady about my life tbh 😅 

I also love how everyone is like asking Etho how to play xD 

“This is your unwashed version,” a funny line but shockingly true xD Etho was never washed, minecraft just *un*washed 😭 The part where they were all gathered around being like “of course its etho who’s nerding out right now” omg that sent me xD Same with them talking like its 2011 xD


(Also, the second i saw etho run towards Joel i nearly shrieked, boat boys two electric boogaloo would be epic)

Etho is going to win this, and i am so excited."
0,"This is probably the best this version has ever looked in video. It's probably as good as playing the game in person a long time ago, although I have to think our screens have gotten better too."

2,"Watching this just takes me back to when I was 12 and watching legendary and canopy carnage, so good"
3,"Your perspective was so delightful. It was such a nice showing to the younger crowd of precisely how and why the bdubs, tangos and impulses of the world truly respect you so much."
1,YESSSSSS LIFE SERIES IS OUT
2,1:41 Joel is so obsessed with Etho he knows there has only been one intro ever since episode 81.

26,I really hope we get to see version 2.0(1.5.1April Fools Update). It'd be great to see the SLAB!
1,A real shame version expert @Zisteau isn't here to dominate the field

0,I could listen to Etho and Scott all day

0,this is so nostalgic and wholesome it’s crazy
2,"Oh wow! Gem sounds really sick. And she still recorded that day anyway! Normally I wouldn't say or notice, but this one actually made me hurt to hear. I was once sick in the throat and the sound making place. Felt bad!"

0,"I haven’t watched Etho in YEARS, what did I miss?"
0,Back when Evo was running someone who was watchinh built a redstone piston door in old Minecraft to show it could be done. Might be fun to show off an anachronistic technology.
0,"this bring back the memories, im a little bit dissapointed that ther is not the old satisfying door click"
4,"Etho, I would 100% watch a (probably relatively short) little like redo of old minecraft. Like what Zisteau tried doing for a bit, maybe? You seem to have a great time with the old mechanics and it's really fun to watch."
5,"I love how Etho spent the video being called old, and then talked to Martin about his time at Yogscast and the minecraft parodies he did back in the day. Really felt like rock meets stone."
1,ngl this was so very wholesome. why did i enjoy this lol
0,etho back in the beta like when I first watched is crazy
1,Immediately doing parkour lol :D
0,I think the farmland fence post trick only works when exposed to the sky.
1,Maybe this time Notch will fix his game...and really make the ethoslab of TNT?
0,When I found out about this series I had to watched ethos pov first for the nostalgia 💪😂
2,Skizz asking about the saplings then immediately clocking why was so good lol
0,"oh i have good memories with these versions :) so nice to revisit it. Wow, I have been playing this game for a long time, haven't I :D I know the game didn't have all the features but still it felt quite magical. (I played since beta 1.2) I remember watching Etho's videos, back then I didn't have a youtube account and I couldn't even speak/understand english (watched anyway and tried to imagine what you were saying). Your videos have been a great motivation for me to learn english, so thank you Etho for that :)"
4,I would honestly watch a whole series just in alpha/beta minecraft
0,You should try editing and styling each video as if you were making it at that time!

0,"Screw the Nether by InTheLittleWood is still the only song I ever bought on iTunes, and it was on my ipod touch back in 2012. This episode is a nostalgia trip."
0,Etho spouting off game facts and trivia like a machine!
0,"The perfect team of scammers. Scar (no explanation needed), bdubs steals and blames it on others, etho has a good redstone reputation so everyone just gifts him it, and Scott who is a social mastermind and always manages to be friends with everyone."
32,"The old man in his element. The throwback feels in the episode was so cool. And the throwback discussions with Martyn.
Excellent team up."
2,"Man, there was something so beautiful about older versions of Minecraft. It had more charm by how unrefined it was. There's been so many great additions since, but there is something lost with further refinement of the game."
4,"27:38 Knowing Scar is getting trapped in fences by Grian, is even funnier after seeing this moment 😂"
0,😭 2011

0,"40:30 I remember as a kid, because of Minecraft, buying sulphur from the gardening store and trying to ignite it... Didn't work very well 😂"
0,awesome timing lol I just finished Wild Life the other day
0,"1.2 beta is actually the version i started playing the game.  i remenber the ""castle"" i built in a server even. 1.3 beta is when they added beds, and i think repeaters were just added on that one."
379,"I am LOVING the Etho and Scott team up, they’re both so wholesome. The way Scott was cheering for Etho during his PVP fight against Gem and instantly defending him when Tango called him a liar in the chat and Etho giving him tips and asking Scott to save him when he was stuck in the fence was so sweet. Them along with Scar and Bdubs are gonna be such a fun team, I can’t wait till next session!"
1,this was my first minecraft version! :D
0,thanks for this! it's a bussy week and this really helps me calm down.
0,Old man etho hahahaha
0,"I started when beta came out, the game was good but I really didn't get completely stuck into the game till beta 1.3.1, stuck with the game through the Microsoft purchase but didn't stick around much after."
0,"So happy to see Etho teaming up with Scott!!! I was hoping for that this time around!!! 

After a day spent in hospital with my pops, this has made my evening."
489,"9:40 ""I'm actually loving this."" ""I've got a big grin on my face.""

Etho says as he cuts to mining redstone ore."
1,Been rewatching the LP from the start for a few weeks. Now I know why!
0,Beta 1.2 was my first MC version
1,Watching the grandfather of minecraft playing in his prime is so cathartic
0,"Looking forward to a minecart booster powered rollercoaster for the pure old school world experience.

Edit: And maybe a boat dispenser?"
0,"7:50 - ""Leather is Better [in this version]"" - We need a new ""And you've been Etho'd!"" now.  😅
I remember that in the early days. I always had leather armor, especially because diamonds were so rare!
36:00 - Even 15 years later I learn something new!"
0,Doop
1,9:06 Etho didn’t burn his first diamond😮
4,The references to 2011 are killing me because that’s the year I graduated. I especially loved Scar’s reference of Hot Tub Time Machine 😂
1,Just finished watching and  I'm with Etho on this one. Silly stupid grin through the entire episode. Too bad nobody slept because mobs could randomly spawn and kick you out of the bed. The old lava and cobble textures. Minecart boosters. You must rebuild General Spaz's tower! When did the unburnable slabs come into the game? I remember everyone on Mindcrack hoarding them when they changed from slabs to wood slabs (or whatever) then everybody coming together and rebuilding BDubs arena with them after lightning burned it down. That's what led to King of the Ladder on Mindcrack too. Total nostalgia trip.
0,It's Christmas already?!?!?!??
0,"O Watchers... please let this be Etho's season! 

We're on your side Ladders!"
0,Life was so simple back then....
0,Etho are you gonna chocolate island this map?
0,Oh boy this makes me feel so old it's giving me arthritis
0,"27:15 I love how whenever he is placing logs down, you can see him automatically trying to place it facing the correct way, when that doesn't matter in this version"
0,"The contrast between everyone else going ""This game sucked, wow"" and Etho living his best life (new series idea??? /jk) is great"
1,Etho didn't change Minecraft did. He was never washed just thrown in a different environment.
0,POV: Its 2011 and you're watching etho play Minecraft version 1.2 and you're dad hasnt started to beat you yet🤧🤧🤧
0,Smajor + Etho is an unexpected AMAZING treat
1,How are the data packs and proximity chat working what
2,"Etho was so in his element this episode lmao, he’s no longer washed!"
2,"32:28 ""God you are old"" Lmao"
0,29:20 that's just spawn protection
0,How will the version update work with the change of terrain generation? Will you reset the terrain or keep some chunks?
1,When worlds collide
0,swearing
73,43:29 the comedic timing of tango calling etho a liar in chat while etho says he hasn't found any redstone yet
0,I love that wherever he goes he collects red stone.
0,I’m surprised you didn’t get a nose bleed while entering Skizz’s house
1,Poor gem sounding like Lucille Ball
5,"Even Gems sick voice sounds like a 2011 Minecraft YouTuber

*cinema*"
0,u can make a moveing fan in beta
1,Team BEGS assembled
2,I love how Bdubs has his old skin again. In what version does Etho wish for big eye Bdubs?
3,The technical challenges of this series have to be insane. They have a voice mod on beta 1.2. They are going to have to upgrade the existing world with new features every episode. Very cool!
0,12:00
1,"1:40
""does your intro change since then"" is single handedly is most funny statement"
1,"Aaah, the memories from the MindCrack era flooded my mind"
1,The fighting each version should be gladiator rules where the champion has to fight in the next version.
0,Not familiar with the older versions but I wonder if multiple falling sand in the same block would make it look solid? They seem to snap up into the right position for a moment before falling again so maybe 5-10 sand would overlap enough to look solid!
0,"Hey etho I had a rough day, you made it better. Just wanted to drop some appreciation!"
0,Shadow of Israphel is a callback omg I was so mad they never finished it properly.
0,"I totally forgot that Martyn made Screw The Nether and How Do I Craft This Again?.. loved those songs, even if How Do I Craft This Again kind of became obsolete after the recipe book was added"
364,"Etho please blow their minds with “redstone transmutation” you can turn redstone into obsidian for the next few versions, 1.2-1.7, just put redstone where the block will form in a cobblestone generator, flowing water+flowing lava+redstone makes obsidian to build a portal with one lava bucket.  Will be legendary knowledge for all these new guys."
1,"Goodness, that's a blast from the past. Awesome as always!"
0,i love this dude
0,i love etho acting as an old wise wizard
0,"hm. I'm curious what value the gimmick this time around will bring. how does it cause chaos, or promote interaction? I guess time will tell."
0,WE LOVE TO SEE IT
0,"Man, this is the exact version I started in, and it's hitting me with some major nostalgia"
0,"Love it, I watched Etho from his first episode, and I'm currently playing 1.7.3 beta myself."
0,Anyone else get excited thinking Joel and etho would team up.  Then sad they didn’t.  Then excited again cause scar and etho?! I bet they will be great together! Cabin core!!
0,It would have been really funny if Etho had changed his skin to something ultra modern and made a new intro and wacky modern editing
2921,watching grian have the absolute worst time finding diamonds to the point where he loses his mind then moving to etho's pov where he and scott are tripping over them is priceless
0,"Etho, if your modded series is on indefinite hiatus, I think you would really enjoy Better Than Adventure as a modpack to play. It rolls back updates to pre-Adventure update and continues from that point on with the Beta/Alpha spirit of things."
1,do u update the same world or reset the world and just keep builds and stuff
0,"How cool is this!!! Love the nostalgia, when food didn't stack and we had no hunger bar"
1,Aww etho sounds so happy ! So animated! 💖
1,Gem sounds so destroyed 😭 I hope she's OK
2,27:34 this is a classic.
0,Etho needs to make that random tick tnt timer with the logs
0,"49:45 ""Be there or be square""

Well good sir"
0,cool
0,Willing it into existence: I hope they use the 404 seed before leaving beta.
0,Cmon Etho you have the advantage on this one!!!!
0,"I recently went back and watched your early play with minecraft.  It's amazing that you haven't forgotten any of it! I love seeing your intro every time, as well."
1,I was watching the old Zisteau OCD prank video and Pause and Beef were laughing about seeing Ethos' face while crouching and at 20:30 they're commenting on the same thing all these years later LOL
0,What a flashback! So much fun seeing you flex that old-school knowledge :D
0,"The creeper lore, the mob sorting system, the boats channels. Gosh, just the thought makes me smile"
0,Aww gem and etho are gonna save themselves for each other each episode ❤
1,"I'd give my left arm to be part of the life series, my gosh

anywho, let the fun of a new season begin! :D"
1,Genuinely feels like I've been transported back to episode 1 and we're all learning Minecraft again. Such a standout episode I love it
1,I forgot about Smallishbeans. I remember his sniping only road to commander on MW2.
0,"Oh man im really excited for this series, I wish all of the episodes were out already! Its crazy nostalgic hearing about beta minecraft, etho, and yogscast all in the first episode 😂"
0,"call etho washed up again, I dare you lol"
0,This makes me want a mini series where you play 1.1 again. Guess I'll just have to rewatch the lets play from the beginning
0,9:39 Same! the cobble texture!... feeling old but at some time worth it. This is version i decided to buy I think. anyone remember being able to play inside the web browser?
0,"Started a world in infdev last year, currently in preNether alpha. Funny hearing them complain about everything.😂"
0,This is gonna be amazing!
0,YOU DIDNT STRUGGLE FINDING DIAMONDS BACK IN THE DAY YOU BURNT THEM
1,Etho this is your season!! You're going to win!!!
0,Etho are you going to build a 360 cannon at some point
0,Hey etho i have some redstone for you
3,"Man, oh man.  I have a playlist of old Vechs maps played by Guude and BDouble00 from back in the day, and Etho joined them for some of them.  I may have to revisit them after this."
0,Bdubs using his old skin!! What a classic
0,Beta 1.2 !   Having started in 1.3 this is SO familiar... But no beds i guess
0,"Etho, your generosity is so wonderful! 🥹🥹🥹 Such a nice chap!"
0,Oh man i started back with Beta 1.2. Pretty sure my 1.2 world had a classic Etho underground mob farm with a mob-a-vator to bring them to the surface for dispatching. Man I'm old. =/
0,"So #PastLife is Minecraft's version of ""back in my day""?"
1,Etho is the master with the old versions.
1,Watching this in 480p for extra nostalgia
55,"20:34 So nostalgic 😭 I remember watching years back when etho said he'd do a face reveal and that was it, the skin without the layering for his ""real face"""
1,"32:34 ""god you are old"" — gem"
1,I never knew InTheLittleWood was Um_Bongo
0,this video was so nostalgic omg
0,=) delightful!  and the combo of the 4 of you is going to be so fun to watch
1,He mentioned Minecraft Monday! My fandoms are colliding!! >_<
0,After 10 minutes it hit me: Is there really a proximity chat mod for such an early version?
1,Smallishbeans is such a whining loser.
8,47:27 SHADOW OF ISRAPHEAL MENTIONED!!!!!
2,Gem voice is somewhat absolutly adorable
1,Haven't watched mc videos in years but all of a sudden I feel like a teenager again watching mindcrack. Its good to be back.
4,Brings me back to a simpler time.
1,I wanted Etho to throw some Diamonds in lava SO BAD :(
0,you've made my day
16,"I love this episode so much, it's taking me back to growing up with the lets play- and it's funny seeing Etho teaching everyone the ins and outs."
0,"I've been watching the let's play from the start for a couple of months now, so this has been great"
0,I love this team 🤣
0,"Etho was just like a camp director to everyone else, showing them all the quirks of beta. absolutely loved it"
1,Can we have a version of the intro with the mouth sound just for this series?
0,"Oh my god, Etho and Marty talking about early minecraft(yogscast) 😢😢 waves of nostalgia mam"
0,Who doesn't love a huge chest *badum tss*
1,"Minecraft wouldn't be Minecraft without Etho.
If they're using every version, does that mean including the April Fools ones as well?
If they are, then EthoSlab might even rear its head."
0,This is amazing. It's adorable watching Etho in his element.
0,The thing with the boat was awesome! If there was just some sort of Boat Dispenser...
0,Feels weird seeing Etho and BDubs together in 1.2 but no Guude.... OOGE!
0,The way you play this version of minecraft...
0,b1.7.3 or 1.0 next?
0,we need an EATS road!
15,Pre-washed Etho is terrifying
0,"oh man i still called sugar cane reeds for YEARS, i cant recall when i stopped actually XD"
2,Etho should've brought back the old headset and mic
0,LIKE WE NEVER LEFT
1,9:54 Is hilarious after watching Grian's perspective where he's just struggling for 40 minutes to find a single diamond
0,Etho: I used to rule the world... Chunks would load when I gave the word...
0,"Etho please consider a Beta series. There are a hoard of Beta 1.7.3 purists plus all of us....and see if you can talk BDubs and Doc into it, too. Pretty please."
0,It’s so uncanny hearing all the modern sound effects mixed in with old ones
0,I'm more amazed that the proximity voice mod is working for Beta 1.2
0,Etho is in his element. Just like the good old days of the LP.
0,"I wonder if Etho looked some info up, or if he just legit remembers all this. ""Traps"" and creepers being weird is a memory, but pork giving 4 hearts? How would one remember that?"
0,"I started playing Minecraft in either 2010 or 2011, I recall it was before the full release. Looking back, sure there's a lot of features people enjoy now that make the game easier to play...but is that necessarily a good thing? I feel that perhaps the quality of life has gone too far over the years. It isn't much of a game anymore. You were constantly being challenged back then. Nothing soul crushingly difficult or anything of course, but still challenged.  
Just some  thoughts, nothing more."
0,GET YOUR SNACKS!!
0,To be in this series with OGs like Etho and Bdubs would be an absolute dream come true 🙌🏽
1,I was never here for the uhc era but god this reminds me of the etho uhc era
1,"Man this is such an amazing nostalgia blast. Takes me back to the good old days when times were simpler, thanks for this!"
1,I think you guys have found all of the diamonds on the server! :D Grian found just a handful of them! :D
15,"4 bros sitting in a hot tub, 1 block apart cuz they’re not gay… er.. well minus Scott. 
I love old Minecraft!!! This is so fun!!"
1,Winners POV
1,"Damn, even back in beta you were a glitch ninja."
1,I think I've already seen this hahahaha
1,1 HOUR?!)! im getting my snacks!!
2,The way you can feel his happiness with the nostalgia ❤😂
8,I miss Mindcrack
1,I'm getting my snacks together cause today is a good day!!!!! (Etho uploaded)
2,The reveal at the end was so good
1,1:57 IT GOES phOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1,:0 shadow of iserfell mentioned
1,"So much nostalgia watching this, think i might rewatch the lp from the beginning again"
1,Kinda disappointed that Etho didn't throw his first diamond in lava 😂
1,imagine hermitcraft season but on this version of game
5,Pro-tip: set the video quality to 360 p or lower to make it feel even more nostalgic
1,"Lets go to a place, where everything is made of blocks <3"
1,I think we have a frontrunner for 1st place here!
2,New life series!!!!!
1,That brings back memories ! I did also start on this version ! Which had harder mobs then the actual one in my opinion...I remember having really back luck with diamonds too
2,"if *anyone* deserves to win Past Life, it's Etho. All of my eggs are in the Etho basket."
1,Anyone else getting mindcrack king of the boat flashbacks??
1,Yayayayayayay!
1,I like how Etho went back to his old skin for this series.
1,"""Oh humble master of the arcane knowledge"" 😂😂😂"
2,Omg I am on vacation and a new Life Series starts and Ethos is in it. Blessed!
8,"""will i die?""
""no you will be fine""
>SolidarityGaming died"
2008,Wait until everyone remembers that enchanting originally required 50 levels
1,"If i'm not mistaken crops needed ""sunlight"" so they couldn't be enclosed. My guess why Tango's farm wouldn't work."
1,"Yeah, Etho definitely will win this life series."
38,"The whole episode is basically just Etho being a grandpa and showing the new kids his old tricks, lol"
8,"Etho, you should build a creeper face somewhere"
1,Etho finally has the advantage in this series
6,Seeing Etho mess around in Beta Minecraft tastes like pure Dopamine. This was delicious!
1,Etho and bdubs were at home in this episode!
1,If you want an authentic experience you'd watch this in 244p lmao
1,"Oh! The end where they're talking about arson, I hope someone crafts some of the old non-flammable oak slabs at some point in the series."
3,It's really strange hearing high quality mics and high energy voices with old minecraft graphics.
1,"“Huh, 36 notifications, guess I didn’t check my YouTube for a while. … oh, that’s why!”"
1,"washed? nah, still in the shower! wiping the floor with gem"
1,Anyone else wondering what the version gaps between episodes are going to be? Like are we going to be in 1.8 survival update next time or will they stick with beta for one more?
1,Ethos at home in this version lol
1,Etho in his element :)
1,Bdubs and Etho are the most iconic Minecraft duo of all time.
2,1 word: memories
1,Grian did this series before
1,"11:35 WAHH!
You just turned black!


Ummm...."
2,36:22 Bdubs: “we are one”
1,i’m already loving the manly cabin bros
1,Awww shii here we go again
1,I just realized that Etho teamed up with almost the same exact people as when he was in MCC for the first time. Hbomb was with them instead of Bdubs.
7,Nostalgia punch to the face. Remember Etho and Docm as my earliest Youtube experiences. Such good times
3,"Minecraft Legend, all versions"
1,lmao this is etho in his element
0,Love the team this time around!
1,20:37 Etho forehead reveal lol

1,Immediately thought of spaz when that first creeper exploded 😂
1,OG players collect the mossyy!
1,Absolutely fantastic
1,Who are these people?
1,I love seeing him back in the classic environment.
1,Etho is THRIVING and I spent the whole video smiling so much my face hurt
1,Yall making me feel old
1,So many things I need Etho to build in this version. Where is the boat road???
2,Why can't it be modded
7,Return of the EATS road. Eventually
1,Etho bestowing the ancient wisdom to the newbies.
1,Peak is truly returning
1,In my day I couldn't sprint...😅
1,Yay ethor
2,Atleast etho isn’t washed up anymore now that he’s in his prime!
1,Is this eats road time? You should make one
1,I hope they dont change version too quickly
1,WOOHOOOOO
1,Etho excitement for the nostalgia is amazing😂
2,Beta 1.2_02 is like everyones first version
2,Staunch Etho fan here and I'm having high hopes since we have homecourt advantage rn :3
4,you can tell etho is having so much fun playing in this version and showing everyone how to actually play and do some weird fun stuff
1,I hate people who keep saying I hate
1,mate wtf small beans he was that cod montage bloke
1,Nice to see Etho and Scar allies for once. Great start!
1,5:12
1,"Etho always seems to have a bit of a trickster in him, but the opportunity to be silly here is amazing."
1,"Woo! Let's go! Another Etho vid to binge watch on repeat! ❤

When Etho was showing around their builds to Gem, why am I getting little Etho being proud for the builds and showing it to a master /teacher vibes? So proud of you ❤"
1,i'm biased but this is definitely the best perspective to watch this season
5,Etho and Scott stole all of Grians diamonds lol
1,"Aaah. Back when Minecraft was just growing into becoming Minecraft. Plants were still nice and neat in a row and there was the beauty of palette swapping one texture to make so many things. The beauty of that ingenuity and simplicity is long since lost.
Sure it's less harsh on the eyes these days, but that was more down to palette than textures. And I still think it looks like a bug with the plants not aligned to the blocks.
Anyway, so happy to see Etho getting to relive the glory days. You shone bright then and you still do. That's why everyone has such respect for you. You've earned it by hard work and a humble attitude. This is your time to gloat and show those youngsters how it used to be! ;-)"
7,i love everyone’s reaction to the stairs in the hot bar
1,He's not washed up!!!
2,48:03 Martyn did screw the nether??
1,<3
2,I think my inner monologue might be stuck in the early 2010’s
1,36:40 etho vs gem ❤
1,It is wonderful hearing the smile in your voice! ❤
1,"We are so, unbelievably, back"
7,"i love how happy etho is it’s just pure joy for him in past life

also watching this vid immediately after grian’s where he has a breakdown in the mines bc he can’t find diamonds is SO hilarious"
1,This is one of these videos that make me wish I could give more thumbs up.
1,the episode we didnt know we needed
1,Best  1 hr of my week
1,"Ohhh I liking this team up, this was very enjoyable!"
5,"I think etho should make a Herobrine shrine randomly and say nothing about it, set traps and do the whole forest thing tunnels and restone torches"
1,Start a beta series etho
1,Pearl the Goth Muscle Mommy was not on my bingo card.  She went back to 2011 with her fashion :D
1,You've never teamed with Scott or Scar before!!! Looking foward to see what the Cabin Boys get up to!
1,The nosetalgia is real.
3,"oh my goodness, etho and beta in 2025"
8,"Perhaps my favourite and most nostalgic part of old minecraft like this is the lighting, night time always just looks so pretty to me!"
1,I reener being a child watching the early days of the first season of the lets play. All the old jank that never works well brings a nostalgic tear to my eye. I missed this
3,Gems sad sick voice 🥺
3,what a throwback episode with such great Minecrafters
1,"4 guys chilling in a bathtub, 5 feet apart."
1,"Etho the intro is iconic and timeless, don't listen to the little anklebiter. He's only jealous because he spends 10 hours producing bespoke musical intros for his hermitcraft videos."
213,"The reason their farmland keeps resetting is because they don’t have crops planted. Empty farmland resets if it’s walked on, even with a fence"
1,11:32 Why did my boy react so loud to that 💀
1,"I recently started watching your lets play series from the start, and now this..."
195,"This might be my first ever YouTube comment in 15 years, but as a long time subscriber I had to say that the nostalgia was off the charts and I loved seeing everyone learn about old school Minecraft! 

Now Etho needs to round up some of the newer Minecrafters and show them what a Super Hostile CTM was like in the beta days 

Thanks for all the amazing content over the years Etho!"
1,The title and thumbnail made me think of the movie for some reason before I even processed the intro
1,2:25 anyone else mishear that? just me?
1,Everyone who called Etho washed in the last 5 years is eating their words now!
2,Man this video was beast!
1,It's funny how etho just educates the hermits 😂 he's the master
1,This is such a fun one!
1,LETS GUARRRRR
1,YESSS
1,He still remembers everything lol
2,You were defintey having fun!!!!!!  Great video.
0,"Omg, please trap Scar in some doors"
8,Etho take advantage of old minecarft CRAFT THAT A GOD APPLE!!!!!!!
0,"Once upon a time, gapples were craftable... just a reminder 😂"
0,"Ah the yogscast, That's how I found Minecraft. Yogscast didn't age terribly well they were at each others throats. I found Hermit craft a few years afterwards mid season 6"
0,Wonder if Etho would ever do a Better Than Adventure playthrough..
0,Taking a moment to watch Form This Way because it's been a while.
0,My god gem's voice jumpscared me lol
35,"Etho + Scar + Scott team up! This one’s gonna be a lot of fun, and maybe we’ll get an Etho win.

Obviously Bdubs as well, but Etho has teamed with him a couple times already."
0,Wait where's LDShadowLady?
0,Do you still have the same tissue box from this version?
0,team BEGS
0,I absolutely love this. Watching modern Etho play old Minecraft is such a treat!
1,Why does Gem sound like Jennifer Lawrance?
0,Hope etho creates door/pressure plate traps to catch some creepers!
0,"This is a huge nostalgia rush! I started watching you at the beginning of the “Chocolate Island” series, and I still watch everything you publish! 2011-2025 and still going strong! 😁"
0,"I'm enjoying this a lot. Not as much as you Etho, but still. I can't stop smiling.
Edit:
And of course yours is the first video I'm watching."
0,How many episodes until the triumphant return of our old friend the EATS road?
0,This would be the perfect season for an etho victory
0,"Man, Etho will be in his element here. Go Etho go!"
0,You really need an ugly brick thing in your base.
1,brings me back to when i first discovered the Mindcrack gang- Etho playing canopy carnage!
0,"etho playing beta minecraft? what a blast from the past... as in i decided to rewatch the entirety of the chocolate island lets play like half a year ago and then some CTM and OOGE, have not taken on the daunting task of rewatching s2 though"
0,Oh I am so glad this is happening. I’ve been practically praying Etho would play old Minecraft.
916,"scott teaming up with etho... not only have i wanted this since secret life but this is a GOOD OMEN. an etho win is upon us, i can smell it."
1,I wish he did a singleplayer series in old Minecraft. No offense but can't stand the commentary style of most of the Hermitcraft people.
0,Etho is thriving i love this lol
0,I love how happy etho is through all of this
0,"There's diorite, andesite and granite."
0,"18:30 I think you live, I'm not sure but you can try it

12,45:22 I love how everyone breaks the sugar cane.
0,Wow this bring me back. Didn't expect to feel this old today.
0,Why is scar floating 😭😭😭
0,Can’t wait to see the shenanigans Etho gets up to (eventually) with his growing collection of redstone
0,21:40 for some reason THIS moment right here was the nostalgia wave for me.  The way the item he's holding on the mouse cursor *sometimes* goes in front of other items on the invenstory grid and *sometimes* goes behind it just....  The absolute *example* of the kind of jank that makes this version of minceraft so special.
0,We gotta protect the clay blocks
0,this finna be the best etho series just coz its his entire career compressed into a social server thingy
0,Omg
1,"As an idea, beta 1.3 introduced wooden slabs iirc, (the fireproof ones) so you could upgrade the cabin to be fire proof!"
1,THE BOATS
0,Hopefully they never run out of ideas this series is always so wonderful
1,I had the biggest grin on my face the whole video. This is great stuff.
0,Commenting for the algorithm

so yeah it's not mobs being glitchy it's just you cant hit their feet"
1,"I was at the grocery store last night and I passed the chip aisle. I kid you not, I stopped to get a bag of takis, the chips I was eating in my earliest memories of etho videos. Said to myself ""I shall save these till etho uploads again"". What a good morning"

0,He's in his natural habitat now
1,If Etho doesn't win this! I will sue!!
0,woo!
9,11:20 The reason diamonds are so much easier to find in older versions is because in 1.18 they were made to not spawn as much in open air caves. At least thats just my theory

0,<3
0,No deaths and 1 kill on episode one? Looking good for the win!

2,2:26 what did skiz said he did what to the keeper 😮

2372,I think the timer is to prevent people from making them on site to help with building then killing them afterward.  Basically using them like disposable build aids instead of pets.
0,I’m convinced you and Blockchain Backer are the same guy.  2 of my favorite YouTube channels.
0,Please show the End sorting system in action! I love watching that thing work!!!!
0,Never lose hope in God and always know that He is by your side amen❤
0,could y maybe update the world folder please. I wanna built the egg room
0,Hey Etho. Do you avoid rain because it affects the bitrate quality of your video? Just wondering. Thanks
0,im the new subscriber bro ill react to your lets play minecraft ❤
0,Is this all survival or creative was used ?
0,"Hey Etho,what's your criteria for picking comment of the day?"
0,Whenever Etho says AHA! it tickles something in my brain
0,Etho for your next mod pack playthrough you should try TerraFirmaGreg. It just got a huge update that I think you would enjoy. Keep up the great videos!
0,"Hey, I was wondering if you explored the pale garden and tinkered with the creaking heart at all. It apparently gives redstone signals based off the distance of the mob it spawns when a player damages it. I'm just curious about what you'd do with them... also resin's pretty neat."
0,"Hey Etho, random question. Why don't you make Posts on your YouTube channel for updates? I know you've used X/Twitter for a long time, but Posts would more directly reach your audience when something's up that's preventing content or if you have a question for us. Perhaps not necessary - but I'm curious!

Love your content. You inspired me to get ""serious"" about playing Minecraft in 2014 and I'll be forever thankful :)"
0,Wow.  First time back to one of your videos in years.  I'm shocked you're still in the same world lol.  That's crazy.  I would have absolutely had to start a new one at some point.  ADHD would have gotten the better of me.
0,Comment History Test
0,"Hey Etho, I haven't played Minecraft in years, and I've only recently begun to learn about what has been released since then.
I've noticed that with recent updates and game drops, you focus on what specifically interests you, but don't acknowledge other features that have been added.
Not that you have to use things from new updates when they are added, but could you at least note things that you know a new version has added, even if you don't plan on checking it out right away?"
0,Bro I use to watch your stuff daily and waiting by the computer 10 years ago. It's good to see you're still around and doing well. Cheers to many more years bro. Thanks for everything ❤
2,"Hey etho, I noticed that you are still walking up a netherrack staircase when putting gold into your piglin bartering system. Have you ever wanted to go through and polish up that project along with others to make it easier to interact with on a player side?"
0,I can imagine you could use the happy ghasts as attack ships against each other!
0,"Etho would you consider playing Vintage Story, as its basically terraforma craft as its own game?"
0,7 MORE EPISODES AND A NEW WORLD TOUR SHOULD BE OUT!! Cannot wait for it hopefully you still do one every 50 episodes
0,How ghastly!
0,"I get the impression that a lot of the issues encountered in this episode is just client sided physics. e.g. the reason slime block launchers don't work well with boats is that when you are driving the boat, the boat's physics are entirely client-sided, while the slime block is on the server side. This does not happen for minecarts since you do not control them the same way.

I find it really disappointing how getting inside a boat that is leashed to a happy ghast results in the boat just dropping down. The player, and vehicles they are controlling, just completely ignore being leashed apparently."
0,Hydraulically reanimated.
1,i wonder if etho still has the cache of bows with both infinity and mending when it was possible because i wonder if he could use those old bows to fly while leading the happyghasts instead of rockets
0,"Etho, you should play with the distant horizons mod."
0,I like the fog. gives the game atmosphere. like the old legacy versions of the game.
0,Hey Etho! Something I’m wondering about your world is where are your earliest pets. Do you still have your first horse for example? Do you have a favorite pet / captured mob?
0,Can they be sped up by a speed potion? if so maybe a bundle with Speed 2 splash pots could be a viable transport method.
0,"Minecraft: adds new mob to the game
Etho: Okay but how does this relate to parkour"
1,"Etho, kindly asking where is the past life episode of yours?"
2,"Dear, Etho. I think it's time, dude. You've talked about it before. But I think it's really time now. Your world is too big. The mega projects are just machines that get you to another big machine, but you aren't really doing a lot with the materials. Some terraforming. Some Mancave touchups. And everything is so spread out and largely unused...or broken, or you can't remember how to use it...or why. It's time to let it go, man. Time for a fresh start. In my humble opinion. Play well! P.S. the egg chamber was the best thing you've ever done in this world.  I hope you felt like it was time and resources well-spent."
1,One of the things i miss the most is the old dwarfs vs mobs games i would love to see those come back lol I love you videos have been watching them since i was little! you are the best i love seeing you still post minecraft on the same world i would watch when i was young :)
0,I'm wondering about punch bows. Perhaps it could be the new punch bow + elytra combo
0,I love that I got your channel in the divorce. 💕💕💕
0,Love you!
0,i love how etho immediately does a bunch of little experiments with the dried ghasts i never would have thought of
0,when are you gonna make a new world Etho? 🌎
1,10:49 I think this feature is there to alert players that they’re nearby in Soul Sand Valleys. Pretty smart tbh.
0,My nephew came over and hopped on the PS and loaded up Minecraft. Made me think back when I used to watch etho all the time. Decided to see if he still makes videos and here I am. I remember when he built the potion room. I was like 12 years old when I first found him and I’m 26 now 😭😂 nostalgic asf.
3,"This will probably be lost in the comments, but I'll type it out anyways... I've been watching your videos for years now. I must have been in middle school - now I'm finishing my master's in biology. I find myself coming back every so often and bingeing a series and its so relaxing; similar to re-watching an old childhood cartoon. Thank you for continuing this journey and entertaining us all through our lives as a constant source of joy and calmness. <3"
0,"As far as rain goes, it should be possible to use a charm on a beacon to either stop rain completely, or even make it rain constantly, and maybe even make it so it can be doubled to super dry the local area to turn grass into sand, or make thunderstorms constant"
0,"i'm so happy all the hermitcraft people are using the retro ghast textures, sometimes what seems best on paper isn't what's actually best in reality"
0,"Hey Etho! For the next world tour, would you be willing to install Distant Horizons so that we can see the world in a whole new way? I think that it would be pretty cool!"
0,Bad cop from the lego movie makes an apearance in this etho-sode
0,"Hi Etho! I really love your videos, they always make me laugh.

I have a question for you, or for anyone who wants to answer. I’m wanting to be a gaming YouTuber as well and I was wondering if you have any tips? Or how you even record your videos in the first place 😅? I’m new to using laptops and computers and stuff

Please and thank you, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day 😊"
0,"Can’t help but always come check on my boy etho. Always a great feeling seeing the content still coming, and still having the same love you always have for the game. Have been watching sense I was a kid now I’m a father of two. Truly grateful to have grown up watching someone as genuine as you. Hope you are doing well buddy"
2,"Ive been watching this series since highschool, 12 years later and i still get excited!! 😂"
0,"Etho, have you seen the Minecraft movie? What did you think?"
0,maybe wind charge off of the ghast and fishing rod them up?
0,Etho! What do you think about Copper Golems and the Happy Ghast? They really brought more life to the base. It feels like Minecraft is starting to focus on adding mobs and tools that make our bases feel more alive—just like you mentioned in the Imp & Skizz podcast before. Also i am following you since the beginning of chocolate island my fav YouTuber (:
0,Let play's new seri: TerrafirmaCraft: Hardrock😢
0,Never feed them Fire Charges after Midnight!😂
0,this guys a legend
0,Can’t wait to see etho work with copper golems when they come out!
0,Etho would you consider doing another terraria playthrough. Its been almost 10 years and we miss it!
0,Yes
0,he likes parkour now? gosh he’s sooooooo obsessed with Joel 🤭😆
0,"the soul speed sorting is such a wonderful concept, but also hilarious because it is so immensely niche"
0,"The timer for the ghast is long, but if you’ve ever seen ark survival evolved, most Dino’s take that time and bigger ones take hours. 

 I think it’s an interesting mechanic to Minecraft. We’ve never had to wait for so long for something. Maybe in the future there will be new “crafting tables” that will have the same patience/wait mechanic. After all there is more and more metal work to be done now copper is in."
0,Yes
0,"PARKOUR ARC ETHO, ID NEVER THOUGHT ID SEE THE DAY"
0,"Hey etho there is someone else that has the exact same name well kind of he's name is ""ethobot"" can you talk about ethobot?"
0,"Common usage post-aestivation seem to be awake, emerge, arouse from..."
0,Etho with 7 more episodes left are you dreading filming the next world tour?
0,Can you build something specific in redstone for me
0,"I just want to say thank you for still playing and making videos, i literally grew up on your amazing personality. Just wanted to say i appreciate everything you’ve done even when i don’t watch for a while, your always the guy i come back to when i need. Love you man"
0,31:30 does powdered snow make wind charges shoot out of dispensers perfectly straight like it does for dropping blocks? Or does it block the wind charge?
0,I love your videos Etho I have been watching them ever since I was 5 You are awesome
1,"Wow what an amazing episode, this one was so fun and playful I barely realized the video was over 30 minutes long by the end of it time flew by, and speaking of time flying by, an episode like this is especially nostalgic, because I'm going away to a summer camp today in pennsylvania called camp woodward, and I remember when I was a camper there when I was 13 or 14 around 2013 watching an episode in the man cave where you were working on building the school in the underground village for the villagers, and now today, 12+ years later I'm watching an episode from the same series before I leave to go back to that same camp now as apart of there staff. Crazy how cyclical life can be sometimes. Great episode! Can't wait to continue seeing more, and now this is a good excuse to build a floating base somewhere in your world, kind of like the floating snowflake you already have! As an Idea!"
1,Can you please please give world download of your current world. I just want that dragon tunnel one. The dragon display! Please sir
0,"I think it is an excellent timer for redstone tbh. Minecraft is a game where you rarely just do a single thing for 20 minutes so I don't really mind the wait. I assume the easiest thing will be to have one or a few happy ghasts at each general area where you are building. It is an excellent addition for building, which used to be a pain for bigger structures that require a lot of sneak walking and scaffolding and as a mob it is super charming. I wouldn't mind the ability to speed it up a bit. Maybe feed it a something to get a 10 minute 50-100% speed boost. Still not fast, but convenient for bigger building projects.

Mojang should tweak the movement speed of minecarts, horses etc ^^ I wouldn't mind a more expensive rail that allows a much greater movement speed either."
0,9:58 i appreciate the ur ghast
1,Brother Etho I’ve been watching your series since I was 13 and I just turned 27 on Monday you’ve now been a part of more than half of my life. Thank you 🙏🏼
0,"What can ""grow"" within a cycle of the dried ghast timer?"
0,"Etho, I know you have mentioned game dev and other programming concepts before, so I was wondering if you are/were a developer of any sort? If so, what languages do you know well or prefer? Any cool projects you have worked on?"
0,"One of my favourite videos you've made in months, probably in this whole year! I love the messing around episodes where we just see you explore the intricacies of new stuff, it's so great to see your unique brain working like that! As well as seeing your process at the end as well"
0,"I want more boring stuff etho, i want the supid contraptions and building"
0,I hope he learns to inv jam
0,I love rain
0,"You should attach several ghasts in succession with leads, confine them to a space and the player has to get across the space on the ghasts heads. They would randomly fly around in a train."
0,Do potions affect them?
0,Etho teaching me new words about animals! Estivation: prolonged torpor or dormancy of an animal during a hot or dry period.
0,How can normal Ghasts not become dried out in the Nether where there's no water??? 😆
0,How crazy would it be if they added a gatling gun to this game
0,"As a kid I really wanted to ride the Ghasts, 14 years later not only did they add it but made them useful and cute. Best update ever."
0,Warms my heart that you’re still playing and doing this series. I was a young boy when I first started watching your content and now I’m a grown ass man haha. Keep it up mate!
0,5:36 You can make engine sounds lol
0,Happy ghast is the reason to make another farm...
0,That soul speed boot invention is insanely high IQ
0,"Etho, how do you decide on colour/block pallettes for your builds? I have ALOT of trouble figuring out which blocks I should use, and get unmotivated. I love your block choices! and would love to know your though process!"
1,"man what happend to minecraft, this is so cringe :("
0,Speed potion ????
1,"Hey Etho, I wanted to thank you. About a year ago you read a comment of the day regarding Vintage Story. That same evening I purchased the game. I've been addicted ever since. Thank you so much for reading that comment of the day."
0,How about speed pots for moving them?
0,33:44 etho casually stretching a string and some slime 10 or more times its length in a fraction of a second while complaining that it is to weak
0,"I think the timer for rehydrating them would have been more interesting if they only rehydrated in the rain, instead of in water, and rehydrated in like 2-3 minutes of rain tops. It feels a little more thematic and would be a little random, rather than a hard 20 minutes."
0,"Definitely some cool parkour ideas here, excited to see what else people do with these happy lil ghasts"
0,Yer hilarious! Absorbing the joy. :)
0,How can you not love an Etho happy ghast vid? Right?
0,the ghasts could be used as a gondola if theyre leaded to a mob in a minecart
0,18:39 the name of your pickaxe reminds me of one of the bosses from terraria
8,"This is why I love Etho, he never takes anything at face value. Like, minecraft gave us this mob to : sit on it, fly around with it, and build stuff easier.

What Etho does with it before all of that : Parkour course, sound effects, redstone clock"
0,20 minutes is ok. Gives a sense of achievement and gets away from instant gratification. Games should have more things like that to work towards.
0,is this their april fools snapshot?
0,I like the timer. I think the time requirement keeps you engaged with the game (IMO).
0,Seeing the “have you ever built a redstone contraption then realized you made it too complicated” comment knowing he was about to turn around to wilson was some crazy nostalgia
0,Always love these videos where you mess around with new features
0,"I'm pretty sure the dried ghast and how it rehydrates is based on a real life type of bacteria called Tardigrade. So to answer your question, personally I would call it rehydration. I think estavation or hibernation implies that it's a deliberate behavior, so in my opinion that doesnt apply."
0,They should add a snowball-fishing rod to speed them up same way you speed up pigs or striders
0,We got etho edging dried ghosts before gta 6
0,"Hey Etho, 

What do your statistics look like in the world? It would be interesting to see after so long
Surely you're holding some records in there!"
0,Thank you for being the greatest Minecraft YouTuber ever Etho. Keep it up.
1,"""Happy ghasts"" are gay af. Dumbest idea Mojang has had since phantoms and nerfing mendfinity bows"
0,^
0,ooh ooh oh oh oh what about happy ghast minecart railcannon for speedy travel
0,"Maybe with these ghasts, etho will finally finish his rooves and cielings"
0,"The only thing I dislike about happy ghasts is that you use water to revive a creature that's native to the nether, where water can't even exist."
0,"Q: How long will it take for Etho to game-ify these--
Etho: Yes.
😂❤

Also, I didn't see one named Bdubs' Mom!

Thanks for the video Etho! ❤"
0,"You know what you could do to transport them faster, you could get a riptide trident and fly with them. The distance you can get is not bad and with rain you can go infinite."
0,shouldnt cut it out of the video because its funny
0,I wish I made more time to be a loyal viewer and comment on every episode. 😢
0,mama etho *insert maid outfit*
0,"Etho maybe i wasn't fully paying attention, but have you tried fishing rods?"
0,Are there cargo harnesses for the ghast? If so a baggage train seems possible.
1,You can use wind charges + fishing rod to boost off the ghast then bring it up to you
0,I think something with happy ghasts might be a good strategy in the upcoming life series
0,Have you ever considered if the path you chose to walk through life was best? I constantly have doubts about doing the things I do. Just curious
1,Happy Canada Day Etho!
1,"This was actually my first time hearing about aestivation, and it sent me down a bit of an info rabbit hole. I started wondering if there was a term for it when it’s not seasonally triggered. Turns out, when it's brought on by extreme heat rather than seasonal cycles, it's called facultative aestivation.

From there, I got curious about whether there's a more general term that isn't tied to specific conditions or seasons—and that led me to torpor. When torpor is triggered by environmental conditions, it’s called facultative torpor, and when it's part of a seasonal cycle, it’s known as obligate torpor.

What makes the Happy Ghast unique is that its dormant state doesn’t end just because the environment changes—it also needs to be rehydrated. That makes it much more similar to the dormant state of tardigrades (aka water bears), called cryptobiosis. In this state, they lose nearly all their body water (down to about 1%), their metabolism nearly stops, and they can survive that way for years or even decades—only returning to life when rehydrated.

Basically, Happy Ghast are just super-sized, floating water bears."
0,10:48 nice hot coals sound for saunas and such
0,"Huh, were there parkour jumps you could only make using momentum from a previous jump before? That's quite cool, but I didn't know it."
0,"Its so good for building! Like suddenly you can go creative mode and look from higher up at your builds and build towers and stuff, i love it."
0,They're going to be really good for detailing large structures and sheer faces
0,19:34 😬 strange design etho
0,I love your Ghast names 😭
0,Etho can you just showcase real quick some spots with vibrant visuals on!
0,Etho please upload more ;(
0,"Hey Etho! Long time fan here I really miss your montages! 
Like the hopper, hopper, dropper, dropper, rofflecopter! 
And never think the episode is too long! I will watch it no matter how long it is! 🤩"
0,"I’m curious about your thoughts on where Datapacks fall in the Vanilla/Not Vanilla debate these days? Are you a hard no or a soft yes/no?

Reason being: you recently talked about recipes you would like to see Mojang add, and some of those can be added with a simple recipe (Stonecutter to turn Stone or Deepslate into their cobbled variety, for example)"
0,You could say the dried ghasts have become re-invigorated once they're fully hydrated.
0,I wish they'd have made a possibility to convert Ghast in the overworld with snowballs (or something else)   instead of watering a dried ghast (another new block).  Forcing players to do the achievement of bringing ghast to the overworld.   That tamagochi thing might be appealing to the young though.
2,I think the fact you can craft & farm dried ghasts and grow as many dried ghasts into ghastlings as you want at once is worth the timer tradeoff
0,'Rejuvenated' might be the word you're looking for.
0,can you use speed splashpotions on the happy ghasts or on mobs you want to transport while flying?
0,"Etho, would you and the hermits ever consider doing a UHC? Not sure how it would work with how many updates have come out since the old uhc days and not even sure if you guys have the rights to the game mode, but I think it would make for such a fun series again"
0,Etho liking parkour? We are 100% in the recession
1,I wonder what an Etho Satisfactory world would look like
0,parkour?! have u seen parkour civilization?
0,"Early to mid game the Happy Ghast is really opening up overland travel -- my favorite ""mode"" of play right now is to not build a single base, but rather float from town to town levelling up cartographers and raiding Trial Chambers."
0,Etho you should make a moving platform game on Hermitcraft 👌🏻
0,Etho getting super into parkour makes me really excited to see him return to MCC sometime
0,Im curious if the lead also breaks if you already fired the rocket and the lead mid flight. Or how enderpearls or chorus fruit interacts with the new lead system.
0,Frogger 2 Ghaster
0,2:40 ya need gold to watch the dance
0,Another Etho episode lets go this world is amazing we need another tour please
0,After all these years and I still love watching Etho experiment with new features
0,"""20 minutes is too long to wait""
Valheim: <sweats nervously>"
0,"""We don't do a lot of upside down building"" Was it every really viable before? Of course you don't do it when it sucks to do."
0,The  proper term for coming out of Estivation is Emiliosation...
0,you can lead them AFTER you use a rocket and the lead wont break
0,I just time travelled into the past watching that intro omg
0,"Does anyone know what “deferred render distance” is referring to in the new update? I don’t know what “deferred” means in this context, is that different from classic render distance? I tried looking it up but I couldn’t find anything. It has been a little while so maybe someone’s posted an explanation by now."
0,I wonder if slow fall potions affect the happy ghasts in any significant way. Would be cool if you could hit them with a speed potion and a slow fall potion
0,name one of them appa
0,"I know its a random LP ep but thank you Etho, you bring so much joy to my life and the world. whenever i see you upload a strange sense of calm comes over me and i know that for about half an hour ill be happy. thank you Etho."
0,Ergo please play Vintage Story ❤
0,"Wow, Wilson was a crazy pull. This update was 100% inspired by Etho."
0,You should turn the broken/inefficient slime farm of the man cave to a rare mob merry go round
0,"from what i have noticed in my world, im pretty sure the boats and ghasts getting no height from the slime block launch is number of entities loaded based"
0,Final form: Mama Etho
0,I think the timer is not that big of a deal. Were so caught up with instant gratification that it kind of forces you to step back and be patient. You could set them up near another project you'd be working on and the time would pass the same. I mean think back to when minecraft first came out with how long it took to mine and build things
0,"Hey Zenith, you should ask Etoh to free you from your windows logo prison for the world tour @ 600."
0,Sadly I can only play on my phone and the new update over heats it. So can’t play Minecraft anymore… with they would make it so we can turn off all the new features that’s causing the overheating.
0,"I’m so glad Etho is still having such a successful YouTube career and that these Let’s Plays are still garnishing as many views as they are. I recall avidly watching him in my late teen years, I’m in my mid twenties now, and seeing these uploads always gives me a raging nostalgia and a familiar comfort that I find rarely in my days."
0,"Is it ""ethos lab"" Or 

""Etho slab"""
0,"Did you just casually parkour that? It was also super cool to see you doing experiments on the new features. I miss those. You just have this ""investigator"" air that makes it feel like we are learning secrets. Which is usually true because you tend to use them for unexpected mechanics. I still recall the boat-powered BUD switch.

Thanks for including the launcher outtake, I didn't actually know how to optimize those and I'd rather use a more efficient one even if it is larger. And again it is interesting to see you test these. The whole fun of the game is seeing what odd challenge you can do, so even the armor sorter is valid from that perspective.

I love the noisemakers as well, but in world it's a little dark... ""Oops, no water, better luck next time.""

I am still not sure how I actually feel about the ghasts. They are nice for building, but we already have unhappy ghasts and it doesn't feel like it fits the game, even if it does actually solve a long-unmet need. In hindsight it is weird that building in survival is all-around better but you can't get under a build or place a truly floating block..."
0,I hate the fog so much
0,"Etho, I was just watching BDubs new vid and had an idea. What if you used the happy ghasts to make a ball game,? Can you hit back ghast fires on the new ghast?"
0,Can you use a splash potion of swiftness on them so they are faster?
0,"Great episode, loving the dried ghasts as parkour it's a good idea, and the happy ghasts are so cute, loved all the little names haha. Keep up the great work Etho."
1,19:07 erm Etho??? whats that pattern with the dispensers??
1,You need to show more of your redstone experiments! they are fascinating. just do them quickly if you think people arent interested. They were the best part of this video
1,I wish they would add a magic Whistle (item) of sorts that you could associate with a peaceful mob and it would call them to your position.
4,Dried ghast would make a good cooked squid item. Imagine you have a campfire with a dried ghast on top as if you are grilling it.  They also would make great heads to place on dummies.
0,"these cubes look so bad to me

Especially so many"
0,Love your videos Etho. Watching you learn the new mechanics is very fascinating
0,"As someone who’s nickname is Marshmello

I am honored to be in the thumbnail of this video"
0,Etho saying that parkour is fun wasnt on my 2025 bingo card.
1,Oh yeah the great one continues I got my snacks tuna tacos
0,7:30 sounds like a pretty good and compact randomizer!
0,I think they would be great for building in the end.
0,Effo
4,Etho making various little contraptions to get different sequences of the dried ghast hydration sound is so joyful. Keep on being full of whimsy my guy
1,"etho, you didn't test them with speed potions"
0,"it's so much fun to watch your test and play with new mechanics in the game! you always manage to explore/examine things from angles that i would've never thought of myself, and it's so fun to see your other interests bleed into it as well, like now with parkour. the joy and playfulness of it all is very infectious :D
it was also really cool to get a look into your creative test world at the end, to see how your brainstorm, develop, and troubleshoot ideas!"
1,"my plan is to hydrate one in the end, after killing the dragon, to do that initial exploration for end cities.  none of the stress and hassle of bridging over the void and end islands, just float around until you find a few elytra."
1,Shade E E’s Happy Gast Dealership on the Hermitcraft server?
0,Cool
0,It made me so happy he kept nearly calling the area at the guardian farm chocolate island :3
0,Etho totally experimenting on baby ghasts 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0,"hello etho! i noticed you've been talking about good game design a lot recently, have you taken up game development? i know in you said in the past that you know how to code from when you used to ""hack"" games. me personally, i'd love to see what an etho designed game would look like."
3,"""i'm determined to find something stupid we can do"" HERE WE GO BABY THATS MY JAM"
0,I’d love to see another level of frogger in the future using the ghasts in the minecarts. It’d be like the moving logs in the river sections
0,"Towers are cool when they have a functional reason for existing! Think of all the iconic mob grinder towers in various worlds.
That said, a ghast raiser probably wouldn't get enough use to justify itself..."
0,"Etho, can you throw a haste potion at ghast to get zoomies?"
0,"Hey Etho :) Im happy that you read your comments, it makes us viewers feel seen.
I think i found a way to make horse and ghast a great combination, you can leash them together in both directions with too leashes. This way they both get dragged behind if you ride the other.
Donkeys seem to have the perfect speed for the leashes not to break. Storage and faster travel, but still nothing OP yet."
0,"The soul speed boots contraption is actually very interesting, I think you should share these more often even if you don’t use it. 
Could be useful for some people."
0,"Happy ghasts return to their spawn location when they're not near a player. Building a platform at world height and spawning them there, then using an elytra and a lead to pull them to where you need to go, might be a way to transport them pretty easily."

0,I think the 20 min timer is completely fine. The game should not be balanced around players who did everything they could and coming back only to try some new features. Normal player can do something else while raising the thing on the background.

Ohhh, so that's how you get dried ghasts. So I can get them in my current world, using my stash of gold. They'll be good for looting forest mansions, since the issue there is getting more loot than you can carry. But a ghast caravan carrying chest boats relieves the inventory crunch.

Do speed potions work on the ghasts? 🤔"

1,"Etho, I love your curiosity and experimental approach to minecraft. You are a true scientist in this virtual reality. 
If the ghasts have a much larger mass than the player, then it makes sense that slimes and sticky pistons wouldn't move them as far. The same force applied to a player causes less acceleration to a ghast of higher mass. 
This is not how minecraft physics work, just a random thought watching your videos. I agree the ghasts should be more compatible with the other mechanics. I think you're a one of a kind minecrafter and your ideas have a direct impact on the game."
1,"Etho, here's a fun idea: Would you consider doing occasional LP episodes where you work on your Chocolate Island world? You'd keep it in Beta 1.7.3 of course so things dont break, but just do an episode for that world whenever you have an idea for a build that works in that version. I think it would be fun to see that world continue, even if it isn't the primary focus."

0,Can you use speed splash pots on the happy ghast?
131,"When sea monkeys are dehydrated and then brought back to life by adding water, the process is called ""cryptobiosis."" Specifically, sea monkeys (brine shrimp) enter a state of ""anhydrobiosis,"" a type of cryptobiosis where they lose almost all their water content and enter a dormant state. In this state, their metabolism virtually stops, allowing them to survive extreme conditions like dehydration. When water is reintroduced, they rehydrate and resume normal biological functions, effectively ""coming back to life.""

A cryptobiosis state and an anhydrobiosis state could be accurate terminology to use for Happy Ghasts."

Lately I’ve been watching some of your older Team Canada series, like *Labyrinth of Puzzles!* and Sky Factory 2.5, and I would love to try out my editing skills and craft a few compilation videos from these series. Not just editing down each episode, but trying to show little narrative arcs across multiple episodes in a fun way, for example. I don’t want to rob you of any ad revenue from people watching your videos, but I assume your older series don’t get too many views these days? (Couldn’t figure out how to say that without sounding rude, I’m sorry.)"

Surely, they can be to slow for most exploration, but if you can lead them in horses and boats, they can be helpful, especially in more vertical terrain.
But they might be amazing for doing big, tall or floating builds, especially combined with scafolding, slime blocks and honey blocks among other building tools."

1,"I'd love if you'd be able to make air balloons with them, small ones and probably rather niche  but would still be fun to have a small little platform you could use to move several animals on at a time and maybe a double chest or 2 on it.  I want to see more transportation methods in general even if they only have niche use-cases.. I don't like how elytra ruined creativity  for that as you have to make a choice of not using them at all if you want more fun creative ways in your world.

I'm a bit surprised you didn't do more train shenanigans with them given that you usually go for trains in every modded series you do, hooking the leaded ones up to ghasts in carts, maybe have animals attached to the ones trailing after and so on.
Keep being awesome and I'll see you in the next one!"

0,"My niche complaint for the ghast is how it was included in piglin bartering. There's a niche nether only playstyle that I really enjoy, but it's very tightly tied to the bartering system. The dried ghast is essentially a non-item in bartering without access to water. Wish you could break them for ghast tears. Very niche, but that's what stood out to me."
1,"I had to pause the video to comment on this. I know youtubers, and a good number of non-youtubers too, NEVER want it to rain in their worlds and loathe the change to the rain timer... but as someone who hates Phantoms and loves atmosphere, I ALWAYS hated that sleeping through nights meant I never got to see rain ever. I sincerely hope they come up with some other method of making rain stop, or preventing it, that _isn't_ just sleeping. Maybe sleeping with a new potion effect resets the timer? Altering weather DOES seem like the domain of magic. You could rig your bed with redstone to automatically splash potion you whenever you lay down to sleep, or maybe they could add that potion effect to beacons and have a general no-rain zone around your base."

1,"I HATE the drop system.

Why does the patch version number bump for updates that add FEATURES, it should be the minir version that bumps, while patches should be for just bug fixes and patches.

Also feel much less hyped for releases since they add so little and since snapshots are so mainstream now, mostly everything is already known and spoiled. there's no mystery.

Back in the day, you had secrets, little Easter eggs and such to discover, find, share with other players. Nowadays, everything is overdesigned to ""perfection"" in the eyes of Mojang, use them as designed.

Back in the day we could invent curious little unintended behaviors with the new blocks they gave us. New blocks and mobs lack depth or complexity.

I miss the golden days."
2,“I’m determined to find something stupid we can do” YES that’s our etho
0,I wonder if a happy Ghast lift in your base would make a good decorative feature?|
0,"Happy ghasts as far as I know have their ""center"" at the bottom of their hitbox, same as almost all other entities, with exceptions being things like paintings, item frames, shulkers if they are extended down and for some reason wind charges. I would assume that the reason why wind charges didn't launch them a lot was that they try to pathfind to a specific position and as soon as they cross that height, they try to go down with their own ai which massively slows them down. And when you are sitting on them, it's interaction between server and client that's not working properly."
0,"Hey Etho, have you tried using TNT cannons to launch the Happy Ghasts? They seem to affect alll mobs the same way, unlike the wind charges, so maybe you'll have more luck with them? Kepp posting amazing vids, I've always believed you're one the of technical Minecraft GOATs."

0,Not Etho edging the dried ghasts 😂
0,"I love the way you experiment with new features when they're released. You can get a small vertical boost on the ghast by hooking it with a fishing rod, jumping, and reeling it in midair. Not sure how practical it is, but it may be worth a look."
0,Maybe with the punch bow you can fly these things around faster?
0,"Thew dried ghast timer is interesting. It's a fixed 250 second timer that only starts with a random tick. Once that timer is over, the block advances to the next (or previous) stage or spawns the ghastling mob. If there's ever a need for ""I need at least 4 minutes, but random and it should be around roughly 5 minutes"", this is it. :)"

0,"Interesting, the happy ghast's very boat-like slime block interaction and being an entity that can take multiple passengers makes me wonder if maybe the happy ghast's code is a highly modified boat"
0,"commenting on the small rain rant at around 17:00, i personally think it was a positive change.
rain was too uncommon before they made sleeping not reset the timer, i understand it's horrible for content creation due to bitrate and similar issues, but i think this way is unfortunately better for most players. (myself included. i love rain. rain vibes so cozy so comfy)

however, i think mojang could easily create a ""best of both worlds"" scenario by just letting players sleep away rain as well. we can already sleep to skip thunderstorms, what's stopping us from sleeping in rain? plus, rain lowers the sky light level, so it's technically a hazard similar to night. even ignoring the content creator woes, i think it'd be positive to allow skipping it overall."
1,I'm so thankful! I get so happy adding an Etho video to my watchlist. 😊

9,"One thing I really like about them is that they feel like a midpoint/smoothing-of-the-ramp between pre-end city travel and Elytras. Like, before this it was ""You are totally earthbound, oh you beat the ender dragon? Now you can fly anywhere forever!"" Now you get to the nether and you get _some_ aerial travel. It's slow and niche but it's a nice smooth curve to reach the unbound freedom of the elytra"

0,Pretty Gassy episode 👌
1,"Making a separate comment here. If this gets selected for comment of the day!

0,"etho, instead of hating the rain; embrace the rain! i suggest wearing gold boots when it rains cause they look like those yellow rain boots that way it feels more special 😊 maybe even name them the new puddle stompers lol"

As always love the videos, thanks!"
0,"The 20 min isn’t really much of a blockade for the ghast to be honest, if you need them for building just set them up before you get to the underside of a build right? Like if you are working on a floating island set them up in some water and by the time you are done with the top of the island your ghast will long have rehydrated"

0,"I don't think the idea of trying to take care of the dried ghast is a good idea solely for the reason that there is no immediate feedback (or even just knowledge) of that mechanic's function. You could argue interacting them with items is a form of feedback, but it would be unclear what item would have to be interacted with in order for it to work."

0,Have you tried using a fishing rod on the ghasts to pull them up?
0,"with the 20 minute timer, I think the timer makes the ghasts feel less replaceable. like ""Oh, don't worry I've got tonnes of them on me RIGHT NOW, in my enderchest."""
0,"I would probably call a happy ghast 'hatching' as rejuvenation. Meaning to revert to a youthful state, which I think is appropriate for what's happening to the poor guys."
0,33:16 i would have like to seen how you separated them. i made my own and it took weeks to figure out. also its very big and requires arrows to work :/ (this is before the Allay)
0,I can't believe I've been watching etho for 13 years. Insane. TV shows can't hold my attention for that long
1,"sounds like happy ghasts sounds are derived from cat noises, just like normal ghasts."
0,"It's kinda refreshing to see you try and engineer out solutions and understand how mob mechanics work without checking all the patch notes and keeping up with the ""tech demo"" type videos that explain everything. 
An example I wanted to point out is how the Ghast AI works when you are on top of its solid head and when you lead it. Their movement AI changes so that it's a reliable platform that you can jump around on. That's what's messing with your project to drag ghasts perpetually upwards. Maybe try something with fishing rods and leads to freeze their AI to pull them with another entity?

IIRC, the leads breaking is based on velocity at the end of its range. So, if you're walking and a lead on a boat is stuck on a block, it can actually stay connected for a long distance and increase tension to have a sling effect."
0,21:00 could test a slime piston wind charge launcher or water stream to condence them into a a space if they don't interact off one another that way can focus the muddle of ghast to see if works that way ( would semi be like an end pearl launcher in concept just with multiple wind charges for the slime piston one if they don't get activated from the collision )
8,It's wild to come back to this series after taking like a 10 year break from Minecraft content and seeing parts of the base are still the same. It makes it feel so easy to jump back in after all this time.

0,Surprised Etho didn't immediately think to see if speed potions worked on them for flying

0,I think fog is just there to give an illusion of smoooooth gameplay
0,"Can't you just use the ghast to fly up, then hop off an lead them with an elytra?"
0,"Hey Etho
Was waiting for you to do this episode and it was as wonderful as I thought it would be. I have always enjoyed watching you have fun with the new updates. Now for the Redstone flying machine question. Is there away to make a flying machine with a fireworks dispenser attached to it? I really would love to use such a machine in a fireworks display. Skizzlecraft Halloween roller-coaster upgrade is still coming along slowing but I am working on a 4th of July fireworks display."
1,15:35 dude i remember you making several floating islands way back when on modded mc. Jet packs were what gave you the idea i think and it turned out it was still a struggle?
0,I think etho has been playing since alpha 1.1.0?
0,Can they survive in the end thougg
0,"Hey Etho! long time follower, since the old chocolate island , tnt firework show days! My birthday is in less than one hour and seeing you posted a new episode is a perfect surprise! Thank you so much for over a decade of entertainment, fun, and shenanigans."
0,I think it called arousal or possibly awakening when they come out of aestivation (estivation for Americans.) Pretty cool stuff! Some animals (and even some plants) do some pretty amazing things.
0,Etho loving parkour is breaking news!
0,"Thank you for the video, Etho!"
0,Entertaining video as always.
0,"I find it ironic how you have an insane ghast tear farm on hermitcraft which sponsored X's entire ""ghast-lighting"" prank, yet apparently have no such thing on your own survival forever world so that you had to rely on bartering to get what you needed, haha

Also I think it was X who just said that people have been trying to figure out how your brain works for the last 15 years, and this episode was a hilariously timed example.  Yeah, that new mob that we can fly on and build with?  Listen to these crazy sounds they make when we hydrate them in succession!  Let's see if we can turn him into a clock!  Is ghast parkour more difficult?  How about the parkour challenges we can make after they're full grown and rolling around in minecarts?  Can I land on one with a horse, lead him, and then jump up and drag him into the upper atmosphere?   Can I use windcharges to launch him into space?

You may call this a ""goof around episode"", but I think these are the best ones, haha 🤣"
0,"etho, did you watch the minecraft movie? What did you think? -JL"
0,My brother and I grew up watching your videos and still talk about you often. This is awesome
1,Im glad you showed your soul speed boots sorter. I would have never thought about armor stands moving faster on soul sand with them and using that as a way of sorting - I think it is neat
2,"Ethos happy ghast names-

Soarin
Marshmello
Little Dude
Ariella (my best guess on spelling)
Puffball
I am Cow
Ur-Ghast
Somebody I Used To Know
Aether
Tranquil
Atmocube"
1,A good solution to the speed thing is to simply add the ability to enchant the saddle (could be cool a function to do to the existing addles as well)
0,ETHO YOU CAN'T MAKE THE JUMP PAD THAT SHAPE
1,definitely the weirdest minecraft update to me
0,"I don't care for the new fog effect. Maybe it'll grow on me with time, but it just makes me feel like my screen is dirty."
0,One great advantage of rain; it heals your Happy Ghast
0,That fog is disgusting.
3,Thank you ethoslab. Today is my grandmothers birthday (may she RiP) and just had to bury my grandfather last week. You bring not only joy to me but also some sanity to my life. Thank you for taking your time out of your day to record and talk for us. You are the best
0,7:42 Etho Mom arc
0,"OOOOH, I just had a great idea with the bubble column and happy ghast: proper elevators! Since you can stand on the happy ghast, you could hide a bubble column in a corner of an elevator shaft and use the happy ghast as a platform to stand on, moved up and down by the bubble column and restrained by blocks. It might be a great way to revamp some of the old broken elevators in your world (like the slime block horse elevator), and they might even be good for vertically moving mobs that way."
0,"Hey Etho, does this update mean we'll now get a log section in Ravager Rush, now that it would likely be doable with these happy ghasts?"
0,Ghast Elavator
0,I’m wondering if he tried doing the air boost jumps holding the snowballs
0,Ur-Ghast is a great pull for a name
0,"The release schedule isn't fast, you're just _that_ slow my guy."
0,hey etho just wanted to say that i have had a very rough day (flight got delayed then cancelled) so this video is perfect timing. thank you for being in my life for almost a decade now and consistently cheering me up.
0,27:20 Etho has some good constructive criticism at about here.
0,"The goof around episode feels _SO_ classic Etho, I love it! More episodes like this interspersed with the usual would be great."
0,"A few things you could try, if you haven't already:
- Flying and hitting yourself with a punch bow (if that still works) instead of using rockets
- Flying in the rain with a riptide trident
- Some sort of TNT launcher for you and the ghast? (if it's possible to minimize damage to the ghast)"
1,"Etho, the timing on this was pretty crazy. I haven't played minecraft in months, and today my sister and I played for the first time together in a while. We found dried ghasts in the nether, and the moment we hydrated them you posted this video! I was amazed at the timing :D"
0,"the fact I'm 23 watching a new upload from you, i remember when i was 16 watching your vids daily truly apart of my gaming childhood is crazy, mind blowing. i thank you for always keeping my mind off of the real world . thank you etho<3"
0,"Okay, you should make a parkour training course in your world, maybe with some fun redstone components! I think it would be super fun for people to play around with in world downloads, and might be a really fun and unique project for you to work on."
0,I kind of wish that the Ghasts didn’t decline in their dried forms. Having the different textures feels like it would be great for building
0,"Just out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on the Minecraft movie? Especially now that its influence has leaked into the game itself with Lava Chicken. I'm personally torn between being disappointed that brainrot culture so successfully intermingled with the Minecraft community, and not really caring about people goofing off and having their fun."
0,"You know, I know you've already addressed this before but will you ever consider starting a new world? I mean this one is fantastic and nostalgic and has an almost legendary status, but I feel like the game has become so different now from when it started and all of the old builds and nostalgia are almost like a burden? Like, I'm curious to see what a fully new start Etho LP world would look like."
0,Wait is ur-ghast an mtg reference?
0,Wait! The boot sorting was so smart and cool!!! I would totally build that in my world!
0,Camels should have been like three double chest of inventory
0,"Etho's LP update episodes when its like he's playing around with a new toy are so important to me, I love these episodes"
0,Im not a fan of the fog
0,The fog makes it look like bedrock edition
1,Etho panning to Wilson when asked about over-complicating a redstone project sent me.
0,"Etho ya okay man? Parkour   <3R? Pretty sure I've watched all of your episodes since chocolate island ep 11, and you have never said that hahaha! My second question for COTD {comment of the day} is as follows: are you continuing of your dad's green house?  (forgot what you said to tag at the end of the library episode for the first COTD) I hope you are. Thank you kindly for everything"
0,YES AETHER SHOUT OUT PLEASE INCLUDE IT IN YOUR MODDED SERIES I BEG OF YOUUUUUUU
1,this episode made me realise that Etho is actually so good at parkour
1,"4:30 Etho, please tell me you have seen Parkour Civilization. That would just be too dang funny."
0,There are elytra for flying fast. Ghasts seem perfect for floating which hasn't really been possible before.
0,you never go horse to ghast
0,"I may be leaving this comment prematurely, but what about slow fall and jump boost on the horse while you're on it and on the ghast?"
6,8:11 i can't believe i learned a new English vocabulary from ETHO'S minecraft lets play video
0,Regarding the 20 minute timer I instantly thought of Rhyniognatha cravings in Ark where you increase the taming bonus by feeding ‘rare’ items. The same could be applied here with some hard to find/craft items.
0,"You should've said ""I'm gonna be a dad"" lol"
0,"I wonder if the old punch bow elytra method works with the leads, could be a kinda cool way to bring back an older mechanic like that"
0,"It would honestly be less annoying if it were longer. 20 minutes is just short enough that you can't leave it and do something else. They should make it longer, and make the ghast invulnerable and immobile until it sees a player the first time so you don't have to worry about it disappearing. Set it and forget it. Also make it track its starting tick so you can leave the chunks and still have it progress."
0,use the air elevator on the side of a steep cliff no?
1,Etho Happy Clock
0,I wonder how effective fly up high on the ghasts and then towing them while gliding with elytra would be.
0,"With how much work is put into the baby ghast AI I'd like if you could make them stay as a baby! The speed being a little slower than sprinting (much slower than sprint jumping) is quite upsetting as well, they should get a sprint option like camels do! It's a bit annoying how they can clearly fly several times faster when they're not being ridden (even when carrying something heavy)"
0,"I love how when the update came out, people were crying about how sad and cute they looked (wiped their tears as they farm villagers), but etho's first thought was to jump on them"
0,16:35 heck yes art deco
0,I want a permanent baby ghast
0,"16:12 Acceleration to a maximum speed would be nice for the happy ghast.
Move at pace when in transit long-distance, but move finely when building."
0,TENNISSS!!!
0,Nether portals to move happy ghast up? Can it fly through a portal like a boat?
1,"Etho, 
I noticed the towers looked similar to the travel tubes from Futurama. I wonder how quick you could travel using the wind charges and blue ice surrounded by glass or glass panes."
0,"For the last mace and ghast combo you tried, maybe attempt to hit it from the side so you dont go far enough to break the lead?"
82,"Seriously, it's crazy how innovative Etho gets with problem solving in this game, like I've never seen ANYTHING even resembling his boots sorting system at 32:06 and it's just a ""uh, why bother"" project for him. I really like when he shows these, because I feel like a lot of people can get inspired from these, and maybe use these sorts of mechanics in the design for some other creative thing!"
5,24:15 he says sorry to the horse but not to the stepping and experimenting done on the baby ghast... interesting... noted
0,a spitty ghast setup with ghasts being dragged around like balloons could be really fun. I wonder if they're attached to a mob in a minecart that is bounced by a piston if they disconnect the lead
0,"The takeaway from this episode, for me, is that wind charges need buffing to greater utility."
0,Ghast torture device😂
0,"I think the mob is stupid, the end."
0,"i love the faster updates, purely because they force etho to put out a goofaround LP episode. the more etho videos we get, the better!"
0,"Love how he ""voices concern"" about the 20 minutes dry ghast thing, cause he should definitely then try ark 🤣"
0,omg it looks like old console minecraft
1,Stunningly good feature out of nowhere that’s great
0,"Dont think of it as just ""for underside building"" think of it as ""An Mobile Infinite Scaffolding"" that DOES NOT require additional ""supports"" every like 6-7 blocks. 

Plus, its a legit, all be it insanely slow, 100% reliable way of transporting mobs around your world thanks to the new lead mechanics. Gone are the days of trial and error trying to transport mobs via elytra and lead, sure once you figured it out or pillared high enough to glide home it was super fast but never reliable... now we have reliability with the Happy Ghast at the cost of speed... personally id love to see them move faster by default but when leads are attached they slow down to the crawl they are now. Maybe like basic sprinting speed without jump spam... mediocre donkey/horse speed, heck id settle for saddled pig speed or strider speed, i think those two are even faster than the Happy Ghast."
0,I'm not a fan of the happy ghast. It's the first time Minecraft released an update i genuinely dislike. Have there been any updates you genuinely disliked?
0,"i like the idea of having to take care of them during the 20 minute timer. to expand on that if you dont provide the care they want they shouldnt just go back a stage but instead grow up to be a normal, angry ghast lol. like uhoh you were a bad parent and now your child is running amok"
0,I wonder what it would like to use a tnt launcher while riding the happy ghast
0,Minecraft Happy Ghast Kaizo parkour.
0,Hey etho maybe I misunderstood the videos I watcehd but to my understanding the dried ghasts have an exact tick time between changes. The video I saw said exactly 5 minutes between them making a perfect clock for long term things. Could you try looking into this aspect of the dried ghast to see how it helps with your Redstone builds?
0,33:12 33:20
0,"25:20 ok Etho, time to rebuild ravager rush with proper Log platforms now."
0,Any special plans for episode 600? New world tour?
0,I stopped watching a while ago he seems more confident and animated now still good tho just was a shock lol
0,"Kinda wish Etho played more games besides Minecraft, maybe some Factorio or a reboot of Terraria is EZ. 
Seeing that I haven't liked the direction Minecraft has been going, bit Etho is still one of the first and favourite youtubers I watched."
1,"Hi Etho, hope this reaches you well. I've been watching your videos for nearly 14 years, a majority of my life, and I cannot describe how big of an inspiration you've been. I'm in my late 20's now and beginning a career as a university lecturer teaching game design and 3D modelling. I don't think I would be here without your videos and I just wanted to say how awesome that is. I hope I can be as much of an inspiration to my students as you've been to me.


Also, do you still hate onions? I still hate onions."
0,"i always love a ""tinkering with new features"" episode! you always think of things that i would never have come up with."
0,How do ghasts keep momentum in minecarts? Remember those spinning tnt minecart loops from the life series? That ghast would be a fast moving platform if it keeps momentum in a cart
0,"Cubfan135 found something very interesting about the Happy Ghast while using one to detail his bases wall on the HC server.
Get this... While building off their back, changing things out, some blocks fell on /very close to the Happy Ghast but ""too far away"" from Cub to be picked up... then he mounted up again and BLAM all those nearby items got vacuumed up as if Cubs pickup radius was 4x as large... VERY interesting mechanic, no clue how it would be useful outside of its obviously intended purpose of building... but i know someone will find some interesting way to utilize that mechanic."
0,"I'm thinking maybe something can be done with attaching to a parrot on your shoulder, but I forgot the conditions for them to stay on you..."
0,name one bdubs mom
0,Horse + happy ghast is a really cool combo. You get the speed of the horse and if there's a river or something you can bring the horse on the ghast to get over
0,Frogger season 3 with ghast moving platforms maybe???
0,5:09 oh damn he really has been liking parkour!!
0,"I don't think it makes sense to use shears to remove leads, like why can't you just remove it by hand?? Or is it only when connecting to ghosts?"
0,"Etho this makes me wonder an important question, what is your updated opinions on onions? I recall you hated them in Cube World, what about now?

It’s been so long that I hated them back then too, now I can’t get enough of them lol. I put them on most meats and salads."
0,"Etho, you forgot about how saddles are craftable now. For literal years a point was made that they wouldn't be, but Mojang changed their minds. Also I was really hoping dried ghasts wouldn't be craftable originally. Knowing you need things from the Nether to make one though has made me decide it's fine. You should try to seek out a real one eventually though, just for fun."
0,I love how much fun you had in this episode. I haven’t heard you this excited for years. Just having fun goofing off is why I fell in love with this channel years ago.
1,The rapid updates are fun unless you play on a large server and have to wait for Paper and the admin tools to update.
0,"I know you have talked about liking platformers before, but you really enjoying parkour in Minecraft is not something I expected.

I shouldn't be surprised because you also spent years and years conditioning yourself to become a better builder, and look at you now!"
0,Hey etho why dont u use the gamerule or commands for the rain? It doesnt really affect gameplay and spending your time waiting out of principle seems wasteful
0,Etho loving parkour sounds so weird
0,"Do potions work on them? Like a speed potion, for example"
1,Ayyy Ur-Ghast callback.
0,Etho... happiness takes time.
0,"The whole ghast thing is neat and all, but i feel like a lot of the changes made with their release is another example of mojang making changes to the game in the sense of ""How you Should play"". Instead of ""How you can play"""
0,"Most players: Can't wait to fly around on these things!

Etho: yea so the baby actually has a really interesting hitbox, could have some useful applications...

Anyway since you asked I think the happy ghasts are baffling from a lore perspective, but it's neat that you can build upside down more easily now."
0,"""Im mama now"" kkkkk"
1,Hide and seek is a lot harder now.
0,=)
0,"I kept hearing “Happy Gas” until you went for the Ghast Tears, then it clicked. 

We pronounce Ghast differently in Aus which I already knew but it just didn’t register haha."
0,"Etho, would you ever build your own parkour course?"
0,wait im confused why cant you play in the rain?
0,"Etho. Have you heard that Thaumcraft 7 is in development, and a teaser trailer came out ~1 month ago. I havent been excited for modded minecraft in a while, but i am now."
0,i feel like the nerfing of the leads with rockets and wind charges will have so many negative side effects to moving mobs… but maybe that new ghast lead thing will cancel it out?
0,"I named mine, Gaston!"
0,Do armor stands work on happy ghasts? 🤔
2,"Volume is cranked, snacks are acquired, Fullscreen headphones, lets go!
Edit 1- Oh man the nether base! Its been a while but I really do like this base. I couldn't even tell you why, its just really nice. 
E2- Ha! Soaren, LOL thats great. Wonder if he will see that."
1,canadian man tortures babies 2025 (not clickbait)
0,"Have you tried out Vintage Story? I think you what it is, but if you don't, basically Terra Firma Craft as its own game. Ask Gem all about it."
0,"Etho, you’re the best channel on YouTube in my eyes, and have been one of my favorite sources of entertainment for a large part of my life. Hope you are doing well and had a good time making this video :)"
7,"I love a goof around episode from Etho, but then I love most of Ethos episodes 😅"
0,the original pokemon games were just mazes with extra steps.
0,What would happen of you launched a minecart while the ghast is inside?
0,"Oohh, I think your idea with the ghast interactive would be cool! It makes me think of Tamagotchis, but instead of getting a bad tama, it just loses its progress. Maybe if you take better care of it, it will fly faster and if you ignore it, it will refuse to move ahahaha!"
0,etho the armor stand sorter is a 10/10 i would have loved to see it in earlier videos
0,"Etho, would love to see you build one of the new ender pearl stases chambers by squibble that allows you to teleport on command."
0,"Absolutely hate the new fog. 
Everything just looks dull and unsaturated.
And it just made the rain even worse, it was already annoying enough before but now you can see anything either..."
0,i don't know why it absolutely kills me that you can just craft the dry ghasts 😭 going out collecting the tears of their dead foremothers and making a dry little baby from it to raise and love. i love minecraft
1,"5:57 ive watched 5 minutes of etjo torturing orphans because he likes the sound they make when he almost ends their suffering, you okay bro?"
1,"Now, I'm a straight man with a wife. However Etho beats the ghast by a wide margin in terms of cuteness."
0,Not gonna name one of them Taxes?
0,I just don’t understand why you can’t sprint with them and go a little faster
0,I love a big tall column in the middle if my world. Put a viewing platform at the top and crank that render distance!
0,"No comment of the episode??

Etho!! You completely forgot!
But man, those ghasts were so much fun to see, amazing episode !"
0,one way to make ghasts follow you is leashing them to an allay
0,"Honestly the happy ghast FEELS like a mod. Im not saying that as even a good or a bad thing, but of all the features this one just feels the most like what youd see in a mod. Its a little hard to describe but everything from the progression to just how different things are executed...if you uploaded this feature as a mod review itd be totally indistinguishable"
0,"Sometimes I'm less excited about features than seeing what Etho can do with them, happy ghasts is definitely high on that list. 

I agree with the elytra making all transportation irrelevant outside of ice boats but what makes them great is speeding up the game. I think Minecraft needs more late game advances that do that. I'd love something that makes building faster. Please please please. Survival Minecraft penalizes builders too harshly for the time vs reward investment. Let us build!"
1,"As someone who doesn't like parkour, I really want to know what got you into parkour after 15 years. What is it that you've discovered that made you give it another go?"
0,I think a race game with them would be hilarious. Mario cart in super slo-mo.
5,"Oh my, the ""silverfish bomb"" 🤣 I love the way your mind works Etho!"
0,arousal is the term you are looking for. You aroused the happy ghast.
0,9:19 Soarin? I bet he likes apple pie!
0,"I had an idea of using daylight sensors on the dried ghast, so they would be happy during the day, and be in water overnight, haven't tried it yet though."
0,you can add these into ravager rush almost like the  crossy road alligators!!!
1,The armour stand campfire thing you showed just solved Tango's latest problem with Hungry Hermits
0,Those new ghatsts are so cute! I'd love a happy ghast fueled hot air balloon lol
1,Can you imagine waking up and you’re a happy ghast in Etho’s Let’s Play.
0,"i honestly think happy ghasts are... fine enough for a 3 month update. in my personal opinion, it shoulda been a longer time between updates to let the features get more polished (and potentially be more plentiful) considering we're already getting a 1.21.7 soon because of some critical oversights, AND they're adding the bedrock exclusive painting to java *and a new music disc*
it really feels to me like they're unorganized and rushing these 3 month updates, they should be given more time to work and polish these things- and maybe a bit more focus could be nice too? like why randomly changing how splash potions work in this update? or adding the locator bar? or adding ""/dialog"" (which i personally find kinda insulting considering how they specifically Don't want it to be used as custom menus... but we don't really have anything that can be used as custom menus in its stead?)? the lead changes make sense considering the happy ghast, but that and the saddle/lead shearing changes are some of the only thematically relevant things in this update!!!
also, the dried ghast should have a model for when it's not supported by a block, it should look like it's dangling in the air"
0,"Hey etho, I was curious if there was any chance to  revisit the end portal base? I know it's been kinda of a mess for awhile but I think it'd be cool if you figured out something cool to design there or make nicer there?"
0,you can feed them snowballs to grow faster
0,"Maybe they need to add chains to the game. Chains could work like leads, but have a much stronger connection. Bonus is we can use them to make chainmail."
1,"Another great episode, Mama Etho! 😂 I love when you experiment with updates. 
I'm disappointed in Mojang for making the happy ghasts craftable now. I liked it better when they had to be found. Made them more interesting and unique."
0,15:40 etho can you use a splash potion of swiftness with the happy ghast
0,5:34 dried ghast torture farm 😢 maybe if they weren't so dehydrated you could harvest their tears of pain 😂
0,ETHOOOOOOOOOOOI🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
1,maybe reamimated
0,the lead thing is a velocity thing. if you go to fast the lead breaks. idk how many blocks per second that speed is though
0,The dinner bone name tag trick also works on the guests and you end up riding on the legs
0,"I think I saw that you can also place blocks on them while you're up in the air, almost like an angel block from modded? that could be useful for projects"
0,Wilson needs an update
2,The way the horse gets carried is so funny! Amazing addition to Minecraft
1,I really think that SoulSpeed contraption is pretty neat. Useful? Maybe not ... but definitely interesting. I'd love to see more scrapped projects like that.
13,"8:20 	Aestivate → de-aestivate – Technically correct construction, though “de-aestivate” is rare and mostly used in academic or niche biological contexts."
0,"I think it was season 9 you asked us what kind of base you should make, sky island, cave, or ocean I think were the options. With the happy ghast I think you have much more incentive to make a sky island build"
0,THE FOG ISN'T MY IMAGINATION?! I swear I thought I was going crazy!
0,Reanimated?
1,The wind charge tower at the end reminds me of the Carnival Hammer minigame. And maybe a Floating haunted mansion of some kind would be a cool build. All the sounds incorporated.
0,"I wonder if the solution to moving ghasts around is to just set up a spawning station at each work site, maybe next to each enderporter. It seems like it’s not too much an issue to get lots of babies, and transporting those would be a breeze."

0,cant wait for frogger 2: revenge of the ghasts
0,They should really add an iron lead that does not break
0,"Since you can hang a horse, couldn't you also hang a donkey and have a portable chest? Most importantly, a portable chest you can fill with shulkers, in addition to your inventory? Or, next level, a donkey in a chest boat allowing for a full double chest of shulkers?

Cause if you are already flying a ghast over, might as well save a trip or 2 having a large inventory underneath."
3,"""Happy"" for the new upload! 
I tried parkour it was pain and sadness, i finished the dailies in mcci yesterday... but never give me gap jumping from trapdoor to chains from the other day ;__; i raged quit lol
Baby ghast jumps might be my next pain..."
1,"Hey ergo, I found that using a riptide trident to get a boost with elytra while leading mobs works well, you just can’t get too much vertical acceleration at first so you sort of have to start looking horizontally then pitch up."
0,what if you used potions on the ghasts? like levitating or jump boost
0,"Hi Etho, good episode! I like the ones which are just messing around and experimenting. I wonder what speed potions are like with the Happy Ghasts? Also what if you swim along a dolphin highway while leading one? Or an ice road, can you put them in boats? Lots of questions! I might need to do some experimenting too! :D Anyways hope you're well, thank you for the upload ❤"

1,12:28 - underrated joke
0,no speed potion test? I'm a little surprised!
0,Im curious how the happy ghast hitbox works when it's named Dinnerbone/Grumm
0,"Hey Etho, I have a question about your let's play. Unless you've changed it up, I was wandering why you play it fully vanilla without mods which in my view only add to the game, and make it more convenient. Such as Sodium/Optifine, tweakeroo, that shulkerbox mod etc., and turn off enderman griefing with a datapack. Most obstacles in the game, like having the risk of being blown up by creepers, having to gather resources etc., as annoying as it can be add something to the game, but to me things like enderman griefing and having to place and look into your shoulker boxes take away from it for me. So I was curious as to why you do it your way on the lets play."
0,Can they be Potion’d for more speed? 🤔 or an invisible ghast…..?
0,Does Etho melt if he gets rained on?
0,What if you leashed it to a fence stood on top not mounted and then had the wind charges fire? You could use it like an elevator that carries you up and jump off of  and the ghst would return to the fence?
0,Do the classic TNT launcher work on the ghast? like a 3x3 with water surrounded by Dispensers with pistons. It might kill them? but a balance of the amount of tnt will probably work?
0,Your a momma now!
0,"27:00 for the managing aspect, maybe tie that into the happy ghast's stats, have 3 ways of upkeep, one for health, one for vertical speed, one for horizontal speed. Sure, it could be min-maxed, but it would be engaging. 

Since they cant be bred like horses, having the normal happy ghast with unchanged stats (the one in the video) be a result of just a timer and unchanged stats after unpetrifying, it could be neat"

0,That tube of wind charges towards the end just makes me think of bomb climbing in any of the Metroid games ^^
0,I wonder if they'll allow putting soulspeed onto the ghast saddles. I think it would make sense since they are made of soul sand.

0,"8:56 from my lightly modded experience, the amount of remaining growth time removed by feeding a baby animal scales downwards as the timer is lower, providing diminishing returns. it's probably the same with baby ghasts, but i haven't checked the code."

1,Glad you’re feeling and sounding better!
14,"8:01 About 'Hatching' or 'Rehydrating' not being quite the right word. I remember something about Tardigrades being able to survive for an impressively long time without water, the state their body goes into when they 'dry out' had a name that might be fitting for what happens to the Dried Ghasts!

Edit: i was able to find the video i heard about this from, it would be like saying the Dried Ghast has come out of it's tun state! (ref. TED-Ed Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby)"
0,"Man, after watching a bunch of Vintage Story content, the other block games core intended audience becomes *_very_* clear."
0,"You can lead a few together and name them puff, the, magic, and dragon."
1,"I understand the temptation for anything you can ride to be fast, but like you said, elytra wings already cover that perfectly. The happy ghasts are designed specifically to be useful for building, and if they were fast, it would be unwieldy and annoying to use for that!

I love that you gave them all names 🥰"
0,So glad etho isn’t sick anymore!
0,"Minecraft was never a game that implemented minigames to any of the mechanics (except for maybe fishing) and the people seem to very much like that. I think it might be because some minigames can become stale over time (imagine pressing the same buttons for the 100th time in a row), and the focus lies more on using the time however you like. That's why I think not adding more mechanics to the Ghast growing up is a good thing despite there being opportunities to add a funny minigame. But maybe there's a way to make it more exciting without being to monotonous."
1,"""I like that cry sound they make"" Etho villain arc starts now."
0,there should be a way to freeze the timer so u  can have the different faces and be able to silk touch them for decorations
0,maybe the solution to moving ghasts quickly is to use the old school punch bow to travel with the elytras?
0,wth etho has came out with a new video
0,That crackling sound is awesome for Decked out 3 😅
0,That's why I live in a no-rain biome.
0,It's so great to find an Etho video after a bad day.
0,I wonder if that old exploit with the power II bows people used before they added rocket boosting could be used to gain momentum without breaking the lead.  iirc Etho stockpilled a bunch of them* before they changed how enchantments can stack on a bow
0,25:22 ...can't you just stand on them as they go around?
0,8:17 I think “reanimating” like in Naruto with pain’s reanimation jutsu

0,"After seeing the Dried Ghasts + Wilson I thought about how the Dried Ghasts could be used as like, a counter/state machine. Where the random tick internal (If random) could be used to change a state. I don't know if it would be super useful, but, it felt like one of those odder methods of doing redstone you do once in a while."
0,ghast on ice?

0,"Hi Etho, i got a question about your project you started doing in the epised 574, the computer. I was very excited about it. Did you hit a wall, or you just dont want to continue this project?"
0,There is so much to do in Minecraft 20min seems insignificant.
1,"Ergo, how did you get the happy llamas to float around the Sandy City like that?"

0,Just watched Etho torture baby ghasts for 30 minutes
0,looks like frogger 2 might have to have ghast platforms for part of it
0,"Might be worth trying to launch from water with a Riptide Trident as well. That may be too much momentum for the lead, but riptide 2 could work for transporting happy ghasts!"
0,31:24: is it the velocity of having the ghast on the lead causing you to not make it? Too fast lead thinks it’s a rocket?
0,It's finally happened... Etho likes parkour
0,lots of things for kids lately...and this dude...we could use some things to make red stone better
0,"10:48 You could use it for an arid place, or possibly a cliffside to resemble the sound of rocks and pebbles cascading down."
0,How about reanimated?
0,I checked over 100 bone structures in the Nether without finding one. In the end i just crafted it with the tears i got whilst killing all the ghasts in the nether whilst looking =D
20,"The 20 minute rehydration + baby phases worked well on me. I spent a whole weekend fighting ghasts and dying for those tears, left one alone to rehydrate and it killed itself somehow, then babysat the next one for the full 20 minutes. I spent the 20 minutes after it successfully rehydrated jumping around and celebrating while admiring how cute it was. Psychological manipulation works!"
0,Awesome episode. Would love to see you play the Aether II mod!
0,I was kinda disappointed that this update was so amall although i do like the happy ghasrs a lot theyre a cool addition! Although i think there was probably a better way to do the saddles than to have 16 different items just for 1 mob...

0,"I like the 20 minute wait, I feel like it adds to the value/expense of the mob. (haven’t tried growing one up to happy myself, so disclaimer this is my opinion from the outside.)"
0,Hi etho! Do you have any plans for episode 600?
0,"Etho just so you know, The Happy Ghast is in fact, affected by potions, so you can make them faster. I don't think it has the same code for horses and making them faster and faster, but you can use potions."
0,"I don't mind the timer for the ghast rehydrating. We wait for turtle hatching too. I wouldn't want every mechanic to be slow and unskippable, but a few optional time investment mechanics in a game I think adds some variety as long as the pay off is good enough. I think the happy ghast pay off is worth it. (Incidentally, I DON'T think the turtle pay off is worth it)"
0,Might be interesting for mass item moving.
1,"Hey Etho, since you really enjoyed Terrafirmacraft and modded Minecraft, have you ever considered giving Vintage Story a try? I know you once mentioned you'd stick to Minecraft for algorithm reasons, but Vintage Story is so similar, do you think it could still work? 
Or have you ever thought about maybe starting a second channel for that kind of content?"

0,reanimation i think fits
24,The irony of Etho not having ghast tears is that he has an overpowered ghast tear farm on Hermitcraft.
0,Raining? Brings back memories from the MindCrack server where rain was daily weather. Can you use Speed potion on them to fly faster? You should also try the Preview Minecraft to see the new visual lightings 😊
0,"I like the cry sound they make

0,"Episodes start with hey this is Etho, would be neat if as an april fools gag an entire episode was done by another Mincecraft youtuber as if everything was normal."
6,"lol, Etho half your lets play videos are you discovering things that have already been invented.  We like your discovery process.  I remember X discussing this exact thing about your content like 7 years ago on stream lol.  it's a highlight, not a downside IMO"
1,The timer could be amazing for timing of games. You get a 20 min timer with 5 min intervals that you can easily track with redstone. You just remove the bucket at 19:30 mins and boom 20 min game timer with some hopper clocks.
2,I think what Happy Ghasts do is closer to suspended animation than estivation. At least to me it seems more of like a Waterbear rehydrating

0,"Can you do parkour neo jumps, Etho?"
0,"I think the reason why the ghasts don't get launched much from the slime block launcher or wind charge launchers is at least partially because you are controlling the mob which overrides its AI, same thing with the horse and the wind charges"
0,How about Casper?
1,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done. Hope you read this! :)

0,"From the Wikipedia page for _aestivation:_
""Another type of beetle (Blepharida rhois) also chooses to aestivate. They usually do so when the temperature is warmer and will re-emerge in the late summer or early fall.""

So it would seem that unlike for an egg hatching, there isn't a specific term for coming out of estivation.

So I guess _re-emerge_ would kind of work, not sure if other words are used by the science hippies too."

0,"I think for moving them, just attach a lead, ride them as high up as you can, and use them as your platform to jump off and elytra them away"
2,I should have expected Etho's first reaction to the Happy Ghast to be doing all kind of experiments on them!
0,I knew Etho would be a great mother
12,"I really appreciate the hands-on demonstration of redstone contraptions that worked as an addendum to the comment of the day! I think one of your greatest strengths as a YouTuber, teacher, and presenter is your ability and natural proclivity towards filtering out what content deserves to reach your audience and make it into an episode. I suspect that process doesn't always FEEL so intuitive, but I would herald it as an Etho superpower.

I love when you show the nitty-gritty of your projects (as is the formula for an Etho episode) yet I don't mind when you scrape redundancy.

I think you show examples of this every now and then: of terrain you have cleared for miscellaneous projects like the ""passive mob farm island,"" or contraptions that fall short of their intended purpose. I'm satisfied with what we're given.

Thanks Etho, this is a great episode! Goofing off is fun, too. I will always enjoy seeing what you enjoy doing."
0,mr sir etho can you hit a triple neo?
0,"This is gonna sound like a grumpy old fart who doesnt know there are already mods to fix most of this.
Honestly I'm pretty disappointed in the whole update. To start, the fog is terrible imo. I build things cause I want them to look that way, not white washed once I get 30 blocks away. Then theres the happy ghast which cannot go down easily, swings around in a somewhat strange way when you look side to side, moves painfully slowly (slower than walking! How is that allowed?) And is prone to wandering away into the skies, resulting you needing an elytra to retrieve it.
Then theres the player locator bar that explicitly covers up the xp bar... (who makes a ui element that completely covers up another ui element). Honestly kinda feels like an amature put this whole update together for their own 5 year old"

1,anyone else get an INSANE amount of ads with this video? like one every 5 minutes
0,Dried ghast torture timer is admittedly really funny. Its also a bit of a pseudo-random pulse generator if they only update on ticks. Might be a bit more compact than crop rng?
7,The Aether name tag seems so fitting. The happy ghasts would fit right in
0,I feel like Etho needs to make a level 2 to ravager rush on top of the happy ghasts after watching the last bit
0,Turtles also take a long time to hatch.
11,"They aren't using random ticks; they are scheduled ticks with a fixed length of time.  Once the Dried Ghast is on `hydration` level 3, then it's a random chance that it grows up at it's next scheduled tick.

If you are in creative and want to speed it up use the Debug Stick and make it hydration Level 3."

0,Try using a riptide 1 trident + elytra when it is raining to transport the happy ghast ;)
2,So dumb question but did you ever try speed potions? Not the best solution but maybe it's better than nothing?
0,"They diatroyed rocket-powered mob dangling? What a shame. Anybody broken the news to Scar? Is he okay? :,("
0,"i do like the happy ghast, but they should be a little bit faster. maybe not by default even, but a potion of speed should work for example, or maybe feeding them cake?, i dont know, but their speed is too slow to be usable and is a shame, because i think people would use them if only they were as fast as a donkey. i mean it flies, it stays around you, is more or less smart enough not to get killed while you do other things...

i get that their speed is suited for actually building, as you have shown with the slabs in the guardian farm, and that is good too, but still, there should be a temporary way to make them faster

the 40 minute timer on the other hand is a lot for a more casual player i suppose, i actually didnt think of that because 20 is standard timer for all the mobs, but this one is actually X2 and you cant skip half of it... i suppose that they want them to feel special, maybe is also because is the new thing, and in the future it will be easier, like they did with the lodestones, now they take iron, when before they took netherite"
1,why are there happy ghasts now?

0,"Now that I've seen them for a bit I feel like they're missing size variation. Like they want us to be attached to them, but every happy ghast looks the same. So either make them faster and just have them be the functional build helpers people want or add some lovable variations. Or do both things. Don't know why a lot of new things feel like they're pre-nerfed."

0,can you give them speed potions?
0,"This was such a classic fun episode, thanks for the video!"
4,"the 20 minutes timer makes sense. Turtle eggs take forever to hatch and it's only during nighttime. I think it teaches kids that patience is necessary and also if you can't find anything else to do in your minecraft world for 20 minutes than literally just afk, play with the ghast and log off bc that's what you're gonna do anyways

like, as a chemist and nature lover... sometimes things literally just take time to happen, not even just biological processes"
27,"I've had to replay several parts of this video to understand what Etho's saying because I got too distracted by the cuteness. Ghasts leading other ghasts, the horse pulling a ghast around - oh my goodness!

Been away from the community for a bit now, but I always love learning about new Minecraft updates from Etho.

22,"With both this update and the previous one, you’ve had an absolutely bonkers turnaround time for your videos! Very impressive!

The inclusion of Aether and Ur-Ghast (and others, I’m sure) in the happy ghast names is absolutely adorable, I love them a lot. You’ve me nostalgic about Twilight Forest now! Also, this has actually taught me about the term “aestivation” and I’m so determined to start using it, so thanks for that!

Your tests in this video were so incredibly interesting and thorough, absolutely worth the watch. I can’t wait to see what people do with the happy ghasts; their slow speed makes them seem impractical for a lot of stuff (most types of travel, notably) but there’s so much more that they’re definitely to be great for. 

I almost want to see about making some type of minigame similar to keeping a balloon from falling on the floor by hitting it upwards… knockback weapons are sure to make these guys go flying!"
0,i bet theres something fun between happy ghasts and allays with leads. they might keep the allays from flying away

It's not fun to wait for it to oxidise, I don't want orange in builds where I want copper green, and there's very few methods to speed it up (and they're very non-intuitive). I end up hating using oxidised copper even when it would look good because of the oxidation process, and usually go for prismarine even though it's not the same shade. I can definitely see the same happening with the Happy Ghast, though I like your tomogachi idea as a way to have fun in the meantime."
10,"Enjoyed the playing with sound moments, and the names too were great. I also appreciate that you include trial and error, it’s the journey. Thx for the content as always .  Now I’ll go back to re-watching (again) Friday Night Stabby vods."
0,"I agree that 20 minutes is probably pretty excessive for the (revitalization?) time, but the argument about attachment is a fair one to make too. It’s kind of one of those tricky things that has you asking if it’s a good  thing to have an aspect of it that can’t be super optimized, or if it’s too frustrating that it can’t be optimized in that way. 
Either way, I think just a bit of a time cut might be the better solution for it."
1,"Etho you should play on the zero minr server if you want to do parkour - it's one of the oldest minecraft servers with a lot of history and the community is amazing, they have loads of high quality maps and you can play at whatever difficulty you want. The server also made me actually like mazes too."
0,9:17 Name another one Flyin
0,after all these years still my fav minecrafter :P good stuff mr etho
0,"Remember to give the video a like, everyone! 💜💜💜"
0,"Nice birthday gift for me 🎉, thanks etho"
242,"7:50 ""I'm Mama now"" is killing me XD

These guys are the cutest ever!

Genuinely love the experiment part after every update, most of these experiments are things I'd never think of asking but are actually very helpful!"
46,that soul speed idea is awesome
1,"19:36 uhm, sir this is a nono shape"
0,I wonder if the old bow boosting would work for gaining height while dragging the ghast TBH
0,etho uploading always makes me happy
1,"As a modded player I don't really like the new release schedule. Modders have no chance to keep up with updating and developing their mods.
With the old release schedule, large/important mods usually updated every other version: 1.12, 1.14, 1.16, 1.18, 1.20 were all popular versions for modding. The rest got skipped by most large mods because modders didn't have the ability to bugfix, update and add features as fast as mojang updated the game.

I fear that an even faster update schedule will make creating modpacks much more difficult as mods will get scattered all over many different versions as a result, but we will see how that turns out. After all, these updates are supposed to be smaller so maybe updating mods to a new version will get easier?"
0,Ur-Ghast mentioned! (I love twilight forest)
84,"i feel like the happy ghasts are the perfect amount of derp that go well with etho. i hope we get to see more of them! (i also hope you eventually name one taxes)

and man, the parkour made me nostalgic, remembering how i obsessed over it in minigame servers and parkour maps. can't wait to see what people do with the happy ghasts now."
79,"5:08 What a casual flex, Etho"
0,"As someone whose name is Soren, I had a double take when etho named his ghast soarin and the name aloud heh 😅"
0,In this episode: Etho torments babies
0,The ghast will be super useful in the end when building etho!
0,"etho!!! i just graduated high school (this morning ^^) thank you so much for all the content you've made theoughout the years. growing up watching your stuff has been such a privilege. you sparked my interest in redstone as a kid which translated into seeking a career in interactive design and game development :] thank you, etho"
0,I really enjoy your game update videos!! I love the different experiments and how goofy you get with them 😂 Thanks for the video Etho!
0,"Hey etho! I think the issue you were having with the horse being pulled by the ghost is from the player sitting on the horse. Same happens with boats and other rideables. But, if you attach a boat with a pig wearing a saddle to a ghast, you can ride the pig and the ghast will fly around by itself! Not sure about the practical applications of it, but if there’s anybody who could think of something, it’s you!"
0,"The Happy Ghast parkour and Dried Ghast observer/sculk sensor mechanics have big adventure map potential. The parkour is an obvious moving platform jumping puzzle, which hasn't previously been easily do-able. And the sculk sensor stuff can be used to create a random timer for some survival challenge, like waiting for a door to open whilst some zombie hoard tries to attack you and you need to fight them off!"
0,I hate the newish rain changes too.
0,"Etho, you are loved!"
0,Those names!
2372,I think the timer is to prevent people from making them on site to help with building then killing them afterward.  Basically using them like disposable build aids instead of pets.
2,"Hey Etho, I was wondering how your commentary has changed and what you do to sound more charismatic than in your older videos."
0,"Frogger/Ravenger Rush upgrade incoming, now with Happy Ghasts as moving platforms for crocodiles/logs?"
0,"Since I don’t play Minecraft anymore, I’ve been avoiding other hermits videos to watch Etho first play around with the Happy Ghasts. Can’t wait to watch!"
0,Could the Happy Ghasts not being thrown high by the wind charges be because the player is sat on top of them? How would it work if the player was stood up instead of sitting?
0,Slab slab etho slab
3,I really liked that soul speed boots sorter sure It is probably more trouble than it is worth but still that is neat and could be applied in mob farms which have player kills involved and you get armor if you wanted to sort it or bin it easier.
10,"Loving the “behind the scenes” stuff, more please!"
0,The wait time for the ghast is at least better then like the turtle eggs. That is 3-5 game nights >.<
0,"I've been thinking about the happy ghasts a lot lately tbh, they're so happy"
1,"I started a new world on my Linux OS last night, I JUST found a pair of dried ghasts and I havent even made my first base yet... playing this game from zero makes these things infinitely more appealing, I cant wait to use these things everywhere, and you can craft em!?!! I am finally building a ghast farm, I want to keep a few of these leashed in various places, I found a village up on a plateau between a bunch of mountains with ravines, its either build bridges or HAPPY GHAST LANDING STATIONS!

very excited for the first time since like... man, gotta be caves and cliffs, to seriously bed down in a new world, my old worlds are functionally lost for me, I wont be logging into my microsoft OS for a while now that I got my games running on Ubuntu."
0,"There he is, my favourite Canadian!"
0,"I just got finished errands and had sat down for like a minute when you uploaded, perfect timing ❤
Thank you for all the content you’ve provided over the year, I love watching you explore new updates even though I don't play anymore 😅"
0,Love all the testing you do with new blocks and mobs!!
0,🎉
18,Good to hear your voice is better. I was worried you were morphing into Doc :P
1,"8:00 let's call it ""they sponge up"""
1,5:11 Woah woah woah who is this guy and what did you do with ETHO🥶
0,LETS GOOO
0,"Etho, you need to get new carpet in your original area. The current carpet is ten years old."
247,I like like Etho is showing us his designing process lately.
1,"Etho, I picked up gardening as a job a while ago and I loved it. It was a shame there were some slimeballs who I had to work with who put an early noose on that carreer choice, but I learned a lot and met many very funny good folk."
13,I love the ghast names lmao 😂
0,"Oh, EthosLab just posted a let's play. STOP EVERYTHING! Thanks Etho!"
0,I was thinking that it's prob better to just keep extra dried ghasts and just raise a new one wherever you are.
12,"Hey Etho! Now that we got an easy method to get Ghasts to the overworld, maybe you could build a Nether-style ""corrupt"" village? It would be a fun concept to play with, especially as these little bits of lore add so much to the world download."
0,"Xisuma and the Hermits had a happy ghast rave/concert with the new disk, and I think the new arrow mechanics are disturbing Tango's games."
0,so do something else for 20 min.... not that hard...
0,Clicked on the video so fast! Excited to watch it!!
0,This isn't the new sorting system!
0,happy to be part of the revolution
0,"Hey Etho, in all your years of Minecraft what is your signal favorite update that you feel was the most fun on release?"
0,"Well, wasn't this a nice test and goof around episode. I love these. I learned many ways and uses of slowly torturing dried ghasts for their sounds. 😅"
0,yaaaaaaaaaaaaay
0,Do speed potions work on the Happy Ghasts??
0,could piston highway things be useful for making them transport faster?
0,"Hi Etho! How about ""regeneration"" for the process the dried ghast goes through? Or ""rehydrate"" (my afterthought)?❤"
0,Used to pray for times like this
0,"I think that the happy ghasts should stay babies _permanently_ until you feed them snowballs, because I love the baby ones and I would want to keep some of them small in my world"
2,"Great video, as always. Also, I love words and it's not often that I learn a new word from watching gaming content creators. Thank you for adding aestivation to my repertoire"
0,"You love parkour? Then I guess you only hated Cubfan's dungeon's parkour, the one with skeletons where you had a nose bleed."
14,Nothing puts a smile on my face quite like when I see that Etho uploaded
0,Etho!!
0,😊
0,I thought Etho lived underground because he hates building exteriors
0,04:20 is that nose bleeding side effect...?
0,Of course etho is gonna find a way to use the new mob in redstone lmao
0,Momma Etho!
0,"2:49 don’t know if you care, but incase you do and you forgot, your boots don’t have thorns. (Is this backseating?)"
0,Ohhh that voice!  ❤

0,"Etho, please pay attention to the pr0n bots rampant in the video comments.

Besides that, this video made me smile a ton. Thanks so much. Your personality is the best. Super down-to-earth and sincere."
0,Wait so dried Ghasts are just dehydrated Trisolarans. Got it
1,9 happy ghasts etho made in his survival world is tamed but meanwhile on the hermitcraft server theirs about 400 happy ghasts and most of them ended up in scar's base
16,"I had more fun than I've ever had in this game by taking one of these through a huge cave with a friend and doing drive-by diamond mining. Weaving through tight corridors, dodging skeleton shots and lavafalls"
413,"5:10
Etho Causally jumps on baby ghasts

Update: Now he’s doing experiments on them."
0,Oooo parkour era Etho??
0,"That in-air building is potentially game changing tho. Amazing, I hate building with scaffolds"
0,"Always liked fog in Minecraft, until this update. Feels like my eyes are clouded over. Had to install simple fog to adjust it"
129,"Ah yes the new uses of ghasts as parkour blocks and a redstone clock, never stop etho"
5,"I've not played the modern version of this game in years, I thought this was modded for the first few minutes lol

SOOO much has changed!"
33,The way you stay grounded is so admirable.

4,Who else is here after seeing the comment on geminitays past life episode one video?
1,etho im watching naruto shippuden rn are you proud of me
0,"this build is amazing, really looks so fun"
3,One of the only youtubers who actually sound different when they're sick
0,Etho you have blown my mind every episode for a decade if not more! Love the natural essence in your builds along with efficiency and cool tricks! Love the clock and little details. Love from your fellow Canadian!
0,Want to wish Etho a “get well soon” and ask him how the heck his voice still sounds cool even when he’s getting raspier than sandpaper.
0,It's odd that Etho has a family at all. It seems like he has just been time immemorial.
0,"Man, that quiet raspy voice took me back to the days of Nebris and Mindcrack!"
0,"I love what you have been doing with the base, also the secret passages and space maximization are funny.
Glad to see that The Nameless Shop is now open. :D"
0,"Man, the voice crack macking it into the vid is insanely funny lol
The ravagers are funnier lol
It's late, butIi wish you a smooth recovery"
0,"Got my snacks, my water, and we’re layed up in a hammock for the night.. time to catch up on etho vids :)"
0,I implore you to watch bdubs newest video if you haven’t already .. youll enjoy it! Big ego boost for you.
0,okay wow i read the comments about the voice but i did not expect it to get this bad
0,Did etho ever do a face reveal? Lol old video from 10 years ago here lol
0,Speaking of llamas
0,"I love the interior of the house Etho, really cool"
0,Wow Etho is not a AI.
0,Etho sounds like an acadian granpa later on in the video lolzz
0,Omg your mic quality is high. Im high too
0,"imagine this was his last video
horrifying to think about"
0,can someone make a tutorial for the netherite upgrade station i really like it but im confused how to build it
1,React to ethosuave Minecraft song
0,"Hey, do you know Etho Aki? He says he's in your group."
0,=)
0,wow so this is the guy who made rekrap
0,"I love the speaking of llama's transition, lmao. first time I heard it, I rewound to see if there was context. second time, I was like, naturally this makes sense. Then the third time, I was like, wait, how does this make sense?"
0,Etho your next base should be a giant mechanical mess that only you can effectively navigate with levers and buttons that make things in all the wrong places
0,"25:35 I switched to flashback from ReplayMod a few months ago. Glad it’s getting more attention, I find it much better and easier to use over ReplayMod."
0,What if the ravagers looked inwards and down like they are staring down a player standing in front of the shop?
0,How did you get the llamas to circle around sandy city?
0,This voice only gets better through the episode
0,You should try Vintage Story. It’s the continuation of Terrifirmacraft by the creators
0,"Hey Etho!
I heard you were complaining about Windows 10 and now you are going to switch to Windows 11 on your new PC. Windows 11 might be better than Windows 10, however, there is more ""Microsoft"" advertisements in Windows 11 than in Windows 10. Have you maybe thought of switching to Linux? Many are now actually switching, and you are mostly using Minecraft right? Minecraft is well supported under Linux, as well as almost all steam games as well. You might need to switch editing software or find simillar software for this. I would recommend Linux Mint, for a beginner. It is almost set up out of the box, drivers are easy to install (Nvidia drivers)"
0,"Etho its okay i know your secrert i know you are the REAL KAKASHI SENAEI You are secretly Japanese and the irl KAKASHI SENSEI yes you are canadian BUT foooooof
D 

Ps you are a GREAT voice actor luve youuuuuu byeeeeeeeee 😘😘😘😘😘"

0,Has etho finished his *whispers: fight club** yet??
0,Speaking of llamas
0,get well soon!!!
0,Get into bed and drink some chicken soup! D:
0,"thanks for making a video despite being sick! i love what you did with your base, and your shop looks even more awesome now~
i hope you get well soon <3"
0,with the new pc maybe we could get more modded stuff soon? 🥺
0,Now we all need pants with Etho's face on it. XD
1,"Etho I just gotta say, I’ve been watching you content for probs 10 years at this point & I don’t think I’ve ever left a comment, thank you for all the videos"
0,"I hope you feel better soon! fun episode, love the little ravager statues, they're super cute!"
0,is this replay mod-ish thing something that will used in your LP. I know you dont use mods in that series but i think this one could add to the viewing experience
0,3:59 and 14:37 speaking of llamas serotonin
0,I liked the snapshot of Etho's videos in 40 years
0,Etho has 19:11
0,"Hiya Etho! Feel better soon!!! Always wish you the best. You give us all a safe bit of time to enjoy, and that's priceless. Your build is gorgeous. I love the colors you used. Thank you!!! <3 ~respect"
0,"Feels like a Picasso home, kinda neat."
0,Doc? That you?
0,I appreciate you powering through your illness. hope you recover quickly.
0,maybe some copper trap doors & warped trap doors for the ceiling to break up the flatness and give it a little dimension? and anything hanging also does so much in my experience. lanterns can light up the ceiling a bit so the lighting is more evenly strewn about the room with maybe some lanterns on chains for differentiation! i'm sure you've thought of all this but i just want to give my two cents :)
0,14:50 I don't think anyone can beat X at that game but i'd like to see you try
0,Ethos over trying to be Tom Hanks!! 😂😂😂
0,Haven't played MC for years and the base tour felt like a fever dream ·-·
0,Etho appears to be so normal in other people's videos you would never expect him to be the most whimsical babygirl on Hermitcraft
0,Dude you can tell how much you were looking for anyway to stay busy you're doing things that I never thought would change but to be honest this is the best video I've seen from you in such a long time when you saw the smiley face on your pants and than notice the headband was so sincere it made me see you in a different light. This video was great
0,I love the ravager statues! so much personality and details
0,Andesite for the roof etho!!
0,Get well soon etho!
0,The functionality of the base while also looking great is what most players dream of
0,Etho apologizing for his voice again at the end of the video is the most Canadian thing ever
0,It's crazy how good you've gotten at building Etho! Well done!
0,ETHO IS EVOLVING 😭😭😭😭
0,Really enjoyed the 'behind the sceens' of editing and the new software.  Hope you get betteer soon!
0,Did anyone else think etho sounded like batman
0,"when the world download becomes available, I will live in Etho's base"
0,"I was really expecting that Netherite diamond trim armor to end up in lava to turn the lava blue.
Love the base, Etho! So many nifty things."
3,"Hope you get well soon, Etho. Thanks for making a video, despite your worsening voice."
0,get well soon :) great apisode as always
0,If you keep going I’m going to have to turn on my subtitles. Lol go sleep.
0,18:30
1,"boy, you might've gotten me sick, too! I'm starting to sound like you at the end of the video, lol. Hope you feel better soon!"
0,I have always wondered how replay mod looked behind the scene
0,Ethos sounds like it chocolate island etho
0,"Hearing your voice getting rougher throughout the video hit hard, like dang dude really toughin' through it 💪 awesome job with Ravager Rush and the base, grateful as always for your content! Get well soon 🙏"
0,Etho is so skilled he never used paper once in the rock paper sizors
0,dark prismarine ceiling?
2,18:25 saving this for no reason
0,Ethoo please bring back project Ozone or something similar!!
0,hi doc!
0,"I wasn't super stoked ahout the way the sign looked at first, but I love the way it turned out. Fantastic work as always!"
0,started to sound like Doc halfway through 🤣💙
0,Speaking of Llamas says the man who was not at all speaking of llamas.
0,Another certified Etho classic. Love the end build with the minecarts and Snake riding the middle ravager!
0,"this was an amazing episode, i love how the ravagers went from accurate but kinda bland to NO WAY YOU WOULDNT 😭😭. Also i think i lost it more than your voice at every cut"
1,For the ravager statues I feel like you could use slabs (dark oak most likely) at the same level as the eyes to achieve that squinting look they have. It would also increate their 5HEADs. Other than that everything is amazing! Hope you get well soon...!
0,@EthosLab for the ravage uni-browns can you try slabs instead of full blocks?
0,What about frog lights for the ravergers eyes?
0,"i like the colour stuff you are doing with the sign with the stained glass at the end, it looks more interesting than a single colour 👍"
3,"Thanks for the vid Etho, always happy to see you on my feed. BUT, get some rest dude, we all want you to feel better."
1,24:15 😂
0,"34:17 make it so the ravagers are looking at the sign, it will make the sign more of a focal point"
57,"26:00 As a graphic designer for large retail signs, yes, kinda. 
So if you hold up your guide to the building from the place you want people to see (like a highway or street or back of a parking lot) then your font size should be at least 32-72pt in size at arms distance on a sheet of paper is the recommended amount.

Bigger the better...
- Now lets follow city regulations. (structurally sound, lighting/brightness, blocking skylines/horizons, etc.) Disney actually made a mandate that you cant build higher than X height in it's county because a skyscraper might show up.
- Now lets check the cost. (shrink the sign down to make it fit in the budget.) Companies like Walmart don't really have a budget cap we'd hit for example.
- Finally it's style, how does it look to the exterior designers and visionary of the brand. 


Quick guide on font sizing:
6pt: you don't want people to read
8-11pt: body text
12pt-14pt headers or low amount of body text (unless your typing an essay.)

Now we use the golden ratio to scale up from there for your headers:
Previously small font x 1.618 will be your  next scaled up font. 

This is all based around Letter paper size. 

So if you hold up your guide to the building from the place you want people to see (like a highway or street or back of a parkinglot) then your font size should be at least 32-72pt in size at arms distance on a sheet of paper is the recommended amount. 

Now go and design some signs!"
0,His sick voice idk why it hit me in the heart. I love it and feel. Bad for em. Sick streak is over
0,29:50 they sure are good boys
0,"Considering the limited time you had for this episode, your progress was insane... and you're sick on top of that. Love the new front of Ravanger Rush "
0,Etho = No(Time + Plan) = Complete Episode
77,The way Etho's voice was progressively getting worse the longer the video went was both hilarious and sad 💀. Hope you feel better Etho!
0,"I think the Ravager forehead should be one block higher perhaps!
I love the expressions, anyway!!
Edit: Yeah, especially when seen from below, I think they should be higher."
0,"I'm a bit late, but I love how you and the rest of the Hermits stick to making your videos about Minecraft. It's not about showcasing something bizarre, new, or ""impossible"", nor is it about telling some kind of scripted story that you are placing on top of your gameplay as some sort of recap. Everything you all do is for the sake of playing Minecraft -- building, making minigames, enjoying other people's creations, etc. Just taking in time to enjoy what the game has in *real time* is what makes us enjoy your content and be fine with your time lapses."
0,Early 2010s Etho came back by the end of the episode 😂
0,"Why do you get sick so much, bro?"
0,💚💛❤️
0,There’s zoning requirements that regulate the size of signs.  In our city your sign can be 2 sf for every foot of building wall width.  Your sign would likely be way over then sign size requirements and would require a Variance.  Thankfully this is Minecraft though and no one cares.
0,"Etho seams to be collorblind😂😂
Blue=Green/turquoise 😂"
0,Hope you're feeling better soon ergo! ❤
0,appreciate you fighting through the sickness to get this done. take some rest & enjoy tge ti.e with your family
0,"I hope Ethos knows even if he loses his voice forever we'll still watch anything he makes, great episode, hope you get better tho"
1,"Love how Egor made a cameo towards the end there o; 

We havent heard from them is years how is Egor doing these days etho? :p"
0,I would love if u did a better the wolves play though I think u would like it also
0,The voice crack cracked me up lol
0,"Thank you for the dedication it’s much appreciated but now it’s time to rest up 
:)))))"
2,"25:05 I highly recommend using the flashback mod, once you get the hang of it, you're able to make some amazing stuff with it! I've personally been using the mod for some projects, the amount of control it gives you has given me opportunities to create some really cool cinematic shots. I'd love to see the inclusion of the mod in some of your future videos!"
1,Etho you don’t really need “Flashback” if you can use “Timelapse” it’s so much more easier
0,"i wont lie, at first glance, i thought those ravagers were given pink buttholes"
0,Enjoyed the episode. Hope you are feeling better.
7,"@13:05 That deadpan humor gets me every time, lol"
0,I grabbed my snacks
0,"idk who the man is at the end of the video, bring back etho!!"
0,I have the same birthday as you
0,"Love the new ravager rush build, one suggestion maybe is to change the green frog to a different color as it doesn't have the same ""oomph"" as the red one since it blends more with the rest of the build's colors."
0,Your colour palette for the base is beautiful!! It all comes together wonderfully
0,Is this an etho video or a doc video ahah get well soon😂
0,The interior is beautiful. You really hit home with this one. Too bad you'll use it sparingly.
0,Etho turned into Nebris! Thanks for the video as always. Rest well!
0,"Rest well and recover soon ! this episode was very interresting to watch, especially the ravager simplification ! :D"
0,I actually like the glimpse of the behind-the-scenes process! Glad you had some time and had fun with it!
0,"Awww etho 💔feel better soon! Thank you for the vid! Loved the ravagers!!!! So cute.

Honey in tea is good for a sore throat :)"
19,Sick Etho reminds me of Etho from years and years ago when he spoke much more softly and quietly
0,NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT LLAMAS!
0,He sounds like his olllddddd self with the way his sick raspy voice is and with how much slower he has to talk lol
0,Wish you a speedy recovery Etho!
3,"_We need to introduce Etho's house as lore!_ 
THE James Bond Etho   _E007_
But colorblind. 4:50
He probably pulls a plant out of a pot to activate potions out of the ceiling, wall, or flooring. Animators?
Awesome Job"
0,"Wow the basemenet of the base is looking really good. Your build style continues to be one of the most unique and enjoyable to watch come together.

Also - freaking loving the new recording tech; super fun to see more of the build process in a way that doesn't dominate the video (which I know is something you've been concerned about in the past).
We love your voice btw. Its very very soothing. The raspiness wasn't particularly bad sounding until the last 5 min at which point it was only uncomfortable to listen to because I felt I could imagine it being uncomfortable for you.

Massively appreciate you squeezing out a video between all your family obligations."
0,"With a little bit of accent, his voice at the end would be great for an impression of Docm 😂😂"
0,Thx for the episode
0,"I've never seen those as chains, always thought of them as mouths. Now I can't see anything but chains."
0,"There is a game like modded Minecraft in your old play called Vintage Story, check it out,"
0,"The behind the scenes watching you build is a big change compared to last month or even many years ago when I started watching you, but it makes the videos feel more complete and fulfilling in my opinion. I commented on an earlier video saying how it would be cool to have these types of interactions (not sure if you saw it or not) but it's cool seeing it come to life and makes me feel more involved in the process instead of a cut to it all being done and you explaining what we missed keep up the good work etho and get well soon!!"
0,Always love any episode you put out. Hope you feel better soon!
0,The baked-light-gradient base is *very* Von Sway.
0,"Hello E tho, I love your videos!"
0,Thank you daddy🥵🥵🥵
2,Etho you need to rest 😡
0,I love hearing about your behind the scenes stuff
0,so cute!!!
0,The go-carts rock!
0,"We really appreciate you still going through with this episode even though your voice worsened more and more. It was both hilarious and painful at the same time. And that voice crack was legendary haha.
Overall an excellent episode regardless of the circumstances :D
I wish you the swiftest of recoveries!"
0,Give one of the Ravager a derpy expression to mirror the meme of the three dragons with 2 serious and 1 derpy face !!! Loving the vids ❤
0,"If you're searching for things to do (and in case you forgot), I'm just gonna mention the fishing rod fight club arena."
0,Legend!
0,Awww you sound so sick by the end of this video my dude. Go get your feet up and have a good brew xx
0,"Try using half slabs to move the unibrow half a block lower. It'll really help with the proportions to make it look more like a ravager and less like an illager.

Wonderful episode, by the way."
0,17:44
0,I dont think I've seen a hermit go into that much detail on their thought process for a sign. I really enjoyed the perspective and breakdown of the design philosophy
0,Got my snacks!
0,Maan i want to see somebody make cubs rock paper scissors completely random and then fight him and see how long it takes him to figure out that its random xD
0,I was like “if I was him id put the ravagers looking down over the sign” he then proceeds to and then also capture the nostalgia of an old McDonalds play pen or Safari Run. The creativity is always so fascinating
0,"by the end, Etho ended up sounding like Nebris"
0,"when you were looking at the ravagers and you said ""muzzle"" it made it think ""what if ravagers actually dont have a big nose and that is just a muzzle?"""
0,how did Etho get Doc to do the oiceover at the end?
0,"Yes, I thought the same, a very useful Base, and good looking. Annnd thanks for not scraping it 🤗"
0,The interior looks really good!!!
0,sick etho sounds like my uncle and now i am missing vancouver ):
0,1:56 you can probably use purple to connect lighter shades of blue to pink
0,Don’t wanna shovel sand?!! You mean like a sucker would do?
0,I love the goofy ravagers!! You naild it!
0,Thank you for your videos
0,"Here before etho hogs all the server's glowstone to put below his lakes/ponds.

Jokes aside, awesome content!"
0,So just so everyone new and old knows yes Etho's skin is Kakashi of the sharingan
0,33:47 reminds me of a place called goats on the roof or smth like that
0,Take care etho😢
0,Etho’s voice is already soothing. Like if I’m having trouble sleeping I turn on a video of his. But sick Etho’s voice is just another level.
0,"I loved seeing the behind the scenes of your video. I always wonder how content creators use replay and mods like it to make videos in minecraft, so that was a neat peek into it!"
1,"As someone who works in graphic design it is absolutely a thing that big corporations do, there's actually a science to how big your font is externally and internally.  Especially at the grocery stores, they will intentionally make the font in the isle small so if you stand on the end of the isle you have to walk into the isle a little bit to fully read them, potentially prompting you to buy something you weren't there for."
0,Maybe for the village room. Crimson or warped wood slabs and stairs. Crimson stairs and Warped slabs.
0,I knew the painting in the entrance was going to have something!
1,#Etho what program was that? Id like to try it out!
0,In the last few minutes it sounded like chocolate island Etho
0,Half slabs over the eyes for the unibrow would also give the bigger forehead.
0,"Your poor voice, I hope you get better Etho!"
0,"I always thought the ravager's ""harness"" was its mouth. You can see through it even."
0,"Honestly, for the time lapses,  just flying around doing a voice over while watching previous Etho build is a good way to do it. I find those smooth key frame shots very repetitive and it makes every time lapse look the same. Flying around like that makes it feel more personal and then you can point at things directly as you talk about which is cool"
0,I wish you good health ❤️ 🤗
0,"Feel better, Etho!"
0,I feel like Etho is in a constant state of sickness
0,I’ve been watching for like 12 years prolly more has been the only consistent thing in my life
0,"i love the cartoon eyes on the ravagers, i hope you feel better soon etho!"
1,you sound like terraria zombie by the end ❤
0,"Sorry to hear you've been feeling ill Etho, I hope you're feeling better soon. It was crazy hearing your voice change throughout the episode though. Really like the design of the Ravager rush building, and the Ravager faces are hilarious absolutely love them. Keep up the great work Etho!"
1,"""Frogs and Frags"" would encompass both Rush and froglights."
0,I hope you're OK.
0,Hope you get better Etho!
0,What do you mean a couple weeks..
0,Just wanna say get well.Been watching for a long time. Love every upload I get from you :)
0,Upstairs colors are Victorian era ones.
0,top of “season 10” hermitcraft search!
0,"I think maybe your sign would look more unique? personalized? if you moved the Rush to the right margin and doubled the wake lines as if the 'RUSH"" was moving left to right. Loved the episode. Thanks for the great entertainment."
0,"Suggestion: if you use blackstone (or any dark color) half slabs for the ravager brows, you can make smoother  lines for cartoonish expressions while still keeping the unibrow effect. Also, the minecarts are adorable. They look like faces 😁😁"
0,"etho found flashback mod!!!!!!!!!!!! everybody panic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
also etho you could release an hour long episode with no voice whatsoever and i'd practically watch it twice, *fans* will watch anything (might not appeal to all viewers- especially not new viewers- i admit, but still, we'll watch anything you want to make!!!)"
0,Stay hard working etho we love you
0,"I love the goofy ravagers. now if only youtube would recommend me your videos on time. I spent the entire day yesterday on yt, I watch everyone of your uploads but i guess youtube thought no let's just recommend slop instead."
0,"Yeah, Etho, it's fine. Go ahead and take all the time you need to take care of family stuff and take care of yourself. We'll all be here when you're rested, healthy, and ready to make videos again."
0,feel better etho!!! we missed you!!! ty for the upload 🥰🥰
0,:insert drawing of a cow as a bookshelf: (she's smiling and very happy to hold your books for you)
0,Started to sound like Nebris at the end of the episode lol
0,"hey etho hope you are in good health, just wondering if youve seen any of the color theory videos by gneiss name, he's made a 3D display that shows where blocks would be in relation to their color. If i remember right it was very configurable, thought it might be a good resource for you and your building style"
0,Really appreciate the behind the scenes look at replay. Gotta say the freecam look at the speed-up footage was so cool - way better than the smooth camera. It's more the Etho style.
1,"This video made me want to cough lol, thank you for making a video!"
0,"i'm rewatching this episode for the second time already, i love it so much"
0,Are the paintings vanilla?
0,"I always love hearing and seeing your Behind the Scenes things, it makes the videos seem more personal. I remember you talking about some behind the scenes stuff in a SP video a while back on how you did your recording. I think it was around the Lava Cauldron episode."
0,"Wild armor trim looks awesome on boots, makes them look like sneakers."
0,21:42 not etho (unintentionally?) teasing the life series!
1,We should get a whisper episode
0,"i just want give you a tea with honey, or maybe a very spicy chili. feel better. eefo!"
0,"""Not supposed to show the behind the scene editing""?
I'm actually LEARNING something during the 'montage'. This should be STANDARD!
Yknow Just tips and tricks about the editing software, while the building is built shown.
YOU put as much of a standard as anyone else. Maybe people follow your minecraft standards more than of others, but that's not the point I'm trying to make."
0,Get well soon! 🎈
0,Your base really does look pretty nice.
0,"""I took a little bit of a break""?
You took a little bit of a crack you mean? Voice crack.
Summer crack's about to begin in Sweden. The vibe will be so good ^^"
16,29:00 I love that the eyes on the statues appear when you get closer. Almost like they're waking up as you approach
3,"*@EthosLab* 29:09 Ravagers, ask *(Mob Boss) Scar* to deliver some ravagers to your game roof :)
Maybe you can hide some rails behind the sign, and then have a ravager in a minecart drive around, so from the ground, it looks like the ravager is first poking its head up on the right side, then on the left side, then somewhere else... (maybe randomly determined route?)
31:50 At LEAST 1+1 blocks wider, or 2+2 blocks wider (2 blocks on each side), currently that is just a ""villager dimensioned"" ravager, ravagers are wider than villagers. (Get well soon!)"
0,⌨🎮
1,"*@EthosLab* 22:39 You actually do HAVE moss half-slabs, including vertical half-slabs....
Use the armor-stands mod & sink a moss-block halfway into another (offset by a pixel, to avoid Z-fighting flicker).
ZombieCleo used this technique on her house, to make 2 trap-doors take up the same block in an inner-corner, cor a complete border of trap-doors around the foundation of her house.
Just make sure the base-plate of the armor stand doesn't intersect a solid block, that screws up the lighting (I think? ask Cleo if needed)."
1,etho is finally 15
0,"i was thinking big ravager statue/facade over the building and a frog on its head or something with some froglight acessories/bling (necklace,ankle band...)"
0,"Ooof, hope it's not the razor blade throat variant I've been hearing about. Hope you get plenty of rest either way!"
0,I love the new Ravager Rush exterior. Feel better soon!
0,The ravagers are definitely my new favorite part of this build
0,Oh my god oh no
0,Hope you get better Etho!
0,"Hey etho, I wonder how it would look if you placed a pink banner under one of the ravengers. I wonder if it would look like a tongue sticking out or if it would be too distracting."
0,I like the flashback shots where you fly around doing super fast build mode.
0,lol now I know I build innie doors too.
1,"With that goofy expression on the right ravager, it really reminds me of the three dragon heads meme."
0,RIP your voice towards the end
0,"Sign looks great, love the Ravagers, the different coloured glass really adds to the nature element of the game.

Go get rested Etho! Hope you feel better soon."
0,"Had a moment in YT last week. I just finished driving through BC and YT to Alaska. I was driving about 5am just north of Whitehorse and I saw something off to the side of the road in the distance. I figured it would be elk but as I approached it became horses. Four beautiful spotted wild horses at sunrise. One was a colt and they all had spots, the colt had large caramel brown spots over pearl white and they all had long white tails. I thought to myself 'is this Minecraft?'. I've seen quite a few wild horses but they always look scraggly and usually single color. This was amazing. Unfortunately they were skidish and my truck is a bit loud so I didn't get a pic. I ask the Bison blocking the road from time to time if they've seen a wild 'Etho' but they never talk."
0,Absolutely awesome build!
0,Ethos going thru puberty at 18:31 lol
0,Why was this not recommended until today
0,I think one angry one would've looked fine next to the other ones.
0,That is a really nice exterior to the ravager rush! Get well soon ❤️‍🩹 did not mind the voice going raspy 😊
0,"that sounded like ETHO AI voice at the end LOL, get well soon"
0,instead of taking off one piece of gear and putting on a different one... wouldnt swapping your chest plate and elytra do the same but only be one click?
0,"I loved the video Etho!
Editing that and hearing your own voice so bad must have been dreadful but thank you for putting in the effort and time to make such a good episode 
I hope you feel better soon and have a wonderful day 😊"
0,Feel better soon etho!
0,"I absolutely love him saying Before we wrap up here akk throughout the episode, never gets old"
0,"I feel like they need a bit more forehead 🤔 But they are awesome 😁
Speaking of llamas, get well soon Ergo!"
0,7:45 he didn't put that much effort??? I did NOT notice
0,Aw Etho!! Please rest up that voice 🥺
0,Of course Etho's base is full of secret passages. He's living up to the Kakashi skin this time
0,8:50 the blue is perfect
0,"Yes there is font size math! The stuff I know is mostly used for billboards though. Human eyes can discern a certain amount of black/white switches within a certain viewing angle before it becomes grey. From there, a couple measurements of the smaller features of your font and expected viewing distance, boom, smallest viable font size"
0,listen to the end of the video then go back to the start and the difference is crazy
0,I think nebris took over the commentary near the end there
0,Man slowly turns into Miley Cyrus.
0,maybe make the trapdoors over that right side entrance @ 2:58 blue or make a tiny fountain right there so there's some water flowage going on
0,"Rest well and feel better soon, and I hope you enjoy your time with your family! The new front to RR looks inceedibly adorable, and your base is coming along amazingly :-) A fantastic episode as usual!"
0,You should add some brown carpet or wooden pressure plates in the base especially under those item frames @ 2:10 (in addition to the green)
0,"Hahaha the developing look on the ravager was a hilarious process! love it, take care!"
2229,"Dang dude, hearing your voice slowly change was wild! The entrance looks amazing :-D I have to play it now."
0,"I hope you get/got better, but not going to lie, at some moments I had bit of a crush on your scuffed voice lol. 😳"
0,oh my gosh that final look is so good
0,Hope you get well soon bud! The sign is absolutely superb :D
0,In the last five minutes you can hear his voice getting worse lol
0,Thanks for squeezing in the episode! Had a lot of fun watching it!
0,Me when YouTube doesn't send me an upload notification for Etho: 😰
1,Snake and the rooftop ravagers are adorable! So cute! aaaaaaa
0,"24:12 Not belly buttons, I knew you were talking about Severance!"
1,"Hey Etho, i think your small base with amazing detail is nice to look at and i think you already expert on it. for the next HermitCraft Season i hope you can make a Mega Bases that very big in size and maybe not to focused on small detail but more on big scenery or bases."
1,Poor etho began to sound really sick towards the end thanks etho for battling on to give us a video hope you get better soon 😊
0,24:15 thanks for the clarification
0,What does it feel like to be so cool?
0,I feel like a blackstone Ceiling might go hard in the villager room.
0,Ravagers basically look like a villager buffalo
50,"That Rock Paper Scissors match with Cub was illuminating. I think Etho would be an amazing chess player, but would always choose to play checkers over chess because it's easier for more people to be competitive. It's not about winning, it's about the thrill of a close game"
0,I found it easier to use the light overlay mod when trying to get that light affect on the floor. I’ve been experimenting with it for the last two years and there’s a lot more freedom in it than I initially thought (especially for ceiling designs
2,"I can't find a logical reason why, but listening to Etho's cracking voice feels like some kind of special ASMR theraphy.
Maybe it's something about how all the energy has to be drained out of the sentance to be able to speak.
And there is just the laid back casual voice remaining, not the loud and clear show host voice that one tends to develop with a series."
0,"We love etho, because etho loves us."
0,New computer = new video skills
0,All that matters too me is that you have a roof 😊
0,6:17 angry birds
0,Get well soon Etho. Your videos are always so amazing and funny. 😃😃😃
0,Mad powering through power! I hope you feel better quickly buddy! Enjoy your family time!
0,Etho sounding like Docm at the end XD
0,For every single youtuber who said that they are sick I can't tell the difference.. but my god! Etho are you okay? You sound like you are dying. 😢
0,feel better etho!
0,hope you get better soon man
0,"Oh boy that voice was rough in the end 😂 never heard it that bad! Get some tea with your snacks! Was a great episode, really enjoyed watching some more build focused episode again! You are a much better builder than you give yourself credit! Especially when it comes to your knowledge of color theory"
0,Get well soon Etho!
0,Etho's buildstyle my beloved ♥️♥️♥️
0,I love how Ethos always improving himself. Looking forward to see what new editing techniques he learns.
0,"Etho's doing  time-lapse builds? What's next? Thumbnails?! 

Jokes aside, builds look great, feel better soon!!"
0,This makes me want to play with statues. Love seeing your process with how you made the ravager statues
0,"hope you feel better soon etho !!!!! lovely to see you back in hermitcraft. I LOVE the base additions, feels very comfortable, cozy, easy to get around!! for the ceiling color... maybe something brighter? like birch or even just oak could be nice. I liked the copper but it also felt kinda dark in there for the villagers

AND I LOVE that you're figuring out the flashback mod!! It's always such a treat to see how people build their builds and it was so cool to see you do that too

rest up !!! drink warm drinks!! enjoy family!!"
0,"Your poor voice. That did not sound fun, haha."
0,Get well soon buddy
651,"Usually when YouTubers say “oh I’m sick, sorry about my voice”, I can’t even tell the difference, but Etho at the end was sounding pretty sick… Hope you get better soon, loved all the progress!"
0,Friendly reminder to take care of your health!
0,<3
0,"Might be nice to have a little swamp terraforming out front. Looks awesome as is, though!"
1,Looks great Etho!
0,Ravager rush looks amazing
0,Get well soon.
0,"For the right ravager statue, you could try copying what you did for the right eye to the left eye (eyebrow and all) and it'd look like he's rolling his eyes."
0,Can you fit in something to punish anyone that might mine through the door to your villagers instead of using the correct redstone?
1,Pls you too take care. Macho-etho should be present for the upcoming life series
0,Damn I really like that ravager rush build!
0,Damn I really like that ravager rush build!
0,"Glad you showed off Flashback, that seems like fun to use! Might check it out :D"
0,I feel like there's a good opportunity to have the ravagers chill in a pool/hot tub on the roof here.
0,"You can really hear etho having to strain more as the episode goes on, thank you for your sacrifice sir! This episode was awesome!"
0,"Take care, -etho- ergo!"
0,"I used to be up in Kroger, there is a mathematically superior script size for each purpose. Things such as price vs sale vs qualifying info are all different fonts to ensure they maximize sales. Font type doesn’t matter as much, so long as it is as easy to read as possible (no flowery stuff.) Fyi - they have actually calculated what areas of the store are best for increasing sales, and can accurately (within 1-2%) guarantee sales boosts of items based on location."
0,"Regarding your question about font sizes and relationships etc.  You want to look for some good typography books.  There were a few older (pre 2000, probably pre 1990) classics that are/were considered must read for College Design students.  It seems like much of that knowledge is fading away with todays computer tools.  Back before computers there was a lot of art, research and design into What makes good fonts, and the best visual impact etc.  It is a fascinating subject to explore.  Which reminds me I should probably go visit some second hand book stores for a classic or two for myself.  Post WW2 (50's 60's 70's...) was an amazing era and even earlier.

I believe that ""The Elements of Typographic Style""  is/was considered one of the best books ever written on the topic.  IIRC I read it years ago."
1,i like the design of things you did this episode a lot.
1,Flash back is revolutionary. How is it possible?
0,You low key sounds like docm77 xD
0,"I love the interior is so fun efficient, and complete. It’s crazy what you can do in this game."
0,"Honestly, his voice made it funnier and better"
0,Get well soon etho
1,Who was that guy towards the end?
15,"Hearing ""Speaking of llamas"" again healed something in me"
0,holy moley he's turned into jevin o_o
0,"I've found that pumpkins and melons are a good villager trade, especially if you don't have an iron farm."
0,Wearing a well fitting respirator (such as an N95) can help prevent illness!
0,Feel better soon!
0,Etho's leggings look like Wilson's face with the armor trim on them :o
0,
1,rock ALWAYS wins.
1,"You should definitely try out the new resin armor trim material, I’m not big on the color orange, but the resin is still my favorite trim material."
0,Feel better soon Etho! That cold has been going around this part of the province recently for sure; seems like everyone I know has been getting a turn at it.
0,"Love all of this episode 😂 

Get well soon Etho! ❤"
0,What Etho episode isn’t a weird one? Hahahaha😂
1,It may be more beneficial to let the villagers have line of sight of each other so they can communicate and potentially give you more discounts to you.
0,Get well soon Etho. Awesome design work!
0,"Hope you feel better soon, Etho! This episode was SO fun! I love the editing, variety, hermit interaction, and your fun whimsy! The ravagers look AMAZING! Their expressions are just so cute!"
0,You can go back to your eye position with smooth flashback camera for clean transition between 3rd person view and normal gameplay
0,This episode was so fun! Actually it made it even funnier how your voice changed thourghout the episode :D
0,"Hi, Etho's Dad!
Your son is a troll! 💯🤦‍♀️"
0,"Awww Etho, I hope you feel better soon my dude. Rest your voice, don't know if you're a tea guy but some hot water with lemon juice, a bit of ginger and a touch of cayenne,  not a lot, a little goes a long way 😂  honey to sweeten. Horehound candy is also good."
49,"18:42 I always hear the canadian come out of gem whenever she says sorry but to hear it come out from etho for some reason blew my mind....don't ask me why, it just did"
25,29:18 etho's voice sounds like one of those old videos from like 2010 or smth
0,"23:30 The frog has a wicked wig :D

Speaking of llamas makes a return, yes :D
I really like the usage of Flashback, with your voice-over and a smooth camera timelapse. Making the ravagers cartoony was a great choice as you said, if it were me, I would keep the boring expression and not think too much of it, but the cartoony idea made it so much more fun! Putting them in minecarts and giving them tails is just great.
I didn't mind the voice; It felt more chill in a way, like in the past with ""ASMR"" Etho voice haha :D hope you get better though <3"

Thank you for just being there over the years, I really can't express what that's done for me personally in life (sounds cheesy but true)"
0,"Oh Etho I'm sorry you're sick. Thank you for the episode and don't worry about being super busy! Look after yourself and get better soon. Speaking of llamas! I really enjoyed the mini games you played and would love to see more of them, super quick but super funny and fun! ❤"

0,Raspy stranger
0,"Ive been following you for years now and I just want to say thank you for all you do. I have insomnia but your videos put me to sleep. I dont mean that in a bad way, they are always entertaining but i’ll throw them on as white noise. You probably wont see this but i just want to say thank you"
0,"21:08 not sure if this was intentional by Etho but that color placement is _veeerryyy interesting._ 

With the new Life series teaser drop by Grian _the colors are veerryyy coincidental._ Even more so when the order of the colors from left to right matches EXACTLY as the color arrangment in the teaser drop 👀👀✨

(Though then again, thinking about it, definitely not intentional since the ravager rush froggies is in those colors as well lol 😆)"
0,"Please don’t force yourself to do a video, when you're sick. Get well soon and take care of yourself!"

0,"Aww poor guy, I have the urge to make you some tea with honey^^ Hope you feel better now.
I really love the functionality of the base. Sometimes I wonder if your home looks like this too. With laundry shutes and hidden doors and stuffs."
1,"Etho, the horns come off the side of their head, not out of the front :) It’ll look less like aliens and more like ravagers"
0,Do a pixel art villager head in the ravenger coulourskeem

0,you had a lovely sexy voice but by the end.. your poor throat.. Rest up man.. take care
1,"For the villager trading room, make it and amethyst cove with lights and decorations. Hahaha"

0,"Testificates thrive in a 1x2 dirt, cobble & granite existence"

0,dont forget doc has a pretty good shop for seeing trims lol
0,"Etho, at the end your voice sounded like DOCM, i was confused for a moment."
1,Etho yay🎉
0,I think if you put a hopper minecart into the mud block it would fix the problem of the shulker box from flying out.
0,The ravagers need more forehead
1,"I know a lot of youtubers are very conscious of their voice, but I litterally don't care. Great episode as always, thanks!"

0,Awesome with the new mod!
0,thanks for rushing this out for us etho! :') get well soon and hope you have a great time with your family!!

0,"Honestly, Ravager Rush is my favourite shop of the season."

0,Oh no. Is Etho ok? He sounds depressed. XD
0,"For me, the Etho look is just the diamond slippers!

I forget, what was the reason he started using a helmet and pants?"
0,"amazing episode, i love Etho's style as always, buuuut
for the ravager's heads i think darker nose would be more matching"
1,"no one:
etho: speaking of llamas"
0,"aww i hope you feel better soon!! You've given a lot of inspiration to me as far as little things i can do to make things in my builds feel alive, though I'm such a dingus I haven't figured out how to make the storage mechanics work lmao the behind the scenes of freecam mod is very cool since I don't use it and have always wondered vaguely how it works."
0,the etho lore has been crazy latley. and oh hi bdubs
1,Towards the end of the video I was getting major old school Etho vibes with the sick voice. Had to change the video to 480p for the full effect
0,"Those cuts from flashback to your detached camera to your first-person view frp, 34:30-35:15 are so fluid. I LOVE seeing this kind of behind the scenes stuff, it's so fascinating. I had to watch it back to see what happened because I had no idea how we got to your first-person viewpoint. 

Sorry about your voice, yeowch. You still sound plenty clear but I can sympathetically feel how sore your throat is! Feel better soon Etho."
0,You sound like American keralis lmaoo
0,"Making the ""rush"" in the sign out of something like mangrove to really make it stand would make the sign bigger impact i think, but it looks great either way"
0,Really cool shop. The playback also works well to showcase those off camera moments sometimes. Hope you get better soon!
0,"yayyy, I got my snacks!"
0,"Not only is there math, there's artists and teams of people"
1,I can't believe you gave a ravager the Dreamworks face.
0,So exited to watch this
0,"the base is turning out so nicely, i love the use of contrasting vibrant colors that create harmony! get well soon Etho, when I get really desperate I chug some honey and pickled onions :’)"
0,I’m watching on black and white color profile. It’s absolutely perfect
0,Get well soon!
0,thanks for recording despite being sick! It was a super enjoyable video :D
0,"Etho, have you played the game The Bazaar? It seems like it would be right up your alley"
0,Feel better soon Etho!
0,"Love the video as always, hope ya get well soon!"
0,He sounds like Sadness from Inside Out
0,"Honestly. I like the OG Etho building montage. However, glad to see he’s trying new things. Rock always wins."
0,i think iron trim would look better with your skin :)
0,"Take care Etho, hopefully you feel better soon! Thank you for the episode :)"
1,"have a frog mid jump, legs extended, above the ravanger's head"
1,Speaking of llamas.... I meant to ask you what you play thru the amp that was in the bottom of your desk in the pic you posted a couple of weeks ago....???
1,This might be doc talking using etho’s account
2,the raspy etho voice is soo 🥺
1,"What you should do to feel better is get you some tea with honey and lemon, and whatever you do don’t go moving any refrigerators."
0,Feel better Etho!
0,"Yes! Speaking of llamas, Etho is back!"
0,great that Nebris filled in the end
1,The last 5 mins is just doc if he had a canadian accent 😅
0,"This was such a great episode! Get well soon, Etho."
0,Hope you get lots of rest and feel better soon
0,"Dear etho, i hope you'll get better soon. I really enjoy your video and am grateful for the amall ""behind the scenes"" moment. 

Your sign is fantastic and the ravagers are really funny to look at. Keep the good work up and don't worry because of too much time between videos. 

Greetings from germany 👋"
0,Was slightly hoping for Etho to put some eyes on the big Ravager Rush door and make it look like a giant frog. I like what you did more though!
0,"Honestly, all i could think of was that one bit of Etho getting frustrated by the comments about his voice changes from way back when, and the derpy ""I hope Etho's okay.""    Rest up man, was a fun episode."
0,"Etho, using Flashback???

No way!
Revolutionary!!! 
😆"
13,"Hey Etho: for the front, you could add a simple, upright tree on either side to frame the building. It’s a common trick in landscaping, especially with cedar trees. As a bonus, trees visually blend into the background and keep the attention on the sign."
0,It’s a good day. Etho has posted
0,Get well soon!
0,"love your building style, it's always so creative ^^ get well soon etho!!"
0,really liked the base and how the ravager rush ended up. get well soon :)
0,"it was a fun episode, got things done and showed us some thinking behind the scenes!"

2,"Yay, perfect to watch while eating breakfast before work!"
0,Rest your vocals and hope you get better
1,"Not going to lie, the husky voice adds something! 😳"
0,"awe etho, please rest up king! hopefully you get better soon :D"
0,15 years of watching Etho. Multiple times he's gotten sick. But he has never turned into Barry White before. Haha
0,"Oh for goodness sake, Etho, rest your weary larynx"
0,Nice
0,"Thank you so much Etho for the video today, I needed this."
0,loved it!!
0,"Etho man you sound like you’re dying, go to bed dude"
0,Feel better soon Etho 💛
0,Poor Etho. I hope you get feeling better. I love how you built the sign. That is really nice. I've sure been enjoying Etho lore on streams. I'm happy when you come to visit.
0,have the eyes look at the door! great vid <3
0,hi etho
0,Etho why are you always unable to record when you have guests staying at your place for extended periods? Can't they just cope with (enjoy) the sound of your voice?
0,the occasional etho thumbnail that's on purpose are always fire
0,"as a big forehead girlie, I felt it personally when etho said the ravager is mostly forehead T-T"
0,"The facade to Ravager Rush looks fantastic! The mouths being different colors is bothering me though, I'd change all 3 to dark grey."
0,Thanks for the video even with all you’ve got going on! Take it E-Z Shady E ❤
0,"I love flashback, ive used it so much in my videos"
0,Maybe something with Amethyst blocks for the villager room.
0,You sound like a totally different person when your voice is really bad 😊
0,8:20 i feel some kind of bright yellow block would go well here fir the ceiling
1,"For the villager room ceiling - it seems like you've been enjoying your quirky redstone gizmos, you could try hooking the ceiling up to the day/night sensor and change the ceiling to match the sky. Maybe skulk blocks for nighttime/some hidden lighting on a blue ceiling for daytime. It would certainly need some extra room though!

Also wanted to say! If you enjoy small, easy puzzle games I recently started playing Colorma (a mobile game) where you place colors like a jigsaw puzzle to create different types of gradients. I have no affiliation with the game, but the color theory of it all seems right up your alley. Hope you get to feeling better and have a nice week"
0,:O
0,ETHO!!!
0,I would consider switching the two outside ravagers. I think their expressions would be much more cohesive that way
37,"The commitment to not building a roof if there is any other viable option is one of the most quintessentially Etho things ever, and I appreciate that about him."
0,This was actually a great episode
0,The silenced armor trim is cool imo
0,Anyone else have he 3 ravagers remind them of the 3 dragon meme?
0,"Thanks for the video, get well soon :]"
0,"You did awesome! Love the new front for ravager rush. 

Sorry you are sick!! I hope you feel better soon!"
0,"Get well soon, Etho! 🍜☕💐"
0,"get well soon, etho"
0,"Wow! I absolutely love the color pallet of your base, I see what you're doing. Keep up the amazing work Etho!"
0,Most entertaining game of rock/paper/scissors I've ever seen.
8,"I actually love seeing the behind the scenes stuff.  Also if you decide the color of the Ravagers are not quite right or want to add more color variation between the three you might try some of the various terracotta blocks, those add a surprisingly vast array of the desaturated browns and greys that get overlooked."
0,"Please give some rest, Etho 💐"
0,"Hope you're feeling better, Etho. I doubt anyone minds the ravaged voice, but healthy is better, of course. Ravager Rush's exterior now looks fantastic. I'm really appreciative of the colored glass behind the letters. It really makes it pop more. The ravagers are adorable, too."
0,Are the llamas in the room with us?
0,"Thanks for the video, Etho! Enjoy your family time!"
0,i be kicking my feet and giggling when user ethoslab uploads a video
1,"Hey Etho! I know it's not Minecraft per se, but I just wanted to say I've loved seeing your appearances in REPO with Gem and everybody on her vods! It's such a fun little change of pace. Would love to see your pov from that game one of these days, of course, even if it's just an uncut recording"
0,love the ravager statues

0,etho the goat
0,Please dont push yourself Mr Ergo! Hopefully you feel better and gave a good time with family!
0,LOVE the ravager rush exterior 😁
0,"I dont know why but ""speaking of llamas!"" is absolutely sending me everytime 😂😂"
0,"Hey Etho. Do you get the same treatment from people in real life as you do from people in the Minecraft community. Like ""aww man, the hermits would have loved that idea"" or ""the people on YouTube would have been way happier to see me"". Ya know, since way always fangirl over you"
0,Love the interior! hope you feel better soon ! :)
0,brotherman please take care of yourself
0,"Speaking of llamas, thanks for the video Etho."
0,Who knew we needed husky voiced Etho?! Hope you feel better soon and I hope all your family visits go well. Take care ❤  P.S. Love the new sign and the cartoony ravagers!

1,raspy Etho lowkey sounds like Doc
0,"Love every video, but get some rest"
0,"if you closely look at the front of ravager rush, it looks like the wardens head with open mouth!"

2,"Once again Mojang making an overcomplicated nerf to a feature the community used extensively instead of buffing the alternatives or providing any kind of reward to make up for it. 

Talking about the villager trades."
0,Great job on the building!! Hope you feel better soon 😂
2,They say Etho turned into sand immediately after recording this
1,"Hey Etho! You haven’t mentioned programming in a long time — is that something you still do? I’ve been watching your videos for years, and now I’m a programmer myself! Lately I’ve been playing around with Stride and was curious if you’ve ever checked it out."
1,The parking lights look a little off lol
0,Oh my balls
1,Etho hates finishing builds so much he got sick :(
0,A video where Etho sounds sexier as it goes on. SIGN ME UP
0,Emerald blocks for the ceiling in the trading hall might work as they seem to glow brighter than other blocks so it will look brighter and draw the eye up
0,"Thanks for releasing a video even if you were sick the whole time :D

They're always great. Like Gem. Gem is great."
2,"10:08 for this problem if you use a powdered snow block instead of the cyan terracotta, it will break the shulker box but because powdered snow is not solid the shulker box ends up inside the powdered snow instead of popping up."
0,"Hi Etho! The Ravager Rush exterior is so cute and fun! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to post a video for us, especially when you’re busy AND sick! Make sure to get plenty of rest. Hope everything goes well :)"
0,just beauty
0,Still liked the episode! Hope you feel better!
0,"i really love the ravagers, theyre so cartoony!"
0,Thanks for a wonderful new video etho!
1,Etho: The horns coming out on the side of the head. Also etho: proceeding to let them come out from the front of the head. xdd
0,"Duuuuuuude, rest that voice! But thank you for the video, your community loves you! <3 Those ravagers came out so expressive, I really enjoyed the design and how you go through your process matching colors and palettes."
0,"Interiors are awesome (the clock ! the colors !), and the entrance of the game is really cool (fits very well with that hermit's spirit).
The title of the video... xD Very nice xD
Suggestions for ravager statues :
- Maybe 7x7, to make them bigger than the frog ones ?
- Horns on the side of the head (would make them 7x5) ?
- Both previous ideas (9x7) ?
- One broken horn ?
- One horn with some other angle ?"
0,"Rest up Etho, get yourself some tea lol"

0,"The playback stuff is really cool! Hope to see more experimentation with it in the future.  Great video as always, keep up the good work!"
0,"Speaking of llamas, thanks for the episode Etho!"
0,"catch this video after scars stream, seems half the server is sick lol"
0,Enjoy the time with your family Etho!
0,I appreciate the tweaks to make villagers more of a way to get specific low-volume things. I feel like villagers should be a bad way to get anything farmable.
0,surprise surprise etho chose the green one XD
1,"After watching scar's stream today I just *have* to suggest some elderberry syrup, maybe a little light trampoline jumping, the occasional twiddling of the thumbs, a few snow angels - I sure that'll do the trick to heal you right up. ;) Okay but seriously don't record if you're feeling too bad! We can wait, we're used to it lol"
0,"oh my god.. i’m trying so hard not to get flustered over the raspy voice because i’m going through the same thing with a sickness bug also, but then i also remember i’m 26 now and not some weird 12 year old so it’s not crazy for me to be flustered, lmao. i see where my partner comes from when she says my sick voice gets her flustered, lol.
seriously though, get well soon etho, thankyou for making my life better over the last decade or so. ♡"
0,Now the Fishing rod arena for fight club is the only we need to solve for now
0,Why don’t the hermits use the minimal armor mod? So they can be geared up but still show their skins.
0,"Etho Lore Drop: He has an innie bellybutton because it's more practical for redstone purposes. /j 😂❤

Speaking of llamas (lol, my handle on most things includes Llama so I perked my head up 😊), the entrance for RR looks really great now, it looks a lot more complete and very fun 👍 Nicely done!

You do sound pretty hoarse- thank you for still putting out a video for us anyway in spite of being sick, and I hope you feel better soon and enjoy the time with your family! ❤"
0,"Lovely video from the equally amazing Etho, thx man love your vids ❤😅"
5,Hope you feel better soon Etho! The Ravager Rush Build looks so fun and good! ❤😁

92,"2:59 you’re selling yourself short man, I don’t know what art background you have if any, but you really seem to understand color theory. Like really understand it well. Not only that but you know how to apply it. That’s not easy."
3,this video brought me back to your older videos! Probably because you didnt have as much time but also the raspy voice was just really funny but hope you get better!  One of my favorites recently.
0,The ravagers are immensely cute. This episode was another demonstration of the many talents of Mr. Slab ❤
0,I bet changing the color of the speedy lines on the ravager rush sign would make the words more legible.  From sandstone to something darker like jungle plank or mud brick
0,"Etho and Joel sick at the same time? A likely story. My theory is that Etho and Joel are the same person, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They have never been in the same place at the same time. Lizzie has only ever seen him in Joel form; I imagine that is because she would not recognize the Etho form, and moreover Etho's instincts kick in and cause him to quickly return to Canada every time he transforms back."
0,Feel better soon!
0,3:59 speaking of llamas reference omg!!!! who remembers lol
0,Honey with green grog lights behind it for the ceiling in your villager trailer
0,This episode is still very enjoyable even when you're sick. Hope you get better soon though.
0,Also etho please get sponsors and put them in videos idc you deserve more money for all this stuff
4,That illness is nearly taking him back to early days Etho lol. I don't mind at all. It doesn't limit your brilliance and thank you for sticking with it to crank out an episode for us.
0,"Love the 'secret' little detail with the carts & tracks underneath the ravagers on the sign, what a cool way to make the roof more interesting!"
0,looove all the cutesy secret knickknacks and passageways hidden around this base. kakashi the carpenter.
0,Etho if you do modded series again please include aether if not then okay but I’d like to see you play with that stuff it seems like your vibe
1,31:38 I think the big reason why it looks like an Illager more than like a ravager is that the forehead is too small. You should go harder on the forehead!
0,"Holy crap, I am absolutely in love with those Ravager faces, just the silliest creatures in the world! XD <3"

0,even etho is teasing life series
0,"Aww man I hope your voice finds its way home, poor thing x)
Really like what you did with Ravager Rush, the ravagers are absolutely adorable. And (speaking of llamas) those parts of your house's interior where there's that pop of blue (particularly the stripped hyphae) are really nice, my eyes were drawn right to it (in a good way)! Very cozy interior.
Get well soon, and hope you have a good visit with family! <3"
0,"21:08 wow , what an interesting set of colors ! it makes up a traffic light !!! ._."
10,"When I saw the thumbnail, I thought to myself: ""What, Etho just made another ravager game? ...oh right, he never finished the outside."" haha.

Great episode though! Thank you for powering through your illness to make this one a reality."
5,"ergo would not be able to pass a ""dont pick green and brown color pallet"" test...

0,Love you Etho!
0,Any content is awesome content
1,"Thanks for the great video!! Glad you included Snake in the front decor, the whole time you were working on the ravages I was thinking hope Etho includes a representative of Snake the zombie. Didn't think you hold on long enough to include him. Get well soon."
2,"“One of these is a do-not-choose option” and it’s the one that I prefer lol it feels like I’ve failed Etho 😭

The title and description are absolutely perfect. Thanks for pushing through and finishing the video! Hope you feel better soon, Etho! Time for some nice warm tea 😌"
0,"Hey Etho, good to see you taking the time you need to deal with your personal life.  I know it's not a fun subject, and you'd much rather be doing pretty much anything else I imagine, but it's important to make sure to handle things right.  I'm sure you don't need to hear that, you seem like a smart and responsible guy, but I just want to put it out there in case you feel guilty about not being able to be present with your audience."
0,Poor Etho. You're voice sounds like you feel miserable. Rest up!
0,Get better soon!
35,Even Etho's family doesn't know he's Etho. Good job hiding your alter ego at yet another family gathering!
0,"No apologies needed! As always, any Etho video will always cheer me up!"
0,Is Etho okay? He just sounds super depressed this episode and I hope he’s alright.
0,I can confirm that scissors paper rock is the correct order. Thank you Cub
0,"I actually really like that he included his sick voice. 
1. it's adorable! haha
2. it humanizes him. I know I often feel like Etho is larger than life. like, some sort of Minecraft god or criptid or something. but hearing him be a little sick reminds me: He's just a guy =)
Feel better Mr. Etho-man!"
0,Does anyone else think Ethos sick voice kind of sounds like Jevin?

0,The interior looks so good!
38,"6:51 ""It's like, man, I don't wanna shovel sand""

That's because you're not a sucker Etho!"
0,watched 14 last night and was disappointed i hadnt left one for breakfast this morning- so glad this has come out
0,So for the ravager statues maybe use Pale oak log or pale oak moss for lite texture?
0,Aww when he got excited over the smiley face
0,"Thanks for making us a video even though you are super busy and sick to boot. Super cool trio of little guys. At the risk of sounding too critical, I think the ravager nose should probably be darker than the cheeks, maybe even the same colour as the the uni-brow, to be more like the model. It's fine either way, since you were going for the cartoonish look, and not some pixel accurate recreations, but I still feel like the nose could be more prominent somehow. You could maybe hint at the chains / metal teeth mouth look with some horizontal chains or armor stand magic (or even both to get the chains centered between two blocks and pushed closer against it's face). I was expecting you to pull out some kind of slabs for the uni-brow, just to overlap the eyes and go for that squinty-eyed look, but I know how much that limits your pallet. There always has to be some compromise when working in Minecraft, especially on the smaller side of things. In the end the over all composition is what counts, and they look perfect perched across that sign and making faces at you. A great homage to the classic three monkeys / gargoyles theme."

0,Absolutely AMAZING job on Ravager Rush!! 😁
0,"At 33:59 (whilst redoing the RR sign), you place the left ""speedy lines"" one block farther left than you had them. You fix this in the next shot, but I actually prefer the speedy lines to be a little bit removed from the ""RUSH"" because it's easier to read when they aren't so close to the word. 🙂"
0,Great episode as always!
0,I personally love the peek into how the video is made with the flashback. It's especially interesting because we can see you learn the software <3
0,The mischievous ravagers are so cute!
0,"I know you were wondering about what the font size to building ratio should be, but honestly because you were making your sign for a game, the font size you chose perfectly encapsulates that arcade game style that so well fits your theming."
0,Your interior is like walking through a painting!
0,14:04 cutie
0,"Always fun watching your episodes, wishing you a speedy recovery"
0,"Ooo, I like that ; )"
0,"No worries. Family time is important! Hope you feel better soon! 😊
Love the sign!!! The whole design is Awesome!!! and the Ravargers are so cute!!!"
0,Hope u feel better soon! Cool build for frogger!! I love the ravagers 😁
0,"The shop looks amazing, I love it!
A cool/funny thing could be if the frogs are looking at the centre of the door? 
I hope you feel better. :D"
0,"""Speaking of llamas"" puts a smile on my face every time!"
0,"Hey Etho! I love the sign you made for Ravager Rush, it's excellently legible, but I do have one small nitpick. I think it'd be worth trying out some different colored slabs for the racing lines, since as it stands they kind of blend into the words a bit and make the ""Rush"" part a little bit harder to read at a glance. That's it though, really enjoying your builds this season!"
6,"the voice deterioration helped make this episode shine, lol. Thanks for leaving it in!"
0,Get well soon Etho!
4,"That crunchy voice xD Voice breaking when you said ""break"" was fun... Hope you're feeling better now. Bdubs was right it's fine you sound good... xD
Speaking of llamas! Those ravagers look charming just like the frogs <3 
Adding the blue in your house is actually great or it would be too matchy matchy and with all the warm colors, adding the cool cyan lets the eye rest (cyan is one of my fave colors too so :D lol) I think the glazed terracotta is fine it's a fun little pattern not really overwhelming."
0,Etho... 😈
0,Etho with the dad voice and Bdubs with the mommy thumbs. Perfection.
0,Absolute banger of an episode dude.
0,I didn’t even read the title until halfway through and now I understand.
0,Oh my throat hurts as his voice gets worse lol hopefully it gets better fast especially with so many visitors!
0,=)  the base interior looks really neato and the ravager rush exerior has so much character its great
0,"Hey Etho. The base is looking cozy. Colours look good, keep the cyan creeper blocks. You don’t always see them and the poke of colour looks nice. I looked into it and the Gruen Transfer, also known as the Gruen Effect also applies to signs. Might be something to look into. I like how you have brought your IRL jobs into Minecraft from displays to plants. You can see your skills are well used still. Hope you are feeling better soon. 
I have been under the weather myself but I didn’t get the cool voice. Have to get back to working on the Skizzlecraft Halloween roller-coaster. I will let you know when it is finished and really to ride. Thanks for the episode and one last thing. Look into how jellyfish reproduce it is very cool and I think they might be related to coral."
0,"Feel better soon, and enjoy time with family."
0,❤❤❤
0,"The Villager area's ceiling is too dark in my opinion. I would probably lighten it up a little. Maybe try calcite with the glow lichen or something on it to keep the color profile matching.

Edit: Mad respect for keeping the voice break in. I don't LOL very often, but that got me."
2,"Thanks for being a trooper, Etho. You bring peace and joy to a lot of people."
1,Put a road down the middle of the sign with water columns! Keep up the amazing videos and I hope you feel better soon.
13,"This is admittedly the hardest ive giggled in quite a while. The slow progression of voice deterioration admittedly had me giggling xD 

At 18:30 ish you have the start where you notice his voice is sounding bad, just a slight voice crack. 26:18 its MUCH worse and it sounds painful to talk, but the sick-giggle is so cute T-T The WHOLE interaction at 26:40 and after had me beaming from ear to ear, Bdubs sounds like hes convincing himself as much as Etho xDD and then the “im scrapping this whole episode” xD Bdubs is such a friend 😭 

And then… 34:49 T-T Oh Etho, dude, I hope you take a good long time to rest up, you sound like my paternal grandfather on his last days (which is awfully morbid but scarily true 😂) if I hadn’t known i was watching Etho, i wouldnt be able to recognize you and yet you still made the video entertaining and better quality than most of youtube, which makes it all even more impressive. You, sir, are a legend. Thanks for this episode, even if you werent at 100% (or even 35% lets be real xD) you still brought joy to our hearts 😊"
1,Etho describing ravager face. Sounds like describing Bevis & Butthead
1,"I hope you get better soon, just saw you on Scar's stream. 😊 
 cool, the colors look cool."
2,"Feel better soon, Etho!"
1,"Wow, getting a video out on a crazy short timeline!  Hopefully the time away will allow you to get it back."
1,Anyone else when Etho was choosing the colors for his sign couldn't help but wonder if he was giving a hint to the new Life Series?
1,loved you it turned out fell better soon
1,"""Speaking of llamas"" 😂"
1,Get well soon Etho!
1,"Every build Etho makes is so full of life and character. The cartoony style is so fun and so Etho!

P.s. take you time with your family and rest, hope you feel better soon"
1,Don't the Ravagers need one more block of forehead?! It's 50/50 in the mob and not 50/50 in your statues. They look great nonetheless.
2,"i love all of the detail you added into the ravager rush building - all of the little bits you added to the ravager statues specifically are so fun. and the way you pushed the expression on their faces is so good.

i had a really terrible day today for reasons i won't go into so i saved this episode for after i had to go through the worst of it and i'm so glad i did - this was so healing to watch. i hope your voice improves soon! it sounds painful :<"
209,"Might just be me, but the middle ground raspy voice just after the Bdubs segment started reminding me a lot of the early days of Etho. The low pitched slightly monotone voice, just felt very familiar."
1,I hope you get to feeling better soon! Nice builds!
1,It’s a good day
1,"Etho, your episodes always bring me joy no matter how gravelly your voice is. Hope all is well for you, that you get over your cold and that you take care! Thank you for all that you do! :D"
1,"To answer your question: yes, large companies DO mathematically decide what the best place for a sign will be. Even documents about Logos alone are often tens, if not hundreds of pages long."
1,"I like the new colors in the base, very Von Sway."
1,"it looks SO GOOD!!! 
please rest up and get better! <3"
212,"""I've got a smiley face! And he's got a headband like me!"" The way my face lit up omg this is so fun

also seeing you start using more interesting tech — transitions (star wipe!), the book text overlays, freecam and now the flashback mod — is neat.

Hope you feel better soon!"
1,"For the Ravager head, why don't you make the eyes glow? Either using green frog lights, or stained glass, with frog lights behind it, maybe?

Also your voice sounds horrible!
But not enough to detract from the video. Thanks for your effort and get well soon."
0,"The trim color for the helmet should be red, to fit with the sharingan eye of your skin"
0,Thanks for showing flashback. Ive seen so many hermits use it but always wondered what it was like
0,Speaking OF llamas…
0,No trophy for go touch grass in your trophy case?
1,Feel better Etho!!! The Hermit's are blowing my mind with their building skills!!! 👍
0,"Absolutely thrilling r,p,s content"
0,Was a great episode 💕 Hope u get to feeling better soon & are enjoying the time with ur fam.
0,The frog lights on the sides of Ravager Rush... I saw it as a hand gesture and now I can't not see it.🙈
0,"Babe wake up, Etho uploaded"
43,"21:08 Red, Yellow, Green, and in the reverse order — just like the new life series trailer that came out today. This is either a neat coincidence or an incredibly subtle teaser by Etho!"
1,One day etho’s channel will be taken over by AI
0,So meta how his voice sounds more and more croaky as he's building the Ravager Rush exterior.
0,also etho rest well pleaseeee
0,"That entrance is amazing, it really gives off that pinball/arcade cabinet vibe"
0,for the prickles wall maybe brown or orange glazed terracotta might blend better in that space because it has a mixture of cyan and brown/orange
0,"The sign looks amazing and so do the ravagers, though I think they really need a darker color for the noses. Also the dark parts to the sides of the entrace look a bit like a mouth with those frog lights as teeth. :D"
0,Loved the video Etho!
0,Great episode etho!
0,At this point I wonder if Etho's family even knows he's Etho xD
0,Omg! Your voice was like someone was pinching your nose while sitting on your chest. Etho is your older siblings picking on you again? Haha
0,"For the villager room roof, why not try prismarine (especially the dark variant)? It would fit well with the blue copper but with a different texture and slightly different colour, plus you get slab and stair variants. I'd say either that or perhaps nether brick for a nice dark textured ceiling. I feel like prismarine has gotten severely overshadowed by other new blue blocks but it can still hold its own."
0,The voice change by the end is pretty wild. Surprisingly nasaly
0,"Loved the episode! Voice raspiness just adds to the personality don’t worry haha. Great segments, good transitions, enjoy your time with family!"
0,Happy :)
0,Get better soon! Loved the inclusion of my boy Snake
1,Seeing Etho build with Quartz and Cyan terracotta brought back some nostalgia even though the build had nothing in common with the old build 😭
0,Get well soon Etho😊
0,"i love your interiors, theyre so full and lived in!"
0,"Woah, the flashback mod sneak peak is SO cool! This is why we love Etho here, he’s such a real one, showing us behind the scenes."
0,Speaking of llamas I have actually forgotten how he got them to walk around sandy city like that
0,16:52 etho should play with scar and see who loses the most lol. i remember scar playing that and i think lost every round
0,This base is climbing up the list of all time Etho bases. I think it even has a chance to surpass the Monstrosity of season 7 as the best Etho Hermitcraft base ever
0,22:44  interesting colour choices. Almost reminds me of the life series colours... Interesting
0,Mangrove ceiling perhaps?
0,I think this is the closest Etho has ever come to having a completed base in Hermitcraft. Its almost uncanny.
1,Etho's voice progressively getting raspier throughout the video is so cute.
0,Get better soon Etho!
0,thanks etho
2,"I love the ""Speaking of llamas"" segue. Never gets old."
0,"Etho, you should make the ravagers mouths the same orange as that orange frog! So it looks like they've been snacking 😂"
0,"I like the ceiling in your villager room. I think it's cool with that rost gradient!
I think the copper support beams on the side are too much. if that would be a different block, then the ceiling could work better. (or maybe have that rusty feature on them too?)
And the floor looks too flat. Droping it a half slab down could already help or mimicing the shape of the ceiling and turn it into a tube? Then a secret way behind that painting would make a lot of sence too."
0,get well soon
0,"Fun fact, Companies do think about size of font!, when driving on a highway or interstate, you typically have 6-8 seconds to read a billboard. So 100% it’s a thing. Try it out next time."
0,"Thank you for the episode, Etho.  Get better!"
0,"17:02 that was a beautiful chord (dyad) on the word ""draw"" lol"
0,"I love the new entrance to Ravager Rush, it’s so perfect for the game and it’s the absolute perfect level of goofiness to bring joy to all who watch your videos! Hope you have some good ice lollies in the house to help your throat feel better."
0,Rock always wins
3,"Speaking of Llamas, hope you’re feeling better and you’re enjoying time with family! It’d be nice to see more “hit record and see what happens” videos like this. I know YouTube trends say otherwise, but those early videos were so much fun and relatable. Anyway, about those llamas…"
10,I had a huge smile on my face the whole time you were building the exterior to ravager rush! I love SO much that the ravagers are in minecarts! And that Snake is included! Looks so good!
0,"Thank you for making time for us, I love the build!"
0,The ravages in the mine carts were a really cute touch 👍 now someone please save this man dear god
0,"Hi Etho, hope you get better soon and have time to enjoy spending time with your family!
Seeing that you loved pixelmon so much I was wondering if you saw the mod cobblemon. And if yes if you ever plan on doing a series on this mod? It doesn't need to be something too serious, just as a fun filler series.
I absolutely loved when you played pixelmon and I'm not even a huge Pokemon fan.
Wishing you the best, man!"
0,Love the joke in the description asking if anyone’s found his voice. It’s always great to see Etho learning a new tool too.
2,ETHO! you're a real king for getting us an episode all the way through the end of it!!!  😭
0,8:03 Sad noises from all the viewers with singleplayer worlds.
0,Feel better Etho!
0,It would be cool if one of the frog statues at the front looked like Etho.
0,"boy, Etho's von sway has really evolved! 😱 so has the voice hahaha"
0,"8:22 hmmm I got a sneaking suspicion that there IS a secret entrence in the painting, everyone knows u have to check the 2 sides of the 2x2 painting."
2,"I have been wondering all these years why you couldn't record when your voice was sick... At last I start to understand why, but unexpectedly, the more you were struggling the more relaxing it was to hear you talk! Maybe it kind of reminded me of your first lets play episodes that had slower pace and you were speaking lower...
I'm also impressed at how interesting you made this episode, even in just a day of recording. A lot of the ideas and features you exposed were very informative and gave a good update on your progress. Maybe you managed that because you have been thinking about it for a couple days and so it wasn't all exactly improvisation.
And also wow you now got your hands on some replay recording tool! I always feel concerned whenever you acquire some trait or software (video editing software instead of just fraps, optifine zoom, freecam mod, etc) that bring you closer to what a """"mainstream youtuber"""" (can't think of a nicer term, not meant to be mean) would use. It kind of feels like when growing up in a way: things are different, usually not in a bad way, but you kinda miss the good old times when things were simpler. I am always proud of how you prove that if the content is good, you don't need to enhance it with special effects and attention catching tricks, especially when you still manage to emulate these special effects simply by overachieving the game's mechanics (exposing descriptions using wooden signs, adding background music by building a note-block symphony, smoothing transitions by locating yourself at similar positions in between a jumpcut, etc). But I can understand if you say that you are too comfortable using the same workflow for years and now want to start playing with new tools!
I really appreciate that you spent your attention to deliver this video, and wish you good luck for the upcoming days you will get through! :)"
0,thank you for getting us another episode even being busy and sick! hope you're feeling better!
0,nice vid etho
0,YAYAYA I NEW ETHO VID :3
0,"7:53 would nether brick work? Too dark? Clashes too much? Idk


PS: hope you feel better soon!"
7,"I much prefer the flashback that you did with the natural, moving around as you're talking, sharp movements. It's different and cool. Cool in a surreal or wow kind of way. I can't really think of any other way to describe it."
4,3:45 signs of appreciation <3
0,I think you should have tried top slabs in front of the eyes
0,Love the build!! You’ve grown a strong eye for design and creativity.
0,Who is this guy at the end of the video? Did Etho retire? 😂
0,Get better Etho!
0,The Ravager Rush sign looks SOOO good! Love the colors you picked
0,The Ravager Rush sign looks SOOO good! Love the colors you picked
0,Mojang should add TNT armor trim just for Etho.
0,If you placed dark oak arches in your trading area I think that would break up all the copper on the ceiling.
1055,"Honestly I gotta say I love the vibe of you in freecam while you're doing the building timelapse. A lot of building youtubers just kinda stick it on a smooth camera and then talk over it which, while it looks pretty, it doesn't really have much ""character"" to it. You actually flying around the scene and commenting on things as they happen bring a *lot* of life to the timelapse and really matches your overall style."
0,Watch the last 5 minutes of this video blindfolded and try to convince yourself  you're not on Docm77's channel
2,"The general rule for letter sizing is 1 inch in height for every 10 feet. If you're a 🏈 field away, 100 yards, then your sign should be 30 inches tall :)"
0,Miley cyrus by the end
0,"Totally random but with your new villager door, would right click equiping a chestplate wearing elytra open the door? Was wondering if the elytra coming off and chestplate going on would trigger it or if needs to be done in the inventory like you demonstrated."
0,Etho's voice almost transformed into iJevin's voice at the end.
0,Your color theory knowledge is insane and I love it so much. Always blown away by your stuff and it’s amazing how far you’ve come.
1,"Interior looking as fantastic as the exterior etho—you could try cherry leaves + stairs (maybe another transitional colour for the stairs if you don't like the copper) for the trading hall roof, since you have cherry saplings in pots in there and the new leaf animations would add some instant ambiance"
1,"Etho, your base is incredible! It looks good -- I love the variety of colors, it's so unique! -- and it has so many cool little machines! I absolutely LOVE it!"
5,"Your base is so cartoony in a wonderful way. I find the colors very harmonious.
My conscience says ""No Etho don't strain yourself to make videos while you're sick!"" but I can't lie I'm so happy you did. Made my day."
0,for the copper celing you could look back at bdubs s7 castle roof
0,Over a year on the server and he’s only at episode 15 😂 dang he’s really just moved on in life.
0,"Word on the street is if you shovel sand you're a sucker anyway, so ..."
2,"Yeah etho  think i agree, i was there for the man cave, but this is probably my favorite base you’ve build or maybe even in general. So many incredible things in a smaller confined space that doesn’t sacrifice any of your incredible artistic vision. And this IS A work of art, don’t you say otherwise. It’s a culmination of all of the skill, work, and dedication you’ve given this wonderful game/medium for a kind of art. Function, beauty, and fun, this base is."
0,Speaking of llamas… 🦙 😂
0,"Etho, I enjoyed the episode, not despite your voice, but rather because it was your voice. However you are clearly sick and should rest (at least your voice). I'm sure we'll be here waiting for you however long it takes, so don't stress!"
0,etho you are so so silly never change
0,"Poor thing! Feel better soon, Etho. This was a great video and I loved the details you put into the interior of your base. The yellow looks so good with the blue. 

Ravager Rush exterior is so amazing, too! The expressions on the ravagers are so silly. I can't wait for the world download so I can play it myself!"
0,speaking of llamas hmmm
0,"This is my favorote video of yours in a long while, as strange as that may be. Slag the algorithm, make more 1-day-progress videos I say"
0,I love how etho was able to do the multiplication very easily but had a brain fart at the addition lol
0,My father in law designs signage for those big companies short answer yes many hours go into size and height for signage
0,"For the villager trading hall roof, I would probably go with granite, jungle, or mangrove if I'm feeling bold. All of these have medium saturation and brightness, which is what I think the roof needs."
0,Etho gradually evolving into Nebris by the end lol
0,In the trading hall I’d go with dark oak planks for at least the ceiling. I’m not sure about the stair block.
0,Hooray!!!
2,"With everything going on in our country, it’s nice to take 36 to think about nothing and enjoy an etho video. a small refuge of mental wellness in a chaotic world"
0,Thanks Etho ❤
0,It looks so cool! Love love love what you made it into
0,"Your base is absolutely gorgeous! The color choice is so vibrant and exciting, and the work you put in for the faux lighting absolutely paid off. Great job!"
0,"As an Architect, in the US, each state uses a building code to distinguish the size of the signs. Yes, there are limitations to the size and how many you can put on your building. It’s pretty dumb."
12,"I think the three ravagers are just perfect for a recreation of that meme with the 3 headed dragon, where the right one is all goofy, the center is looking at the right one, judging it, and the left one is just menacing. Might be perfect to include it here, and you already got the side-looking one and would just need a goofier one :D"
1,"Hahaha awww ethos voice at the end, fantastic video man as always and don’t worry people love the sick raspy voice"
470,"13:04 “And I am very happy to tell you that, that we will eventually one day get it done”"
0,Thanks for the episode!!!
0,We got Etho for one day!!!!! Lets make the most of it
0,"Make sure you get plenty of rest now! Even if it means you are gone for longer, we will all be happier for you to be healthy!"
0,"First carti unlocks a new voice and now Etho, I like it"
0,"Hope you’re feeling better, Etho."
0,Man if his voice deteriorated anymore the video would have required subtitles.
0,"Oh etho your voice sounds painful, heal up my g"
0,Does anyone know how Etho got the Llamas to walk around Sandy City like that?
0,10/10 video as always. You got so much done despite family coming over and being sick. Get better soon!
0,change the warped wood to the cyan terracota
0,"""$30 Logitech mouse can't be beat"".  I genuinely thought he just kept the button pressed and the annoying broken double click spammed his way to victory 😂.




Jk, but it made me laugh 😅"
0,The almost-lost-voice etho triggered my 'clear throat' instinct!
0,I LOVE YOU ETHOOOO
64,"26:54 Reminds me of the moment in your LP series (it was episode 265) where you can't figure out why the hopper isn't draining, you spend a while troubleshooting, then you say ""surely it can't be that there's a lever under it,"" you check and see one there, pause, and say:
""...well, I'm scrapping this recording"" xD"
0,Etho sounds like docm at the end lol
0,get well soon etho !
0,"this video is so wholesome, i love the chill vibes"
0,"What a guy, Etho doin what he can to give us content"
1,"Feel better etho, we miss you always and appreciate you❤"
0,"Gonna be back to normal ""WITHIN A FEW WEEKS""!!?? Etho, take care of yourself better and GWS in a few days dude!! :)"
0,"Hey Etho, hope you’re going to get well soon, are you going to bring back the modded series? Huge fan btw ❤❤❤"
0,I'm sorry that you have to deal with your fathers things for so long without seemingly any time to grieve. It's been so long already and you're still dealing with it
0,"love the building content and finishing projects! small note, i think the ravager noses should definitely be a different, darker colour than the rest of the face; on the actual ravager the nose is almost as dark as the unibrow

hope you feel better soon!"
0,"If you need to figure out which armor trim is which, stop over to Docs armor trim shop!"
0,Neat 👌
0,7:36 what on earth is breach?!
0,this was a great episode
0,Speaking of llamas…
0,"Thanks Etho for suffering through this to bring us entertainment.
Get well soon."
0,"I know ""Speaking of llamas"" is prob'ly some old Etho and Beef lore, but I only know it from Milo Murphy's Law."
0,Building a froggy shop with a froggy voice? What's the issue?
0,Had me thinking you'd completed the upstairs then😂
0,"8:20
The ceiling looks good imo, but its the fully oxidized copper which stands out too much, the rest is nice.
Consider replacing the fully oxidized copper sections with some other block, I'd think polished blackstone could look good."
0,Why is raspy etho hot???
0,"loved the epsode, etho, but next time, get yourself into shape before doing it :D"
0,Seeing etho learning flashback is great.
1,"Hey Etho, I’ve never commented on the channel before I don’t think but I’ve watched you a long time and this video really helped me offset how I was feeling. I had 2 grandparents, my grandmother and great grandmother pass away recently so it was a heavy emotional blow. I hope you get to feeling better soon, thank you for having a happy and energetic tone ❤"
0,"ETHOOO, whenever you have the chance, can you release the final decked out 2 runs of burning dark? Rewatching do2 was such a blast I love the content you do. I'm just one of many subscribers, so there's no need to listen to me. ❤❤❤❤"
0,Get well soon and take your time Etho!
0,"The interior is looking good! The pops of color definitely work and gives it character it would lack if it was all the same colors. For the roof over the villagers, maybe you can add yet another color? Nobody can miss the Ravager Rush game now, it's fun and dynamic. You nailed the cartoon vibe. And now (as much as I snorted when your voice squeaked out of nowhere), go rest your voice, mister! Hope you feel better soon."
0,Sounding like Nebris towards the end there
0,froggy vibe all the way
0,"I liked Etho’s hair today, did he get a haircut?"
0,I think warped wood or dark oak could be nice for that ceiling
0,"Loved the home interior!  Those blue/green spots are a nice addition, I think.

Ravager Rush exterior is also looking good.  Those ravagers add a lot to the fun feel.

Take care of yourself, Etho!  Gargle with salt water, keep hydrated, stay rested as much as you’re able."
0,"Def did super well for being sick, I know that sick voice feeling well it's so hard to talk😢"
35,The moment you stepped back at the eyebrow temp build I giggled and knew it was perfect
2,Was admiring the little blue pattern wall when you said you didn't like it
0,Never clicked on a video this fast in my entire life
494,"6:50 Etho, have you been SHOVELLING sand!? Don't you know that's for suckers?"
0,GET WELL SOON ETHO! was still amazing to watch regardless :3 i will always be a sucker for your functional but decorative redstone in your bases.
0,"tbh i didn't even notice the ""speaking of llamas!"" thing until i looked at the comments lol"
0,Hope you get better soon.. 💚
1,"3:20 I love this trophy! It would be awesome if you could add some splash text (maybe on the sign, or the trophy itself) saying that you ""ate up all the bugs"" or something like that, as a reference to the frogs"
0,Great episode hopefully you feel better soon :) . I find for villager trades pumpkins and melons are a great option to get emeralds as I can set up a farm and have it running whenever I'm at the base
2,"etho, by the end of this video, you sound like your on your last leg, rest up that voice! so when you get back, we can all rejoice in your amazing voice!"
0,Take care of yourself.
0,"Ravager Rush remind me less of a shop and more of a carnival ride with how elaborate the theming is, I love it!"
0,The glass to paneglass works well
0,ethooooooooooooooooooooo :D
0,Purpur ceiling ❤
0,Hope you get feeling better Ethos. <3
33,12:13 Check out the armor trim shop!! I think it's docs but you can pick any template and armor (from what I remember) and that way you don't need to do too much work going through them all :)
0,great video!
0,Speaking of Llamas with no bright blue bamboo?? what is this!?
0,"I got the notification for this video while stuck at work, but I was so so happy to finish my shift and come home to watch. Sorry you haven’t been well, but the base and ravager rush are both looking great. I absolutely love the light baking you’ve been experimenting with, but I definitely understand not making it your standard given the amount of effort it takes. Thanks so much for the upload (despite the raspy voice!) it made my day."
0,have a good time with ur family and rest up when u can. we’ll see u when ur ready :)
0,i hope you feel better soon!!!! make sure to drink lots of water! the sign looks awesome and the ravagers are beautifully goofy
0,26:00 the voice sounds like someone using an etho voice changer LOL
0,Goes from chill cartoon ravager to amazing model in a minecart
0,"Thank you for the episode,Etho! You know we’d wait as long as needed for an episode, so don’t feel you need to push yourself too hard there! X"
0,"21:30 even etho is teasing the life series
and the flashback perspectives are looking so good!!!

0,Get better soon Etho :)
0,Take care of yourself. Hope you feel better soon.
0,OMG etho figuring out the freecam and speeding up is insane to me i love the progress
0,I laughed more than I should have at the ravager doing the Spock brow.
0,Omg we have GoodTimesWithRavager
0,by the end of the video etho became a whole other person
0,Speaking of Lamas: How’d he get the Lamas to walk around Sandy City like that?
0,I love your Steve-o impression Etho!
0,Hearing Etho say he likes innies 24:14 was not on my 2025 bingo list
1,The interior and ravager rush look great!
0,"that clock is quite cool etho, and the fact that it works is the best.

other than that hope that you get well soon,  at the very end your voice was really failing, but good building all in all, i do like the ravagers, the one looking to the side and down is my favourite"
0,Such a good episode. Loved the builds. Hopefully you can get sime rest and have a nice family time! The Voice reminded me of earyer episodes
31,"35:42 ""Parking lights"" ..yeah...."
0,"Get better soon Etho! Just binged Project Ozone 2 and loved it. I hope you'll consider another modded series when you get some more free time. Would love to see a long play of Gregtech New Horizons if you're up for another challenge. It has a thorough quest book, but I understand if the completionist in you would see the scale of content and not bother."
0,Regarding the Emerald door mechanism: Am I missing something or can't Etho simply hover his mouse over an armor piece and double click to open the door? (Unequip and equip again)
8,Aw man get well soon! the voice by the end was tragic - I've just recently gotten over a similar level of tragic voice syndrome so you have my deepest sympathies and TRULY hope you get better soon Etho
0,An etho video of just him trying the different trims but as like a shopping montage
0,Flashback looks useful. I have to record from my alt account using it as a camera. Was looking for something better that doesn't eat my GPU and kill my frames.
0,"Absolutely nailed the entrance, huge"
0,Did you know? You can switch between armor quicker by putting it in your hotbar with a hotbar key (1-9)
0,"Loved the episode, take care of yourself <3"
0,It's so cool to see you start using Flashback! It really is a game-changer and saves me hundreds of hours and makes my hobby much more fun.  I can't wait to see what you do with it. I hope you feel better soon :)
0,the sheer commitment hahaha
0,"I am in love with the interior of your house. Such a varied, fun, colorful style with tons of creative shapes, details and patterns. Love it."
0,Speaking of llamas
0,:)
0,Take care Etho ❤
0,"im absolutely in love with the ravager rush entrance!
hope you get better soon etho"
6,In a weird way I actually really enjoyed footage of you using flashback to fly around in the sped up timelapse.  Sort of meta.  I think that is a perspective we never get to see and it was really cool.  I would not complain if you find a way to do that sort of thing well.
0,speaking of llamas
15,"Etho you’re an absolute trooper! I love how you just persisted to make a great quality Etho episode that had me smiling all the way through it despite you being sick.
Now… Go get a Lemon Honey drink and relax before more family come and visit."
1,Been having a miserable day. Never a better time for an Etho upload :)
0,The shop looks so fun and pretty!!!!
0,those ravagers are adorable. Nailed it.
0,"26:00 we got pack-a-day Etho voice. XDDD Great episode, the ravager statues look great and I love the sign. The whole vibe is so playful and fun. hope you can rest up and get better soon. Used to work in a call center, and I know how rough it is when you have to talk for your job but you're getting over being sick."
0,"24:30  What is ethos opinion on bellybuttons? I have never wondered before, but now... snappers"
1,Toward the end you sort of sound like Jev lol
0,YAYYYY
2,"Thank you for the episode! Definitely made my day better. Loving the builds, and I am so glad we were not robbed of that Etho/Bdubs interaction. Funniest thing ever. XD"
0,"I really like the new fancy build montages Ergo! I enjoy that you want to challenge yourself on the HC videos but still keep it chill on the LP! 

also, when dat bomber man challenge pt.2 coming out? ;) am excited for your first challenge video again :) feel better soon! Hope the wildfire smoke isn’t too bad where you at!"
3,I hope you'll get better soon. Take care too!
0,"Dude, do you have that persistent cough that's going around? I've been on my butt for close to two weeks. Smoke isn't helping either. So tired  D:"
1,Great video as always. Feel better soon. Really love how you used Flashback for this video. Still feels like we are following you around (which I love) and now we get to see more of your process. Thanks for everything.
0,"Damn, I dont think I´ve ever heard Etho´s voice in such sick condition. Listen to the difference at the start vs the end of the video! 😱"
1,"The new front of RR looks so good wth. You were flying with progress in one day, nothing like a quick deadline to get the juices flowing lol. Get well soon! ❤"
0,ive been watching for years now and i think this is the sickest youve ever sounded on camera hahah feel better soon etho
1,5:35 is there a reason you can't just take off and put back on the same piece of armor really fast? why do you need to do two different ones in that pattern lol
0,Those ravagers turned out so good! Hope you get better soon.
0,"back again to say you should name your rock shop ""Rock Bought-'Em"" when you go back to it!"
1,"Such an awesome video!!!  I really love the cartoony take on the ravagers, and the goofy faces definitely give them a lot of character! I feel like with every video your building and ""style"" just get more and more artsy and impressive, it's really awesome to see. Even if you don't incorporate the ""light baking"" trick into your regular style, it's still helping with conscious colour choices which will only further other parts of your style. It also just looks really cool in this base haha. It's evident there's a good amount of care and consideration being put into colour and compositions... the front of Ravager Rush looks seriously incredible. Looks so fun and it's just filled with so much personality. Keep up the great work Etho and feel better soon!!"
0,"the little ravagers on the building are sooo cute! giving them different expressions and full bodies were definitely a good decision! the gradient/scene you did on the stained-glass background of the logo is an idea im definitely stealing, details like that really makes the whole thing even more special beyond its aesthetics.

you experimenting with the replay mod is a nice surprise and i look forward to more footage you come up with in the future!!! thank you so much for the video, i had to pause my architecture work just to focus on this LOL
 
(i actually also feel bad hearing your voice get worse as the video progresses. hope you feel better soon mr e!)"
0,Hope you feel better soon!!! Great video as always :)
0,This is so good. Just etho having fun.
0,Ethos sick voice sounds like McLovin. Js.
0,Really excited to see you embrace Flashback Etho! It is so much fun to play around with! Incredible episode as always 🤍
0,You're good stuff Etho!
0,Looks amazing Etho!  Feel better soon
0,Oh noooo Etho. XD I hope you feel better soon!
2,"I love how cosy your base interiors are! So many fun semi-secret doors! Yay Prickles and the speaking of llamas! :D
The shop design looks great, I love the behind the scenes look at both build decisions and the flashback mod!
I hope you feel better soon and have a good time with your family!"

0,"You have got to challenge X, to Cubs game. He is unbelievably fast. But u might can get him. I would love to see u 2 play it together."
0,Ravager Jockey
94,"Something I really like about Etho’s building style, (von sway if you will), is that he doesn’t shy away from using a variety of colors while still making it look great and easy on the eyes. Nice work!"
0,Feel better Etho! Make sure you get enough rest and fluids!!
0,"Etho, how did you get the llamas to walk around this episode like that?"
0,"Get well soon, Etho!"
0,"Wow, the new and improved facade for ravager rush looks amazing!"
0,"Please go get a cup of coffee, your voice deteriorating over the course of the video is funny and all but don't forget to take care of yourself! :)"
0,He got the Mumbo Jumbo pants!
0,"Hey Etho, I know you've mentioned in videos in the past that you like Stardew Valley, well there is a newish Minecraft modpack called Society Sunlit Valley. It's like Stardew in Minecraft, super cool. You should check it out!"
0,Was I the only one that thought those pink stripes on the back of the ravagers were something else? Like before he zoomed out to show the carts...😂
0,18:30
16,"Something I want to call out. I know a lot of hermits use the fly cam to look at things, and I know Etho has used it previously as well. But one thing I've gotten a little tired of hearing is ""ok folks, now I'm going to use cheaty cam..."". This is the first time (at least in a long time) that I've seen a hermit use fly cam without calling it ""cheaty"". It's so so so nice to not hear that line and to see this tool getting used like it's a normal tool that most people are aware of and not some hack that you've secretly installed against your server mates wishes.
In the past I've heard Etho talking about how hard/scary it can be for him to make changes to this channel. I like this. I really liked seeing the flashback footage as well. I think both of those are good changes that will give Etho more freedom to record things how he wants.
Personally I find I can get a better sense of where things are when a fly cam goes through a wall vs having a cut and being told ""now we are on the other side of that wall"""
0,Oh Etho! Thank you for the episode and pushing through despite the illness. Hope you recover quickly!
1,Get well soon Ergo!
0,"I can’t believe he didn’t put red stone on his armor trims. The color would match his skin, plus… he’s Etho!"
1,I can't believe Cub met both Obama and Bill Clinton!
0,Hope you feel better! And good luck with hosting family.. Thank you for the funny video and putting it out in your one day free <3
0,Excellent. Thanks for fighting through and for sharing. Hope you're better soon!
0,I love the interior of your base. A great use of colors that blend well together.(Also hope you get better soon)
0,Perfect timing! Just got off work and I'm ready for another incredible Etho video!
1,"35:20 you should maybe put some hermits on the ravagers, the winners or something I think would be quite fun to look at :D
great efforts, and hope you recover soon!"
0,I enjoyed the video
0,The voice sounds almost a little uncanny in this episode. It's like imposter etho has taken over
30,Back when i needed him most (I’ve got the big sad and etho helps distract from bad thoughts)
2,"Aww Etho, you're sounding so sick. Rest well and take your time to recover. I hope all goes well with your family."
0,In the almost decades I have been watching your videos...I have never heard your voice so rough...thanks for toughing it out for us!
1442,"Despite the time crunch and the sickness, this episode was a perfect encapsulation of what makes an Etho video great (other than of course Etho himself). He demonstrates some cool redstone concepts and how he has implemented them; walks us through his thought process on the colors in his house; has some great banter with friends; and then does a wonderful building segment where you feel involved in the process and learn a few things along the way to implement yourself. Even showing the behind the scene footage of learning the Playback system makes you as a viewer feel like you are watching something more real and achievable yet inspiring."
0,i love the fun colored walls !
1,"Etho please play Vintage Story, it is like TerraFirmaCraft but its own polished game. Got it myself like 2 weeks ago because of Gem and already have around 60 hours in my world, it is such an exciting immersive experience, feels like playing minecraft for the very first time!
Also it has been a while since we got some Cooking with Etho ^^"
0,"Etho armor trim: (helmet to boots) (Coast, Snout, Tide, Bolt)"
1,33:55 opportunity missed to have the ravagers be the three dragons meme
0,"The pants and boots on the netherite upgrade using coast, kind of look like the frogger frog faces."
0,Anyone know how he got the llamas to move around like that in sandy city?
0,Feel better soon Ergo :)
1,"oh poor etho, drink some tea!"
0,"Great episode, I hope you feel better soon, I do think that the ravengers would look better with the moved over one block onto the sides of the faces personally but they look great!"
12,"Etho.... just thank you so much for being you, and making so many awesome videos for us over the years. You are by far the only youtuber I could ever call my favorite! You have brought me so many smiles and good moments, I'm sure millions of other people feel this way too. You truly make the world a better place."
0,That grandfather clock!
0,"Thanks for the video Etho! Perfect late birthday gift 😁
Rest your voice, get some tea!"
0,YOUR BASE LOOKS AWESOME. RAVAGER RUSH TOO.
1,"The freecam building thing is pretty cool, but I like your existing small steps montage style a lot better. Always did"
0,Get well soon
0,Glad we're speaking of llamas again XD
0,"I love how the ravagers turned out! Hope you feel better soon Etho, i was sick too about a month ago and it took me a while to get my voice back."
0,"8:13

Purpur! 

A nice homage Pearl's helpful roof from earlier in the Season."
0,"I think the copper ceiling in the villager trading room in your house is fine, but maybe the floor needs to be redone and it’ll make the ceiling look better."
0,I think the Ravagers could do with a half slab or something over the nose. Maybe change the nose color to something that sticks out a bit from the rest
3,"I think this video exemplifies the reason why Etho has such a loyal fanbase, he doesn't cut out the voice cracks and bloopers and he's so unapologetically himself. There's a reason why after 10 years I still get excited when Etho posts a new video. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. Slab. <3"
0,I love the alcove with prickles in it. It's a nice accent alcove 😊
0,Feel Better Sir! Much Love!
0,I don't know you etho but I appreciate you. Been watching you since 2014
0,5:50 Cant you just right switch from elytra to chestplate with right click within a second?
0,I love ALL EthosLab videos!
0,"Stuck out of town for work on my birthday, and this pops up and just makes it all better."
0,Hope you get better soon :)
0,May the algorithm bless you
0,The goofy ravegers go so well with the goofy voice. Get well soon Etho!
5,The progression of his voice throughout the episode was slightly hilarious... hope you're having fun with your family. take care!
0,"The voice cracks me up, not gonna lie :D
Good stuff regardless"
0,"At the start of the episode I didn't understand the title. About half way through I got it... Get well soon Etho!
Also that shop is looking snazzy! I really like what you did on the roof!"
1,"Wow, Etho finally found a use for those shiny blue rocks @12:24"
0,Etho — I think you need to tweak the ravager on the left so his eyes are pointing the other way. That way itll look like it's glaring menacingly at the player as you enter the game. The the exterior will be perfect 😂
0,👍
0,The uh.. pink part of the minecart kinda looks sus. But might just be me
0,Thanks for the video!!!
0,"A rare ""Speaking of llamas"" throwback!!!"
0,Ravager Rush looks great. Hope you get well soon. You did sound kinda cool with the deep rasp voice. :P
0,👍Get well soon.👍
0,your voice sounds a little sickly are you oaky or is that the microphone?
1,That nether entrance is so cool! And the side exit that closes behind you as you leave. It’s like you made a house perfect for exiting awkward conversations as quickly as possible.
0,Thank you for taking the time and making the effort with this episode Etho <3
0,"Speaking of llamas, ""I love the rebuild"" Etho"
25,I love the “just showing the replay mod preview view while doing a small voiceover” in my option that can be fun addition to the cinematic version you can do
0,I like gravely Etho
0,"They should be looking down toward the door.  So it looks like they are skeptical of the person entering.  ""Oh get a load of this guy"""
0,"usually the saddest part of your videos is the end, today it was how sick you are. get well soon!"
0,Nice video Nebris!
1,"Oh man, the progression of your voice through out the video. Feel better soon, and thanks for powering through recording even though you didn't have to."
0,I got my snacks!
0,I love the look of your new interior :)
3,"woah both the house and ravager rush are looking so cool! editing with flashback looks so cool and snazzy, its like the new star wipe :D i hope you feel better soon!"
0,The actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
0,Hope you feel better Etho
0,👏👏👏👏👏
0,I can't believe it took me this long to realize that he's selling FROGlights at the FROGGER game. I've been thoroughly misdirected by the ravagers...
1,"Talking about Llamas, get well soon Etho 😊"
0,"I agree with Bdubs, you sound good. The only reason I don't want to hear your voice like this is because you should be resting it instead of stressing an already strained vocal tract. Hope you're well again."
0,"Hey, it’s me"
0,Listening to Etho slowly become the canadian version of Nebris over the course of the episode
0,Beatuiful BIRCH WOOD Ceiling.
0,Get well soon Etho :)
0,Get some Rest Etho
1,"Feel better, Etho!"
0,"I can hear you're sick but i can also hear that your voice has way too much compression, not sure if it's recent yt issue or your new settings . I guess i noticed something in your recent lp episode too but it wasn't so noticeable"
2,"21:09 ….life series?

im sorry i cant help it i see it everywhere"
95,"I'm a graphic designer and can confirm there IS math behind font sizes for signs. 72pt font = 1inch in real life :)

The sign looks fantastic! Love the color palette you ended up choosing"
0,Speaking of llamas
0,22:13 am I crazy or is this a life series hint? (Maybe something to do with a possible 4th life?)
2,"Classic Etho bait and switch ""did I get the upstairs finished? I'm happy to inform you that.. I haven't done the upstairs"" 😅"
0,"Sit back and relax everyone, etho posted?!"
0,I spy etho using mods of sorts! I think mouse tweaks and also the vanilla tweaks resource pack
0,This is reminding me of when me and my friend were playing rock paper scissors and I threw scissors 14 times in a row
0,"Most of Hermitcraft is sick rn 😅

Somehow contagious through pixels. Hope your voice comes back soon Etho"
0,"I really like the clock, and the fact it works is even better !"
0,Etho using Flashback wasn't on my bingo card.  I'm excited to see what he does with it!
0,"i really missed ""speaking of llamas""! forgot when the last time we heard that was but it's back strong as ever :D
get well soon Etho! i'm sick today too... in a different way, but hey, i can commiserate!"
0,"The Ravager Rush sign kind of looks like a giant mouth, with the brown columns on either side as legs. You should put the rest of a ravager head on top it would be like a throwback to decked out"
0,"Hear me out @Ethoslab, lamp lettering, for the arcade vibe."
0,great episode... but now: rest your voice please so you can make another episode soon
11,"I was curious how long I've been subscribed to Etho for,  May 17th,  2013.  I've been watching your videos for over 12 years now.  I'm 40 years old and I still enjoy watching every video.  Thanks for being awesome Etho!"
1,"great episode! the quick nether escape is such a fun idea, and I love seeing your process with designing the statues, and even the lil behind the scenes of you learning the flashback mod. get well soon! <3"
1,Feel better Etho! ❤ You sound like a completely different person by the end of the video 😂
2,Ethos voice disappearing throughout the video xD
0,"etho going ""gamer! gamer!"" needs to be a horn of the month"
1,Loved the video! Ravager rush looks like a proper featured attraction now!!!!
0,"Dang it etho, i was finally gonna start studying 😭."
0,"""and hes got a head band on! Just like me!"""
0,The contrast between his voice at the start of the episode and the end is Crazy!
1,Someone needs to make a horn of the saying at 18:30!
0,I recommend for the ravenger using slabs for the unibrow (half way on the eye and halfway off) to excentuate how large the forehead is! that and potentially making their nose out of mud!
0,Mabye tuff for the ceiling?
0,"I KNOW that ethos villager trading jingles are from an old video game, but I can't put my finger on it. I thought it was Punch Out, but it's not exact. 

It tickles my brain in a pre-2013 way"
0,"i hope you get better soon, take your time, man"
0,"Love how this season especially, your lets play base building style is very much on display. Always dug the blend of aesthetic and functionality"
0,i think mangrove planks and trapdoors could make a nice panelled ceiling for the villager room!
7,"I've been watching your old project ozone videos lately, it's astounding how much progress you've made with building over the past few years!! I teach violin lessons, and when people ask me if their kid is like talented or whatever, like if they're going to be any good, I try to explain that talent is the least part of it, it's all just layers of skills that can be learned if you have the drive and direction, it's so much more about whether you love to make progress and problem solve and you love the process of working at it. They usually don't believe me lol, and sometimes it's hard to believe it yourself when you get a lot of eye rolls for saying it, but it's absolutely true, and you're absolutely confirmation. It gives me so much confidence with perservering with things I never imagined I would be any good at, like programming, drawing, building, and redstone. I absolutely love your videos, completely inspiring."
0,5:24 is there a reason his boots don’t have throns?
9,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done
0,"Just thank you etho, have fun with your family and get well soon :)"
0,I love the ravager rush sign. Get well soon
0,The best 36 minutes of my day... maybe week... probably

0,A lot of llamas on this one
3,"Starting an Etho video feels like catching up with an old friend. 
Loved the whole intro section. And Etho starting to use Flashback? Glorious times are ahead of us 🤩
Also, hope you get well soon ❤️‍🩹"
0,Rest up Etho! Thanks for the vid
0,25:00 I always wondered what Minecraft YouTubers used to make those timelapses
1,31:44 HE MINED THE CLAY!!!
1,I just want to know does Ethos extended family know he's Ethoslab? Or is he known as the Rug Guy?
2,"I love seeing the interior of the base come together. It's reassuring to know that it's a style of building that also takes you a long time to complete. I was frustrated with my own progress because it takes forever to finish a small space.

Also very cool to see your process for designing the exterior of Ravager Rush. I think it is a good idea to put in the big elements and then design the rest of the exterior to support them instead of the other way around."
1,"As somebody who plays modded minecraft the most, that sign you made for Ravager Rush would look really good with the font blocks being vertical slabs. The slight pop out would look really good, unfortunately it's not available in vanilla."
237,"""I like innies (not talking about Bellybuttons)"" Etho, man of culture, 2025"
1,"Thanks for willing this episode out as you got sick haha. Personally I love your montages from your perspective as you build, not the free form camera sped up building you see from so many creators these days. It feels a lot less like we’re playing with you and more just like an overproduced piece of content with those “drone shot” building montages. Just a note from a big fan!"
4281,"Etho's voice slowly deteriorating is slightly hilarious, I know Bdubs is gonna have a field day with this, genuinely so impressed with how much you've got done, good luck with another busy week!"
5,"I am learning a lot about building from this episode! At 26:09 is where I noticed Etho sounding under the weather; his voice seemed normal to me until then. I wish you a swift recovery, Mr. Slab!
(Note: I accidentally sent the comment when writing the second sentence, which is why why it is edited.)"
5,"Feel better Etho! Love the content as always, been missing you. Always bring joy to my life!"
0,"I like the comentry over the replays, just a timelaps can be kind of boring."
1,"Really enjoying your journey with color, the settings seem so warm and cozy.  But fun with the splash of blues"
0,holy Jesus those ravagers r so cute😭😭
0,Get well soon etho
1,your etho voice monthly pack is ended while recording the episode
0,"Can't stop thinking about the life series that when etho showcases the 4 options of the design of the ravager rush sign, I looked at the colors and they seem a bit similar 💚💛❤️"
2,"Etho videos are like shooting stars. They are rare. But you always enjoy looking at them.

Wishing you a speedy recovery, Mr. Slab."
0,Yo Real Etho voice without Voicechanger is crazy crackly ;D
4,the new settings on the mic sounds super duper nice wowie. this video came at such a perfect time.

0,ROCK ALWAYS WINS! 🍻
25,"I think the speedy lines next to “rush” might look cool as a different color. They make it slightly harder to read “rush” and it could be a good opportunity to tie in some contrast or frame/grab attention.

Love the video as always and best of luck continuing to work through your father’s stuff.

Edit: after seeing the finalized product, it think it totally works with the same colored speed lines."
0,I NEED someone to make a time to voice deterioration graph for the video 🤣
0,Get well soon!!!
0,Hope you feel better soon.
9,etho actually turned into a ravager to record this episode! very method!

2,It's fun to see Etho learning to use a new video feature.
0,I never thought I'd see Etho using flashback
3,"im loving the usage of flashback, both the cinematic and the live shots, i barely just started using it too!"
23,35:00 THE ENTRANCE LOOKS SO CUTE NOW OMG
1202,"I love the Bdubs encouragement. Love the appearance of Bdubs in an Etho video, especially since doc is doing the voice over😊"
0,"I like the flying camera a lot, I think it will be nice compared to your usual stop and check in every once in a while, and gives more insight to the process"
0,"I’m wondering if it would be better if the dash-lines next to ”rush” were a different color, maybe quartz, just for readability.
Also I’m sorry you’re sick, hope you feel better soon!"
0,Hope ur voice is feeling better sir
0,THE VOICE CRACK that’s gonna be a horn for sure.
0,This was such a fun episode! I loved it!
0,"I genuinely love that you left the voice crack in but turned around to fly over the shopping district again lol

edit: Also get well soon, Etho!"
0,"Even sock he's making us videos, a real hero!"
10,"the latter half gave me a nostalgic feeling of the past, calmer etho talking about his projects hehe"
1,"I'm not gonna cry anymore, I've got a back-up plan! ⭐"
0,I don't think we've ever heard your voice sound so sick! I hope you feel better soon!
0,Awww the little go carts are amazing!!
0,"8:15 I like copper grates with either a wood like spruce above them (because they are see-through) or, if you want it bright, frog lights. Then you could border it with spruce stairs."
0,"Love what you’ve added; especially  with the sign and the froggie. 😊

Hope that you’re well soon!"
1,"Scar must love the new Ravager Rush, it looks like the entrance of a themed park"
8,thank you for still putting out a video even after such a busy schedule and ravaged voice!! ravager rush’s front facade looks so inviting !! 😮
0,How are you locking item frames? I NEED this for my single player!
359,I love the voice degradation as the episode goes on

Get well soon, especially before the life series ❤"

1,Effos sick voice is so cute ❤
0,"Hey Etho, you told us to remind you about Battle Bane :p"
386,"""speaking on lamas.."" never fails to make me laugh"
0,12:48 pants and boots look like frog 🐸
238,15:32 ah yes the legendary mouse on the desk reveal pic... where he has 2 of the same exact mouse that is also oriented in the exact same direction...
46,"For the ceiling above the villager room I have a few ideas; what if you switched out the upper copper (not the beams) with dark oak stairs/trapdoors and maybe a few alternating redstone lamps? It could match the dark oak end wall. Alternatively some warped planks/stairs could look cool as like a darker version of the copper being in shadow. Or, if you wanted to be crazy, cherry planks to compliment the little cherry trees in pots, though that would be obnoxious lol"
1,Maybe you could use a comination of honeycomb and other yelloworangish blocks for the trading hall roof?
0,Oh etho I feel for you and your voice. Go have some cough drops and some tea.
0,:D
1927,"Etho whenever he needs to transition to a new scene:

""Speaking of llamas!"""
2,"Poor effo get well soon ❤ 





And i find honey and cider vinegar is the BEST throat medicine maybe try it 😊"
1,I needed a reprieve from this Tuesday - and Etho sneaks in with a video.  Much appreciated! Love the details in the house and all the little contraptions that are so useful. Then we get to see Ravager Rush getting decked out!   Too much fun.   Been watching since my kiddo introduced me (back into) Minecraft years ago now.  Still always look forward to what my favorite redstoner/adventurer is up to.
4,8:14 use more copper not less! It’s almost giving sewer pipe vibe with the roof and length and you could do the rest to that theme. I like the idea of the villagers hiding in the sewers
21,I like how etho goes “speaking of llamas” for transititons
0,rock always wins!

17,"I've had a really depressing day..

Thank you Ergo for 36 minutes of entertainment and joy"
77,21:10 The Life Series tease isn't even subtle lol
2,"yes etho, ravaged voice rush"
0,The only thing missing from this episode is you showing Bdubs your daylight-sensor-clock!
3,Perfect start to the day!
4,"That lighting texturing in the floor looks really good! I've tried doing that more on my exterior walls, but that has just made me want to do that on the inside too"
0,Etho time etho time etho time
100,"I really like how even if your builds are smaller compared to the other hermits, it has so much depth in it and you take your time with each room in a way"
0,Literally nothing like an etho episode to make a rough day better <3
0,How to turn a bad day into a good day
0,"Hey Ergo, I had this great idea for a game you could make in the Hermitcraft server. You can at least consider it, I think this would fit your chaotic mindset. On top of that I build this game in survival on my server and it was a lot of fun. I called the game Warden Wave. Essentially, all players are put into an arena on top of a mountain, and down below Wardens are constantly spawning from a shrieker and every minute or so an extra Warden arrives in the arena. In theory, this can go to an infinite amount of Wardens. The players are constantly sneaking trying not to make sound, but PVP is allowed, and players can punch each other to create noise. Similar to Decked Out, pressure plates are on the ground to make it more difficult. Snow balls are dispensed randomly across the arena to allow players to distract the Wardens. And after doing some parkour you can get swift sneak pants. Also all across the arena there are many traps, like iron trapdoors and piston traps that you can use to drop Wardens far below if they chase you, but the Wardens will after a while rejoin the arena. The arena should not be too big, and at some point there will be so many Wardens, and players will be punching each other and then they will start falling, until one is left, and when the last player dies the game detects it and gives him a diamond.  Again, playing this with friends was a lot of fun, and I think this fits your style. But of course you can decide yourself. The only problem is getting rid of the Wardens..."
83,14:09 the smiley face!! I love it hahaha
0,Perfect timing. It's been a rough day and I'm exhausted. Time for snacks and Etho.
0,Another amazing video
0,today is a good day.
0,Hope you feel better Etho
0,The perfect block for the villager ceiling would be ancient debris!🔥
0,Yay thx etho
1,"Etho I made something similar to your emerald door in a multiplayer SMP with my friends, couldn't you just have your chest plate out and double click right click, since they made it so that it switches with your elytra?"
5,"The base reminds me of a ninja’s house in a manga I used to read with all the secret entrances and exits from tight hidden space, how fitting"
0,Love the interior! looks colorful without it being overwhelming :)
0,Good to hear from you again ✌🏻 You plan on posting some of your among us POV’s sometime again? Really enjoyed your pov’s and its so much fun to rewatch the among us sessions from all perspectives 😊
0,I've been looking forward to this so much!!
0,What is the sculk sensor circuit for your villager entrance?
0,had my tab muted and I saw the lost voice thing and thought you were just doing an insane bit of an entirely silent episode mime-style
0,Etho!
0,"Etho this was absolutely perfect timing
Hope you feel better soon, take some time to rest up ❤"
215,I love all the secrets in the house. It’s the kind of house a ninja would build so he can disappear into the walls at any moment.
0,I SEE! I CLICK!
84,"3:59 We were NOT speaking of llamas, and we continued to not speak of llamas afterward!"
11,It’s a bit complicated but you can ensure the boxes fall in the hoppers if you 0 tick push a block with a top surface like a trapdoor to break the box
0,Yuuuus
0,"“I don’t wanna shovel sand” well yeah, Ergo. Shovelling sand is for suckers"
87,"I like the portrait. It’s like “okay nosy neighbor, time for you to leave now” lmao"
61,This guy's house in Minecraft has so many gimmicks and is so packed and creative I love it!
0,I decided to watch a hermit video of etho tonight cuz i got nothin else to do lol and his husband *cough* *cough* joel *cough* is not available cuz he's sick
0,"I wonder if doing YouTube for well over a decade has allowed Etho to bypass voice loss when sick? I don't think he sounds any different.

I know a guy who worked radio for years and years and years before he moved to where I live. He got a horrible, nasty respiratory infection that, according to his doctor, should have rendered him unable to talk... but constantly using his voice made it strong, or something like that?"
0,"Speaking of llamas - Etho, how did you get them to walk around Sandy City like that? 😉"

1093,Why didnt you use a dispenser to load the water column with healing potions?
0,etho can you please play the long dark its a survial game based in canada it seems i think you really like it and its all about being alone and survival the cold canadian wilderness
0,Does anyone know what gold farm this is? I cannot find it in Etho's prior videos. Thank you
0,"Idk how u play with no leg spaces, look at those drawers ankle smashers."
0,"etho, great setup I like it but I gotta ask, what do you use the 2nd and 3rd monitors for???"
0,Seeing Etho's setup is wild. Bro has 2.6m subscribers and has some of the cheapest peripherals I've ever seen
0,"6:13 I've just noticed you have a peavey amp tucked in a shelf under your pc/ fan box thingy (sorry, idk too much about pcs lmao,) are you a guitarist?"
0,"20:10 wait a minute etho, you still have a hard drive even though you upgraded your PC??? you really should consider getting an M.2 drive. They're not expensive now."
0,etho clock is not working anymore :(
0,DID YOU BUY NEW HEADPHONES ???!?!?!?
0,God is good trust Him amen ❤
0,"I know you like to play the game vanilla. But still, I would highly recommend checking out the Nvidium fabric mod. Would work perfectly with your hardware and give an insane boost to your framerate. Also easily allowing a 32+ chunk render distance with no issues (as long as you don't run out of (V)RAM). I play with 64 chunks no issues."
0,suckers still using Windows
0,I would watch you play a super hostile map in any format. Also 1 off videos are great. You’re the reason I found don’t starve which ended up being one of my favorite games for a few years
0,"an rtx 4060 is honestly garbage to be honest Etho. a rtx 4080 is almost %50 faster and is only about %25 more, and would serve you much better going into the future. i understand your mindset is its enough for you NOW, but in the future, id recommend upgrading to a rtx xx70 or above, to get your moneys worth, just to give you an idea how bad the 4060 really is, its about the same performance as a rtx 3070 LAPTOP GPU, which is equivalent to a rtx 20800 super.... atleast when comparing benchmarks"
0,"Hey @etho, im 29yrs old now, i 1st watched your video when i was 1st year college and im still watching today! 

please notice my comment"
0,vechs made a new superhostile relatively recently and I'd love to see it played
0,I see that amp😏😉
0,"Because I was curious.. all though someone else may have also been this curious.. when you pressed F3 at 9:43 I noticed you've survived 14,530 Minecraft days... And because I'm so curious, I did math for once and calculated that you've spent 201 real world hours in this game world... Which is equivalent to 8 days, or 0.06% of your life :) 

Love you Etho! Thank you for making my days so much brighter! (Hopefully I didn't give you a pre-mid life crisis)"
0,unreal how much i learn from these videos
0,update your setup unc😭😭
0,Etho you should build a zoo in your world lol
0,Will there be a download of the map?
0,I remember watching episode 1 when I was 11-12 years old. I'm about to be 26.
0,Youtuber with 2.58mil subs using a RTX 4060. We love a humble king
0,I wish Etho would play Vintage Story
0,"14th gen i7, huh? i really hope your bios is up to date man"
0,"aww, I miss the super hostile stuff too. Team canada as well. :)"
0,Etho only  now getting with windows 11 and windows 12 will be out soon 😂
1,"Hey Etho! I'm not sure you'll see this with how old this video is, but I've been watching your LP series now for the first time, one episode a day, and I'm finally all caught up! Now i get to wait with everyone else for a new episode"
0,"Agreed, I enjoy your long form videos, have been watching on and off since ep01. you truely are an OG."
0,Etho will you be doing a world download for episode 600?? Also do you have any plans to maybe change the man cave a little with some of the new blocks
0,"Hey Etho, long time viewer here! I am curious if there is a reason you don't change the amount of allocated ram. It is something you can do easily in the Minecraft launcher settings and even changing from 4 gigs to 8 gigs can make a significant difference in high entity regions. all the best Mr Big Willy <3"
0,Mojang should add poison dart frogs to the jungle lol.
0,Its an extremely rare occurrence when Mr.Etho puts a real life picture in the videos. Did not expect that one today
0,"We love you Etho, just keep enjoying life and we shall be happy (:"
0,I'm glad you got a new pc! The frames have to feel way better than previously
0,"Man i miss the OOGE days, i rewatch those all the time lol"
0,Dude that snow on the end island is historical the fact that that snow has been in your world for years after you summoned those snow golems is incredible
0,"29:30 if they're all one tap why bother with healing II? I'm sure there's a good reason, just wondering if someone could explain."
0,6:06 etho do you play guitar?
0,"I played Legendary recently, expecting it to be brutally hard since I remember watching OOG struggle with it so much. It was surprisingly tame and easy! I think we've all developed greater minecraft skills in the over a decade since that map released."
0,"I also remember the super hostile videos and I agree that they were fun to watch!
Another thing that could be fun would be a tech mod pack playthrough, at least up to a point. Those packs can be a bit long winded but I generally like seeing your process of figuring things out and building cool stuff in the process."
0,"You're so cool Etho. Your pc set up looks so humble yet you've provided us with so much entertainment over the years. Wish I was more like you in many ways. Thank you for being a consistent bastion of comfort for me, and many others."
0,"I miss the one off videos. Those were some of my favs. Don’t get me wrong, I love everything you do, but the one offs or even the short series like Sam and Max were super enjoyable"
1,"should have gotten an X3D processor, nothing beats it for gaming."
0,Your jittery mouse movement makes more sense after seeing the mouse you use lol. I love the chill vibes of your setup.
0,"Hey Etho, I know you've mentioned in videos in the past that you like Stardew Valley, well there is a newish Minecraft modpack called Society Sunlit Valley. It's like Stardew in Minecraft, super cool. You should check it out!"
0,"today I had no other option, so I put my mic in a tissue box. it works perfect. I feel like I should be mad but its just too convenient. you win, etho, it's not unhinged at all."
0,I see you have a peavy amp there! I didn’t know you played guitar? That’s awesome! I love music too! Cheers!
0,"please dont start making brain rot garbage 4 hours cut down to 10 minutes for the mentally challenged. They dont want to watch your videos, and we dont want to watch that."
0,"If the Zombie Piglins are 1 hit from death, why do you need Instant Health 2 Potions?"
0,Just watched your Project Ozone 2 series for the first time and loved it. Have you thought about doing another modded series? If you do I hope you try out a long play like Gregtech New Horizons which has an amazing quest book and years of content.
0,💙💙💙💙💙💙
0,"Etho, could you do both? Edit the video and make it a short series like maybe 1 episode like you said or maybe up to 8. Then release the full unedited version for people that prefer that or want to also watch that?"
0,Superhostile was a blast to watch back in the day!
0,"got re-recommended this video, and now realized you said something about windows 11

etho, the problem isnt the layout, it might be annoying to move over from, but the main issue is software incompatibility and the AI-nightmare systems that cause GIGANTIC and GLARING security issues... to the point where they can basically negate any and all precautions you can take to avoid having your data be stolen or be ransomed, and even some viruses from being installed

it has to deal with copilot and the new ""recall"" feature
the first iteration of recall, released to the public, had ZERO security, it noted where EVERYTHING was (including passwords) in a plain-text file, including the content of the files (yes, those passwords). it did this so that it could more easily tell you what it could do

but, the problem is that it mainly did a lot of ""phoning home"" which meant it could be extremely suceptible to a MITM attack, where someone intercepts the packets, and given the way its designed, there is no way to even prevent such an attack, because this system works against your will and in the background, and takes rather predictable routing patterns

they say they have fixed it, but many doubt they have"
0,THE GOAT 🐐
0,I would love to see you start a new world from scratch. Would you ever do this?
0,I miss the slower content with OOGE and Team Canada. Its a shame the kids don't have attention for it anymore.
0,Hey Etho. I see that peavey amp on the shelve next to your desk. Do you play guitar or do you use it for something else?
2,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done. Hope you read this! :)
0,"can't you just remove the bottom part of the orange glass column in the middle of the drop area? that way the potions should hit all the pigmen, no?"
0,he don't miss
0,I love the super hostile series idea. I was thinking about those maps recently but couldn't remember what they were called lol. I'm really happy to hear about them again!
0,Legendary is one of my favorite etho series! Would love to see you play it again. <3
0,"You should build a simple log cabin or something around the brewing set up. Just something quick in 30 minutes to make it feel more complete, even if you only see it like twice a year. Lovely episode as always :)"
0,I think for the super hostile edit to work you might need to edit an overview with a voice over to help guide the viewer when you jump around. I've seen you do it when there's lost audio or when you forget to record a clip.
0,"Hey Etho, you talked about playing maps in this video, would you ever consider livestreaming? I feel like this form of content delivery lends itself well to this style of playing Minecraft."
0,Etho is the minecraft equivalent of outdoorboyz
1,An important note on the Super Hostile thing; a huge part of why those were so enjoyable was you playing with the other guys. You playing through one solo wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting.
1,Those CTM map videos were so awesome.
0,"I would love to watch some super hostile maps, personally would watch full playthroughs but edited now is better than no video at all.  One video for a map seems like we would miss too much (unless its a LONG video) but maybe a short series, maybe a couple wools per video"
0,Love the quilt
1,"Off the back of your comment of the day I went back and re-watched your canopy carnage LP. it's still a fun watch and really great to settle in and watch, though the map doesn't hold up at all it's so early on in MC that it still had a real sense of wonder. Not being able to sprint or have stackable food just changes the combat so so much and adds a lot of tension. 

Whilst I understand the shift to longer, more progress filled content and love your LP and hermitcraft episodes, I also miss those less editing, lower effort longer series you used to do. I realise that the lower effort stuff can tank a channel's viewership - and a second channel isn't really your style I'd image, but if they could come back in some form that would be awesome.

Specifically for CTMs, if you play legendary you should definitely play it in beta 1.7.3 if you still want it to feel brutal - the map just isn't really balanced for post adventure update even though a 1.2.5 version does exist, it's not the same. For a newer map to try, I released a map a couple of years ago called The Trials of Beldroth, so I'd personally love to see you play that one in some form :P"
0,Hey Etho could you do a house tour
0,goat etho
0,Plz do rl craft ethoooo i been watching since ep1 lp
0,"We need more Etho, you’ve got to live stream or something"
1,Should have gone ryzen
0,Hey etho. I recall you talking about being relatively physically active some time ago. Is the gym still one of your hobbies? Do you have other hobbies? I’m finding myself increasingly consumed in work and it’s becoming a little difficult to separate myself from the daily grind to support myself. How do you balance maintaining hobbies from work?
1,What about Team Canada!! With CTM maps those where golden ^^
0,"Etho, there is any chance for a modded series to come back?"
0,"ages will pass, but hopper clock will never be forgotten"
0,"I normally have bad attention span and not be able to watch videos longer than 10 minutes but somehow Etho videos are an exception, I watched the entire video through and in the end was confused that how quickly 30 minutes passed by"
0,"i havent seen you in three or four years

youre still amazing. thank you"
0,Do you still play Guitar with that peavy amp???
0,I'd love to watch another super hostile map. Go for it!

0,"Hey Etho, not sure if you would be open to it but you could live stream the super hostile map and then release a video with all the highlights."
0,Dwarves vs dragons my beloved
0,Baby come back
0,"You should take a page from RTgame's lets plays for longform gameplay, as RT does handle a lot of the smaller games he plays like that."
0,"Re superhostile maps, I remember enjoying your Legendary the most because you spent time building in it, not just clearing for the wool. Given what you said about people watching minecraft for creative ideas, this seems to track... food for thought maybe?"
0,"Also regarding the comment of the day,  I know its unlikely, but it is something you could do for members only but I do not know how exclusive videos interact with the statistics/algorithm of the channel in general if it would be viable. Of course, there are also a lot of people who simply do not have the money to spent on a channel membership and they would be locked out. So another idea would be unlisted videos (here again idk how they interact with the algorithm for your channel) and post the link on community posts."
0,"26:11 was that optifine zoom? not something i would have expected to see in the LP

ohh just FOV, I see"
0,"I'm a relatively new subscriber and just started watching through the old superhostile/ctm map series you've done, and I loved them! They're so fun to watch. And personally, the slower pace is actually one of the reasons this is my favorite channel to watch. The fast paced/short attention span/jumping around video style is harder for me to follow and keep up with. I think it would be great if you did another superhostile, even if it's only one video, but I'd gladly watch the whole entire thing too!"
0,"Hi Etho! I couldnt help but notice your amp to the right of your desk in the picture you showed off of your setup. Do you happen to play guitar or some other sort of instrument? You've always been quite skilled at making songs with noteblocks, so I've always wondered if you were a musician. I'd love to know!"
1,"Hey Etho! The world tour is coming up and I was wondering if you've ever thought of touring some of the Hermits around your world? Gem and Scar recently toured fWhip's hardcore world and it seemed like a really fun time! I know the series is singleplayer, so it might work better as a stream or recording separate from the Episode 600 world tour, but I know a lot of people would love watching it!"
0,Really really excellent video. Adore this contraption
0,Hey Etho! You should do another play through of terrafirmacraft !👀
0,"19,000 likes vs just SIXTEEN (16) dislikes on this video. That's an incredible ratio, we all love you!! <3"
0,"Is there a reason to bother making the potions Healing II? If you got the Pigmen all down to one-hit death, wouldn't a non-buffed standard Healing potion have the same effect?"
0,Nice amp
0,"You should do an episode where you show the world with shaders and a texture pack just to see how differnt it might look, just a curious thought"
1,"Hey Ergo, I would love to see you play another modded series, especially with that new setup. Let me know what you think"
0,"About your answer to the comment of the day, 
A way to keep the narrative consistent would be adding a bit of a voice over in certain parts, it could make more digestible a harsher cut, maybe?"
0,"Would you be open to streaming the super hostile maps? With no need to focus on chat ofc, but since there tends to be a lot happening durin ghtem I feel like they might be a fit?"
0,"Hi Etho, regarding your new PC, is your CPU affected by the oxidation issue that have been reported on Intel 13th and 14th gen chips?"
0,I love you ethooo
0,Ethos could have been in the Minecraft movie and we would never know it was him.
0,"Hi Etho, love your videos, And have you ever looked at Vintage story as it's similar to terra firma craft?"
0,Saw the tissue box mic. Smashed like.
0,intel lmao
0,I think an edited down adventure map would be fun! But don't take out too much! A 3+ hour video would be wonderful 🤭 I'd bring my snacks
0,Look up: I 100% “game name” it’s a whole genre on YouTube now. You could use that style for a MC map or something similar. It’s more of an edited walkthrough with lots of scripted voiceover from post production. I’m not sure it would fit your style but I’m sure u could find a way
0,"Etho I have been watching you since 13 years ago and I've grown and changed in this period, how have you grown and changed in this long time period?"
0,"Just because I haven’t seen any other comments mention it, I’m pretty sure the “projectile shoot” option on the sculk sensor will detect you throwing the splash water bottles into the system"
0,"I had my first vivid dream in quite a while last night: Etho and the other hermits had a Mario Kart double dash tournament and don't remember who won but etho waffled about the game design a lot.

Don't know what that says about me that that's what I dream about."
1,I’d never heard of an entity separator - that’s ingenious. Thanks for sharing and explaining it! So cool we’re still learning new stuff about this 15 year old game 😄
0,peavy amp you play bass etho???
0,yayyy more etho!!
0,Love that you kept the tissue box and updated us on it as well as the office tech update! Love irl etho lore
0,For how much money etho makes off of these video. I feel like his setup would be more “premium” aka mic arm.
0,Etho you deserve a nice set up :)
2,"No offense, Etho, but I'm not a number! I like older-style videos because that's the style I like. I know there aren't many of us, but if you chopped it up into a shorter video, I'd definitely be less inclined to watch.

But in the future, please do not assume that because the views are lower, that ""nobody"" likes different things...... Do you not remember the spaghetti sauce research???"
0,i would love to watch you do a vault hunters series
0,I wish Windows 11 has a Windows 10 mode
0,Separate speakers from PC on desk. Now thats retro.
0,editing things down would be fun
0,Would you consider playing Vintage Story with Gem?
0,"You can hold looting sword in offhand to get the effect, so you can still do other things with your main hand"
0,Stream the whole hostile map playthrough and pay a editor to sort through the highlights. People that enjoy long form will get the VOD. People that enjoy shorter form will get the YouTube highlight 🤌
0,Why not just stream it? It seems like the obvious solution.
0,"etho: * gets a new computer *
also etho: * still uploads in 1080p *"
0,"Hi Etho,
I get that you and your style of videos is evolving but I do not agree with your idea that you always have to make progress in an episode. Looking back you took 5 episodes to finish an overly complicated sheepfarm and people loved it :)
I get that that was a huge project at the time and this one is small in comparision (and also you already showed off automatic brewing before). But I still feel like I am being robbed of Etho content. Like you are taking forever for episodes because you have the feeling that you have to deliver a big project with a brilliant new idea every episode which results in you doing a lot of stuff off camera. Maybe this is just me imagining stuff and you are actually enjoying this content more in which case I am all for it. All I want to say is I'd also watch an episode of you polishing up the mancave or one of your obscure bases. Maybe I wouldnt love it but without 'average' videos as a baseline it's getting harder to appreciate the insane amount of creativity you offer in your videos that I love so much.

Enough rambling, thanks for the years of amazing entertainment anyways :)"
0,"Hello Etho ,what is your new monitor ?"
0,talking about your new office setup made my day <3
1,26:33 why is your mc just running on 4gb of ram??
0,I’d be interested to hear your opinion on steam OS
0,Fascinating
0,"""i have to make progress in the episodes or theyll feel empty""
Unless the editing is a huge pain, i think we'd be okay with getting 2 or 3 episodes over a week whenever you find time to film"
0,"Definitely enjoy getting to participate in the build in the first half of the episode (been missing that a little bit, haha), makes me feel like I know what's going on a bit more (and feel a bit more invested in the build as well).
As far as the adventure map, editing that much footage sounds quite time consuming, but sounds like a cool idea! As a side note, ""slow"" content seems like a good fit for a stream (or maybe a vod-style video?) and same with the one-off videos 'cause then it's more about the connection than the content."
0,Have you ever built a redstone contraption and then realized at the end you made it way too complicated and the real solution was much simpler?
0,"How do I say this nicely?  Vechs has become a significantly more controversial figure in recent years, so, idk, do with that what you will.  That said, I'd love an edited CTM video!"
0,Just found out YouTube had muted my notifications for 4 years  I thought you'd left YouTube
0,Etho you might also be able to improve the ergonomics of your monitors by raising them up slightly so you don't have to slouch when looking at them. Luv u!
0,why is there not a dropper system to put the zombie flesh back into the nether ? you will only need 1 item ? a key
0,hey etho would you be able to use snow as a way to stop the baby piglins from going in? or powdered snow
0,"Really the desk photo explains the mouse and keyboard thing so well..make sure you share that with the gang, idk why they were so confused by it!"
0,I would love a super hostile playthrough thats edited for better pacing (Legendary would be huuuuuuge) !!
1,"Etho, amazing video!!! The way you paced the creation of the potion machine and the level of explanation was perfect this episode. Walking us through the new and interesting part, while skipping through the autobrewer construction was great. I have been appreciating the big project episodes but this and the last episode was a nice change of pace. I watched this when it first came out but I am revisiting it now :D"
0,"Etho, does the Looting effect work with the sword in the offhand?
Also, old series that are Golden: Captive Minecraft. Crash Landing, Project Ozone"
0,"36:57 Etho with that bye-bye, you need to steal Joel Haver's outro in one video"
1,"Man this episode was so awesome. And we could really hear how much of a good mood you were in while filming this one. One of my favorite parts of your base in the Nether was this section today so it was great to be seeing it get some love.

Also watching you mess around with potions reminded me of the old Mindcrack days around Season #5 when you built that Automatic poison potion farm in your base on top of the dark oak forest."
0,Oh man I would love it if you revisited Legendary or did any SH style maps. I think it would be awesome to see nowadays. Please!
1,"Will you ever make another TerraFirmaCraft series? The modern remake for 1.20.1 is REALLY good and constantly blows me away with how much they have improved upon the OG version of TFC that you played back in the day, especially with assets and world gen. The biomes are so much more lifelike now with the temperature and humidity system, new animals and flora, and there are even fun new features like glass blowing. Honestly would love to see you play through this new version of TFC. Thanks again!"
0,🫀
0,"Hi ! For the superhostile series, I'm sure that you'll get a decent number of views, especially if it's ""a novelty"" for a big part of your audience. Treat it like as a Third Life series, enjoy your play and just cut out the long sections, or pick someone to do it for ya.
Edit : and don't forget, as someone said, that we enjoy your content because it's slowpaced as contrary to the other content creators"
1,Is that a guitar amp by your desk?! Do you play?
1,From what I've heard by other Minecraft-Creators the one off videos tend to do really well in comparison to series. So I would love to see how it goes and also will be enjoying the videos!
0,"Super Hostile and other maps work if they're well edited. If there's a lot of action, and it's not repetitive, you don't need to edit as much."
0,@EthosLab I think you can hold your sword in your off-hand and still get the looting effect
0,Mumboing around.... Legit.
0,"This might have been asked before but what do you do with every ""comment of the day"" after you read them? Do you have a special storage area for them or do you just chuck them in lava?"
0,"I used to watch your videos all the time, it's probably been like 10 years and I was only about 13-14 now I'm about to be 24 in a few days 🤣"
0,"remove one glass from the center column for the piglins, so that the potion coming through hits the top of the glass block below"
1,"tbh the perfect format for those super hostile maps is streaming. i know you dont really stream at all, but thats the answer"
0,fast paced edited down CTM is a fantastic idea. Would watch.
0,Terraferma season 3?
2,"Hey Etho, great video (as always)! I especially enjoyed this one because you went step by step through all the technical details. I know that you feel pressure to create faster paced videos, but I have to say, I really enjoy the ones that focus more on taking us all along through almost every step (even the little ones) of the building processes, redstone, etc., being less like a “show and tell” video. This way the video feels personal, as if we are in the game right beside you. I know that this is not the popular format nowadays, but I would guess I’m not the only one who feels this way. You explained in the video that if you do this too much, the episodes tend to feel “empty,” however, I think you could go around this simply by posting longer videos. Again, I know this doesn’t align with the meta of YouTube, but I just thought I’d mention it. Anyways, I love your videos, and I will continue to watch them, regardless of the format or the game you are playing. Keep doing what you’re doing, you’re amazing!"
0,"6:09 In my case, I gave up searching for the perfect comfortable chair and started doing one-hour sessions of Pilates or yoga before bed. It’s been two months now, and my back has improved amazingly!"
0,"instead of putting the Looting sword in the off-hand, Etho throws the healing potion and quick swaps like a pro."
0,AN ACTUAL IRL PHOTO FROM ETHO!!!
0,etho you could upload a 4 hour video of watching paint dry and i'd still watch it
0,"Hello Etho ,what is your new monitor ?"
0,"If you really want to min max content, do both by uploading the one video, and one raw recording of the playthrough.. even if it dosen't have the best dialogue a lot of people would put it on and enjoy it a lot."
0,"i found your channel through the ooge collab so i would love to see you do another super hostile map for old times sake. 

for the editing style you could make a few longer episodes. if we take legendary for example, it could be an entire intersection per video which would allow for more action while not packing so much content into a video that it becomes disorienting. i might be speaking for myself only but i know i wouldnt mind some longer episodes when it comes to a super hostile map just like how you released massive episodes for the decked out runs."
0,"Question out of ignorance: Why is Etho using this system for potion dispensing, and not just a dispenser? Is this just Etho wanting to do things different because it’s fun? Or is there a technical reason? To Etho, I love the videos, I am a long time fan! Just missed the explanation on this. Have a great day!"
0,"The 'supercut' or 'sleeptube' format for somewhat intense playthroughs works well. It also generates a good amount views and good retention if watched by the right viewers. It may also push your channel up in the algorithm. The key part about that format is either cutting in allot of details about whats happening, where your at, and what your doing, and/or adding a layer of commentary over it in select segments. Also keeping the viewers in a rollercoaster-esc state of suspension/action. It could be a cool project BUT it involves a TON of editing. I used to watch this guy 'forgelabs' on yt when he was making halo reach custom map content but now he only makes said minecraft 'supercut' videos. His channel has blown up ever since then. Anywho, it might be fun experimenting with if you would like to play through those maps and show them on yt. I think  thespiffingbrit may have some more information about how to achieve better numbers for longer form content like that."
1,is your skin kakashi
0,"Hi Etho,

At 30:00 aren't you comparing one brewing stand to four? If you had four non-chained stands, I don't see how potions/minute would be different to four chained ones.

Thanks,
-Alexandre from Ottawa"
0,"If the pigmen are down to half a heart or low health in general, why do the potions need to be level 2, wouldn't level 1 do the job?"
0,I one-off video of a hostile map sounds really fun!
0,"Hey Etho, I'm watching this while planning our next session and this got me wondering, do you play or ever wanted to play any TTRPGs?
I think you're the type of guy that have the right mindset to it, if you never played it."
0,👏👏👏👏
0,"It's worth nothing, but I agree I'd gladly watch longer, less edited content. The issue is that there are 1.5k comments at the time I'm writing this, and 240k views, and even if we assume 100% of the commenters want super hostile, that's 0.6% of viewers."
0,mad bomber challenge was awesome!
0,"Hey Etho, I'm not sure if you are in 1.21.5 yet, but there are some changes to powdered snow that might mess things up. It wrecked my farm. Have a good day."
0,I think 36 mins is the perfect spot for an episode length
0,"I can't remember the details, but they made some changes to potion AOE in the snapshots. I'm curious if that will fix the range or make things worse with the pig man farm."
0,"10:09 
this is so etho, I do this myself too, just in case something ever goes wrong you can rest assured it's not that at least"
0,"5:43
not a question
it is there"
0,@EthosLab you recently said you mainly play Indie games... have you played Core Keeper? I'd love to watch your let's play on that.
0,"I want more slow form etho content with less editing... would you consider a second channel with lower effort posts that aren't as edited and maybe a super hostile etc that could be summarized on the main channel? 

I understand you want the channel to grow and stay interesting but I'm here for you not the minecraft at this point, ive been watching for over a decade and I haven't even really played minecraft anymore for 3/4 of that time"
0,id happily pay $50 a month just to have etho have a 2nd channel for games like ark and modded terraria
0,Didnt know etho played guitar/bass
0,What was the biggest building mistake or red stone mistake where it made you almost quit or actually made you quit
0,"For the record, I enjoy watching/rewatching old playlists from OOGE and Team Canada more than the ""modern"" content on youtube. Too dense/packed for my taste. But I'm just one."
0,"I would LOVE another super hostile playthrough of any kind, though especially a full playthrough! I always loved how it would challenge you in a different way than the LP usually does."
0,You need to put some crafters there man!
0,"One thing to keep in mind Ergo, that gen of CPUs is prone to self immolation. Keep up with BIOS updates to stay safe!"
0,"Etho, is it possible to use the same downward-flowing water trick to remove some of the variability in the potions' trajectories from bobbing on the water column? The potions could still fall in from above!"
0,Awesome episode as always!
0,Me listening to Etho explaining his specs knowing well that this is the specs I will be hearing about for the next decade
0,29:06 you did NOT have to mention that was over 10 years ago... wow it feels like yesterday
0,When moded ?
0,"etho! do you think you’ll ever do anymore ctm maps with team canada? still so fun to go back and watch em, would love to see you play minecraft in a more adventure-oriented way… modded series’ and team canada really seem to hit the spot for my brain in that way. love to see whatever you do, and thanks for sticking with it all for so long. <3"
0,I would 100% watch you play a superhostile map !!!
0,"Love the idea of more one off videos! I was a massive fan of your super hostile playthroughs, so I would watch a full run though for sure, but I can totally understand it wouldn't perform well on the channel."
0,I loved your feed the beast series and really all of the modded series you’ve played
0,Win11debloat is a beautiful tool. Can customize what it removes as well
2,17:30 17 year old Mumbo would've been furious with you lol. fans would've accused mumbo of stealing this catchphrase from etho LOL
2,I would die for a super hostile series! Oh man. Give me the full 12 hours!!
1,6:02 woooah
0,"Etho! Been forever since I seen you brother, it's good to hear that voice 🤙"
0,"I remember the videos of one-off days fondly. I loved OOGE when I first started watching you and Project Ozone 2 became one of my favorite series later on. I understand your concerns about creating one-off videos in today's environment, but I think that many of your older viewers would love to see you explore other video types"
0,Do you play guitar? I noticed the amp in the tissue box picture
0,"For editing the video about the superhostile map why not play through it and then whenever you make a cut in the editing process, note the location of where you cut and then splice in you in spectator mode that you record after the fact that just zooms to the next clip if you skip alot of distance in the cut"
0,Hey Etho love all your videos. Been watching since your first world. I was wondering if you’d ever get into pixelmon again. I really enjoyed that series since I’m a Pokémon fan. Guess it  might be tough since you would need a server with other people again. But let me know your thoughts. Thank you !
0,"Etho! Now that summer is almost here, is there anything you like to do outside? Are there any games that annoy you so much that you decide to take a break and go outside at all? Thanks, you’re the best!"
89,DavyBhoyProductions here Etho. Cool to see you still using the channel icon I made 10+ years later haha hope you’re well.
0,"I understand caring about video performance because then it shows what your subscribers actually want to watch, but then again I wish you wouldn’t care so much about it because then you would just be posting what you want to post and have fun with it.

I like the long drawn out boring ones. I don’t like the really fast jumpy clipping ones all in one video. I always had a hard time watching Captain sparkles even though I really liked him, because of all of the jumping around."
0,"I watch minecraft for Etho, a slow series like super hostile is ideal. He could record in bulk then release gradually to fill the gaps between this and hermitcraft."
0,For the slower paced videos you could just livestream somewhere? Even on a different channel if you're worried about the viewership impacting your main channel? I would certainly watch that.
0,Crazy how once a few years ago you took 5-6 episodes to do something now it’s a 15 minute segment in the 30 minute episode
0,"I've been thinking about the mad bomber challenge for the last month! Funny you mention it now. I'd love to see more one-offs. I know you're not into the idea, but I bet they would perform well as shorts, and shorts main purpose is to pull in a new audience. I think the old heads will appreciate seeing the full videos and the shorts would be a a good intro to your humor and creativity for newbies."
0,"I still go back and rewatch the OOGE series at least once every two years or so. I remember being cooped up during Covid watching you, Bdubs and Guude starving to death in Starlight Caverns."
0,Day 1 of telling Etho that we have a ETHOS.lab fancy Microwave digestion system in our real life Lab at University and every time I walk past it I have to think about Etho...
0,"@35:50 Either way you want to do it, Etho, we'll enjoy it so long as you do! Part of the reason those old series were so great was because there was genuine fun and excitement. Just a thought!"
0,"Do they need to be instant health 2, wouldn’t instant health 1 suffice as they are 1 hp?"
0,Maps are far more niche than survival so it makes sense that super hostile performs worse
0,"The OOGE series is actually one of my best Youtube memories ever!! I watched the entire series 2 times(spellbound caves). An I would love to see a whole, unedited playthrough of Vechs old maps(or similar)!"
0,"Personally, I enjoy your long form content more than short form content. Generally, all long form content is better than short form. YouTube shorts suck."
0,"ANOTHER ETHO LORE DROP: 22:14

Etho says he has never stored potions in a water column.... IN MINECRAFT... meaning he does in real life!"

0,"The most important thing: is the tissue box still there? There is a universe where this box holds multiple inhabited microworlds with sentient life!

0,"I would love a new hostile/survival series.  I still watch your Crash Landing playlist or Terrafirmacraft playlist to get my fix.  But, maybe it's because i'm old now and want to feel young again."
0,"I'm totally up for more one-offs! And I personally do really enjoy the slower pace, basically unedited footage from playing the map, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much if you edit it down <3"
0,"Another one of your somehow-standard longggg-time viewers here (with a wife who doesn’t get why I haven’t played Minecraft in a decade but still watch every one of your videos). Do the one-offs! Those old maps will be so nostalgic to your fan base. Sad to think they didn’t get enough views to be worthwhile, but I’d say then just do shorter maps with less effort on your part—I think all I really need to watch one of your videos is to hear you talk about stuff you enjoy and I’m in, so no need for you to spend way too much time and effort on something. I think the longer a one-off series goes the more viewership drops off (though please NEVER use that as a reason to stop the LP, that is just a different story). Thanks, man."
0,I finally caught up with the series! Took a whole month but it's definitely worth it.
0,I'd love to see the one off videos that don't have to be tied to a series!
0,For anyone who hasn't seen the old OOGE and Team Canada CTM series do yourself a favor and go watch them rn!
0,I love the super hostile videos so much
0,yeah one you gut half of windows 11 its usable... Edit: nice 2000s PC setup
0,record time between uploads
0,Ethos set up is so funny. Dude has a like 50 year old desk and works at it every day
0,Hey Etho. You should watch Forgelabs for examples of long form Minecraft videos. He seems to make it work.
0,Bro start it from the oldest version💀
0,"Is the glowstone dust necessary?
Healing I feels like it should be enough to kill 1 hit pigmen, no? 2heart healing
Could save 25% of brewing time if I'm correct. You might've double checked and I might be in the wrong here. Also I know it's easy to make the potions better out of habit."
0,"It's only the second episode I've seen of your series and already you got a new computer. Ratings really do cash in, huh?
I usually watch people going into what they do. Not much for 'He said she said this is on brand'. I'm enjoying this vibe. Very chill <3"
0,"In regard to the consistency of your splash potions, would it be because the piglins are hopping up and down, so sometimes they hit one that’s jumping right in the trajectory of the potion?"
0,The first thing I noticed in the picture was the blanket on the office chair. I have been running that tech for a few years now but no one seems to get it
0,"I would definitely enjoy a second Etho channel where Etho just plays random games (e.g. streams with other Hermits, Super Hostile maps, SOTS-The Pit (loved this series!) and many more.)"
0,Finally!! I've been needing my Etho fix! <3
0,Omg Etho you're a guitarist???!!!
0,I was unironically invested in whether or not the box would stay as lart of the set up
0,"Now that you upgraded your pc, you could try uploading a higher resolution video. 
You could still record at whatever resolution you play at (assuming that's 1080p) but then, with the performance of your new PC export it as 4K and upload that to youtube.
It would get a higher bitrate so more detail would be kept. 
You export time would probably go back up after it just went down on the new PC and your internet connection would matter more but you could test it.

Just an idea, no pressure. 
Loving the video's for more that 10 years now"
0,"Don't ever get rid of the tissue box stand, we need to make sure it get's to a museum :) !"
0,THE PAST IS NOW
0,"honestly, I think a large part of your audience would watch almost any content you put out—whether it's longer videos or any kind of new series, e.g. with OOGE or Team Canada or something completely new. So, taking into account how financially dependent on the youtube income you are, just post whatever you have fun playing and recording.
also, whenever you're building a new redstone machine like the brewer and don't want to put it into a video on the main channel, consider doing a ""b-sides"" channel. lots of people, me included, would love to watch you through the process"
0,"I think superhostile maps would work similar to the Decked out runs at holding attention, i think they'd do better than you think"
0,"Oh that idea for maps sounds amazing, it's a lot of work I think, but I'd love to see the end result. I think one-off vidoes are quite good too because you can just get into them and won't have to think about all the setup and other stuff that a series video requires, a change of pace is always good for the old noggin."
0,Would making the overworld portal a 2-block make the potions enter more centered? (between 2 blocks -> center of the 3 block)
0,"Hearing that the potion brewer in the man cave is like 10 years or so old makes me feel so old. I remember watching that video of you making it, along with that whole area down there. I really have been watching your videos for the better half of my life. thank you for always being there etho"

0,"The windows 11 layout is probably okay, but what scares me is how little trust Microsoft has earned when it comes to privacy. With all that stuff with Recall, idt I wanna touch Windows ever again."
0,"Etho I have a question!

Redstone has changed a ton since you first became invested in it; how approachable/easily accessible is modern Redstone in your opinion? I would think that because you got into it as early as you did it’s easy to adapt to updates, but for others who are either new to the game or are just getting interested in the technical aspect of Minecraft (like me) it gets all confusing and overwhelming. Like I said it may just be a me thing but I would love to know your opinion on the scope of Redstone these days :)

Also yaaaay new setup pic! Glad to see the tissue box survived the overhaul!"

     If you want to try carefully editing down a day or 2 of playing Legendary to show highlights we'll happily watch it, but we'll adore watching slower and longer super hostile episodes. 

     I'm personally praying for an Etho teaches basic redstone mechanisms like monostable circuit with an example use 


     Ergo that computer is so pretty!!!!! Thank you for the picture!"
0,i literally just watched all the ooge videos the last 2 weeks lmao
84,"Hey Etho, tomorrow my twin brother is getting married and im going to mention getting up early to watch your videos as kids in my Best Man speech as an example of one of my happiest memories. Thank you."
0,"“I’ve never tried it before in Minecraft” 

Etho, what’s the maximum number of potions you’ve put in a bubble column in NOT Minecraft?"
0,"""Windows 11 isnt bad after you change everything"""
0,People like creative ideas yes but they also like people hanging out and having chemistry together. Another OOGE or Team Canada series would be AMAZING
0,"i've never been so hyped to continue watching a MC let's play video. 
Amazing content Etho!"
0,"Slower and more longform content I want to keep so badly. Personally I feel a disconnect between content creator and viewer gets formed when the uploads are just highlight reels of a session. We know these videos take countless hours of passion and effort and we want to feel like we're a part of as much as we can be. Shoot if I had everything my way you'd have a second channel where your predominantly unedited footage gets uploaded! Sortof like a behind the scenes thought process journey. I know it sounds massively tiresome to have your content creation brain ""turned on"" for extended time but trust me we dont need attention grabbing lines constantly - we just want a peek in on the process. Continue to be our longform hero Etho as you have been for well over a decade, I know you disapprove of the pressures the ""attention span defecit"" has created."
0,I appreciate you knowing we’re invested in your ergonomics
0,Dang hes gotten a 1460
0,I know you have to still watch your stats but I would watch it either way. 30 minute episodes or one 2 hour video. Always appreciate a new Etho video
1,Is smelting the gold swords into nuggets not worth the resources or what’s the reason for not doing it?
0,What are the current active seasons? Just hermit and let’s play right? Modded has to out at this point lol
0,You only lost 7 potions at 26:45
0,"Thank you Etho ❤ the best episode in a long time.  Old fashion, like the old days.  Feels like we are playing the game together.  Rather than just watching"
0,"Instead of a slab, could you use snow layers? Can you even put snow layers in the nether?"
1,"Hey Etho! In regards to CTM maps, I do prefer slower paced videos. It’s fun to see the build-up and I don’t think it would feel as rewarding if you finished the map in a single episode. I also think that trying to edit an entire map down into a single episode would make it hard to balance action and downtime. In your older CTM videos I always liked when you would take a break from exploring new areas and just plant trees or build a farm; the contrast between that and the action makes it interesting in my opinion.

That said, the YouTube algorithm is, as you’ve said, not really favouring that type of content… maybe a balance would be good, where instead of a single episode you finish a map in 3 or 5. You could also always create a second channel for that type of content, so it doesn’t harm the performance of your other videos (though I also understand why you might not want to)

Either way though, I would love to see you play more maps!"
0,"With those super hostile, it was also a lot of fun to see the casual humor that comes about bashing your head into a wall with your buddies for a few hours."
0,biblically accurate gold sword
0,etho has heard us!!❤️👏🏼 i cant wait to get more etho content!! it makes me so happy
0,"I would love to see a playthrough of Legendary, or any map like that"
0,"Hey Etho, why is it that the healing potions don't despawn in the overworld if it is being chunk loaded from the nether the whole time?"
0,"You were doing so well, you made the potion launcher mostly on camera and the fiddly calibration part was edited out, I think. But then you fell back onto old habits and made the potion _crafter_ off camera again, :D

I love all your series, but I do admit to nostalgia on the challenge maps or the subscriber specials. You introduced me to Matt McFarland's music with those, they still have a special place in my heart. I didn't really have much in the way of music variety back in those days, but even now I enjoy the tracks. My only concern is that there are almost too many maps and map videos now, I'm not quite sure what one would be interesting to see. I've played a lot of the modded ones and they all feel similar now - there are a lot of cool mechanics, but everyone uses the same ones.

I'm a little worried that your 14-series Intel might be at risk of the premature failures that year has become known for, but it otherwise sounds like a good machine. Still, I'm personally looking toward AMD for my next one because of that issue.

Rare pic of Etho's desk in this one. It looks haphazard, but you KNOW seeing that that it belongs to someone who knows exactly what they like and has spent a long time fine-tuning it. Even if that does result in a speaker in a very precarious corner..."
0,"0:30 -- 1460 NVIDIA -> I think he meant 4060 card
Awesome build man!"
0,"Yo Etho! There were a couple of moments in this video that made me want to leave this comment. You talking about making the video high-content and the comment of the day. I'd watch your videos even if you weren't making huge progress each time. I just enjoy watching someone play Minecraft that I've been watching since chocolate island (I'm mid 30s now!). I know it's important to make sure you're getting decent views on YT for the algo, but try not to worry too much about it or compare yourself to the more recent youtubers. Your content is great no matter what you're doing and the community rallies around it. If you're worried about the algo, consider making an “extras” channel for some more old school experimental videos. Love you work. Thanks for all the content, keep it up :)"
0,Peavey amp spotted
0,"20:10 I doubt your harddrive will care since this should be in the operating system cache at the very least.
Well, at least if your aren't RAM starved or the people who implemented this from Microsoft weren't complete idiots (and while Windows may not be the best when it comes to such things, it's very much not *that* bad)."
0,You need to turn up the ram amount that your world can use. It will help performance a ton!
0,Thank you for another great video! I for one loved the superhostile map series! I think it would lose a lot of it was just a highlight reel.
0,This blew my mind…
7,6:00 Etho do you play the guitar? I noticed the peavey amp
0,"if u want to do those maps and make content with it you will pretty much have to hire a zoomer editor and play with friends otherwise most people wont watch,  they say they will in comments but they wont"
0,"i actually rewatched those old OOGE super hostile maps while waiting for hermitcraft season 10. it was jarring at first to see the differences in minecraft, but the gameplay and silly conversations (and bdubs singing constantly?) hold up so well. i would love to see  that sort of stuff again, however its edited down"
0,I realize the youtube algorithm is a thing and you need to be picky on what you air. So why not start a second channel just to live stream the non Minecraft game you play with no worries of editing or affecting the main channel. As I would love to watch your perspective when playing among us 3D or R.E.P.O.  And no need to have a live chat as I am sure us Fan boys would just be happy to watch you play with no interactions just the joy of watching you play from your respective.
1,"I would also like to see another super hostile, they are missed. I went through a phase of watching all of them years ago and they were so good and chill. It's a shame youtube is about chasing views and the 'top of the bell curve/median' these days rather than just having fun and uploading stuff regardless. There's lots of things that were great about Minecraft but are now lost to time. UHC being another I used to enjoy but for whatever reason never happens no more. Give me that over the life series' any day.

I feel like editing a map into one video would also remove a lot of the charm and i'd personally prefer the full thing. But regardless I'd still watch it; Etho can upload anything and I'll give it a view."
0,"Hey Etho, is it possible that Terraria will ever make a return? I really enjoyed watching those series back in the day. Not sure what Zisteau is up to now, but it would be cool to see you guys play the 1.4 update."
0,So no capture the monument with team Canada :( the good old days
0,I would love for you to make a second channel that you wouldn't have to worry about how videos perform and just upload everything. I would love to see your among us perspective for example.
0,"i'd love to see you play ctm maps again . I love the slow progression they provide and in my opinion it's some of the best content you have ever put out, despite the veiws you got on it ."
0,"I think the one off videos would work great. If you have a fun idea, you'll likely enjoy making the video, and I think it would perform pretty well. A win win scenario."
0,"Etho, have you ever used Linux? If so, what did you think? Would you ever consider running it instead of Windows?"
0,"I’m not gonna lie, I’d watch Etho play Minecraft and recite the dictionary. He uploads it, I’ll watch it and be happy"
0,"Man hearing someone else reminisce about the old videos made me think of the terraria videos with Zisteau “terraria is EZ” Great times, really enjoyed those videos ;). And still making amazing content to this day, love it man. Thanks as always :)"
0,Don’t get me wrong I absolutely love watching you play Minecraft and I hope you don’t stop but have you ever thought of branching off and making videos for other games as well.  Obviously the game would be your choice but I’d love to see you make a runescape account!
0,"Hey Etho, I was curious… since you’re really the only Minecraft YouTuber I watch, is there a “meta” farm that almost all Minecrafters use? Or has redstone become so multidimensional that everyone makes their own version of farms to fit their needs?"
0,"Sir, with all due respect, who cares how a video performs? Do what you feel like doing. Have fun and the audience for that thing will find you and thank you!"
0,Congrats on the new computer Etho 🎉
0,"Would be interesting for you to do a ""statpoker"" ish game on this world and showcase ur statistics from all these years of playing"
0,"I recently hopped into Spellbound Caves the other day, and the mob light limit changes have really altered how the map plays. Still very cool, but nowhere near as hard."
0,why not lingering potions?
0,I would think the main improvement comes from the much larger L1i and L1d cache sizes on the dye
0,"I'd love to see another legendary play through, but as unedited as possible!! (Unless its going to be an edit into a full 12 hour long video)"
0,"I remember watching Etho when I was 12, now 11 years later and I still enjoy watching this awesome person and the nostalgia of time with each lets play episode is heartwarming as well, the memories just flow"
0,"About the adventure maps, you could even do a mini-series if the episode was stretching too long or if there was a good spot for ending an episode"
1,"At 5:59, that’s a guitar amp? Etho, do you play guitar?"
0,Did I see a guitar amp in that setup shot? Do you play guitar or other instruments Etho?
0,"I think a lot of the more slow form content, like the super hostile playthroughs and things like that have moved to streaming and VODs on a second channel of some kind

I’ve seen sparkles doing a lot of that stuff on streams and then just uploading the stream to YouTube on a second channel"
0,"I think your idea is pretty good for recording the maps, I would definitely give it a go and watch it 👍"
0,"Hi Etho! In the picture you showed of your desk, I spotted a Peavy amp under your PC tower! Do you play any instruments? What kind of music do you listen to?"
3,ETHO don't think I wouldn't notice you have TWO identical mice! Tell me you don't with both! 6:05
0,Nice amp
0,"OMG!!! Yes to this comment of the day! I am convalescing from a surgery and I am planning on watching them AGAIN! My favourite part is seeing the whole process failing, trying and figuring it all. Whenever I feel meh, those series are my go to.

Also, glad the Keenex box survived!"
0,I'm all for the slow paced videos. I'd happy sit through an entire playthrough of a super hostile map with no edits!
0,"Please do a super hostile type super edit!! You say Minecraft videos are about showing creativity, you could walk us thru creative problem solving on how you get thru maps!"
0,Would love to see an old style series of Legendary or any other maps from the old days. One off videos also sounds like a lot of fun!
1,"I'm working on a adventure world map, it has started to become its own game in the game you could say ^^"
1,"The effort and quality in Etho videos is amazing. As plenty of comments say, we'd genuinely enjoy any level of video, but the craftsmanship in most Etho videos is something else and doesn't go unappreciated!"
0,Are you ever going to do more modded minecraft of any kind? It's been like 2 years since your last one and I miss them
1,"Etho could upload 20, 40-minute Superhostile episodes, and we would watch every second of them!"
0,"Etho, in light of some content not performing well, would you consider making a second channel? I think that would balance out your need to keep this channel on top of the algorithm with the ability to occasionally post lower-effort long-form gameplay elsewhere. I would love to see your footage from REPO or Among Us 3D or a superhostile map, but you've talked about how tough it is for you to post anything other than MC on this channel. I think it would be fine to cobble that together with minimal editing and throw it up on a second channel for whatever adsense revenue it might collect and that wouldn't hurt your main channel. Like how the hermits use their second channels."
0,S7 was 5 yrs ago now🤯
0,"Canopy carnage was one of the first videos I seen. I loved it a lot. Today's Etho would not be able to recreate the same survival and exploration feeling, being to experienced now. Unless he learns to roleplay."
0,“Now imagine I’m a potion” love you Etho
0,"Man It’s been a minute since I rewatched legendary
Guess it’s time to revisit that again"
1,"Hey etho, if the zombie pigmen are at 1 hit, why did you brew them as instant health 2?"
0,"Might be a dumb question, but why not a lingering potion?"
0,"Doc used an item separator in his teleport stations, but didn't really explain how it works. Your explanation was great. I understand the system a lot more."
0,The tissue box is an integral part to this channel's success! Of course it's still there :D
0,"I think this is my favorite redstone episode you've done, Etho. You did a great job of explaining the concepts/ systems at play, and you combined concepts in ways that made for really amazing outcomes. Really awesome job! :)"
0,The Fact that the Peavy 1x8 fits Perfectly in the little cubby whole is great!
0,That’s no blanket! That’s a quilt!
0,"Re: the enderman farm, isn't the rocket sound the same as the throw potion sound (as heard by sculk)?"
1,"One-off goofy videos again would be absolutely wonderful etho and mixes it up for you too. Also I would absolutely watch the HECK out of an episode-by-episode play through of Legendary, holy moly that would be amazing. I still go back and rewatch OOGE regularly lol i've watched all of it like 10 times"
0,"Is it possible to reuse the mechanic that keeps bottles at a better resting position in the water column before being sent by slime block launcher? (water flowing downwards, while in a bubble column?)"
0,If you hold a looting 3 sword in your off hand will it still affect the zombie pigmen? If you were building and were switching between all a lot of blocks it might be handy.
0,etho's super old intro is so charming
0,"Hey Etho, I noticed the amp in the picture you shared of your new PC setup. (Congrats btw!) Do you play guitar or bass? If so, what kind of music do you like to play? 

I’ve owned an acoustic guitar since I was a kid, but I didn’t have the patience to commit to learning how to play it until very recently, as an adult. I feel very strongly that it’s never too late to learn new things, which is probably something that a lot of your viewers have in common.

All the best! <3"
0,my man got a new computer and a monitor but still plays at 60 fps...
0,Etho I see that peavy what are you jamming out on after recording ?!
0,Hey Ergo… you should fill in your dirt…
0,Perhaps try changing the glass block that gets hit by the splash potion with a slightly smaller block like a fence post or a chest to get it closer to the center. Could help with consistency as long as items dont get stuck on it.
0,NEW COMPUTER? LETS GO!
0,The gold and XP flying back through the portal on the first test was hilarious
0,This new computer sounds like you bought it 10 years ago. I figured you'd have a beast of a machine.
1,your video thumbnails are sooooo unique that i got happy while scrolling through my recommended because my subconcious was able to tell that was an etho thumbnail before i took a proper look
0,"Thanks for the video Etho! I agree with other commenters that I come to see what YOU are up to, not for crazy action. 

Your creativity, laid back tone, cheerful attitude, and clean content are what keep me coming back again and again.

I really ejoyed your Projet Ozone 2 content, dispite only finding the channel during Secret Life and never knowing about PO2 before that. So I can attest that some of your newer subscribers do enjoy the slower, spin-off content.

I was watching Scar's stream the other day (I see Etho I click and Scar knows it!) He was lamenting the fact that you can't hang out in real life. Do you think you would ever risk meeting the other Hermits in person?"
0,"Hey Etho! Hate to be the bearer of unfinished projects, but I'm curious if anything came out of your Wacky Pixel Display idea. I thought it was a really cool concept but I get that sometimes not all of our Minecraft ambitions comes to fruition. Would love to see it featured in something, even if it's just a display for a minigame or some storage system indicator. Thanks for keeping us entertained for so many years!"
0,"I would love a classic episodic map playthrough series, but if you want to experiment with the format i would be on board. More one offs would be cool too."
0,"Hey Etho, Your processor the intel 14700 was subject to a potentially destructive bug, that could lead to instability or permanent cpu damage/performance degradation.  Intel released a bios update september of 2024 that fixed the issue, and extended the warrenty for anyone with an affected sku.  Please make sure your bios is up to date so that you dont run into issues.  The bug affects most intel 13th and 14th desktop cpus, and your model is one of them."
0,Man i haven’t played or followed Minecraft in years but used to religiously watch Etho. Watching now is wild. I have no idea what most of this is
0,can etho still hold the looting sword in his offhand and get the effect from the potion kills?
0,I think another long form skyblock would be great. *cough* star technology *cough*
2,"Nooooo I don’t want a heavily edited cut up version of map playthroughs, please don’t. 😭 you’re one of the people whose long-form let’s plays I enjoy so much that I don’t wanna miss a second of the gameplay and commentary"
0,"I really like the idea of the long form videos if you decide to play/post map playthroughs again, especially if that reduces the effort required for editing and uploading. But if that requires more careful editing I wouldn’t want it to end up being just as laborious as breaking it up into multiple episodes and then deter you from posting at all. I personally wouldn’t mind a minimally cut long format video that maintains the narrative and cohesion that your old map series had. Also, I don’t know about logistics with collaborating with other minecrafters but some of my all time favourite videos of yours are when you played with friends. The appeal for me was really the fun you all had working through challenges but bantering and having fun while you were doing it. I also know that your videos where you played non-Minecraft games didn’t get as many views either but I really loved watching you play other games and seeing your different methods to approaching the various goals and challenges for non-Minecraft games. I still frequently watch Don’t’ Trace, Terraria, Cube World, Stardew Valley, etc. I’ve come to appreciate them more the longer I’ve been engaging with your work!"
0,"Speaking of more older Etho content, I remember really enjoying your playthroughs of some point and click adventure games on here. Crazy how the playthrough of Sam and Max is 11 years ago."
0,What about using a fence or a wall on the block under the slab instead of a slab? Would it make a difference?
0,"I wonder if the potions would fly more consistently if you used the same flowing water trick used in the separator but to prevent the final item from bobbing in the water. 
Might be easier said than done due to the slime block though."
0,"Have you tried the sequel to SOTS: The Pit? It doesn’t have the best reviews since they tried making it 3D, but I loved your original playthrough. I’d love to know if you still enjoy games like that."
0,nahh i was not expecting to lose etho to windows 11 today... Aware
0,Etho… in the picture of your awesome mic set up. I noticed to be what i assume to be coffee. That being said I think we all would like to know something. It’s something so important and the world does depend on it and for science. How do you take your coffee? I like it black or with some milk but that’s me would about you? Also awesome videos keep it up 🎉
1,"""We have a huge stack of Zombie Flesh to shoot through the Portal"" - Just things you can say in Minecraft"
0,Etho you should really consider a better mouse. The ergonomics and reduced strain of clicking in a game like Minecraft is huge
0,hello ethoslab i am a big fan
0,Oh God that comment about the original autobrewer being TEN years ago hit me in the gut lol
0,"I wonder if the pigmen jumping up when the pistons fire is causing the potion to occasionally hit one of them which would explain why the potion only sometimes hits all of them. Regardless, what an amazing design!"
0,YES TO GOOFY VIDEOS
0,"ive been doing the blanket thing for years, i highly recomend, and if its cold you can wrap a blanket around you and wear it like a poncho"
0,I wish i can show etho my game setup of laying down with the screen somewhat over me
0,"I can’t believe this series is still going, that’s really cool and reassuring. I first found your channel in summer 2013 which is when I got into Minecraft for the first time. And I’m still impressed with all the builds you made."
0,Ooh I see a little practice amp! Is that for guitar or something else? Do you manage to fit in much playing?
0,"I'd bet a playing a superhostile would go over pretty well as a live stream... ya know, just saying..."
0,"Hey Etho, if you hadn’t been making YouTube videos on it all these years, do you think you would still be playing Minecraft, or would you have moved on?"
0,Would you consider doing an elbow reveal? its like a joke reveal for content creators who dont actually want to reveal anything. i just think it would be really funny lol
0,5:55 I think I would have such a physical reaction to seeing etho irl. I got a wave of chills just seeing his desk xD
0,"Building on your idea of doing a fun video every now and again, would you ever upload you playing other games just for fun but make the video unlisted so it doesn’t tank your YT recommendations and w/e but you actually get to play and share more games you love with the community"
0,i love how u surprise us with uploads etho
0,Team Canada could return!
0,"New map play throughs would be amazing!
It'd be wonderful to see more."
0,"just to throw an idea out there since the world tour would be kinda somewhat soon, would love to see some guest appearances"
0,Dose etho play guitar or base?
0,"You are the only channel i watch regularly , I don't even play Minecraft"
0,I will always respect Vechs for introducing me to Etho!
0,You could speed up the potion reloading by breaking a chest above your head and remapping right-click to a keyboard input
0,Maybe upload the unedited version on another channel or something. Stuff like the long Decked out Supercuts are amazing to watch.
0,"Would this system also work for a Creeper farm, but using a Potion of Harming combined with the fall damage the Creeper takes?"""
0,We got a new Etho lore before GTA 6
0,"that chain potion contraption looks so compact, thats awesome"
0,"Everytime that potion hits the piglins I do a little bit of ""woo!"" :D
This was a fun project to watch."
0,"Hey Etho, I noticed you have a Peavey guitar amp! How long have you been playing? What kind of genres do you usually like to play?"
1,Much faster than the combrewter!
0,"Hi Etho! Regarding super hostile and attention span - I think most of your audience (including myself) have been following for many years and would actually absolutely enjoy long and less action videos. It’s probably true that most of the landscape online shifted to these high energy, frequent cuts kind of content. But I think your audience is different, at least speaking for myself.
Regardless of how you choose to do it, I would love to see it!"
0,i hope you can stream now Etho. i think it will be fun like you can build or grind material and we just hangout while listen to your story. i feel like your story or overall life experience is so nice and relaxing to hear.
0,With all these new decorative blocks and variations... Would you ever re-detail the Man Cave?
0,"I like the slow and longer content (though I don’t always have time for it). Everything else on YouTube now is so fast paced and it gets super overwhelming to the point where I don’t have the energy to watch most videos on YouTube sometimes, and just watch ASMR or something chill. Definitely feels like you loose some of that genuine-ness as well."
0,"Sorta about the comment, I think it would be fun if you did some separate content with hermits like mini series, maybe like a small modpack. I always wanted an etho & bdubs series!"
0,"Ah yes, the tissue box, my favorite reoccurring character, so glad its still around lol
Also, I did notice some bitrate issues at various points during this video
Also also, the one off videos were really fun, and maybe if you do go through with the 1-video-map idea a map type transition/recap would work? Like ""I was there, now I am here"""
0,"Etho! really neat gold farm design, i love redstoney episodes, thank you for allways delivering great content!"
0,Glad the tissue box survived
0,"Etho, are you really using a guitar amp as a subwoofer? Thats absolutely gnarly"
0,"Perhaps instead of a long series, you could upload a mammoth video along with an edited one. The edited one can appeal to those that want a short and sweet experience, the longer video will appeal to those of us who wants to experience every single second of the shenanigans."
0,"Been having a horrible week, seemed like everything was going wrong this morning, but that bad luck streak is over because Etho has uploaded!"
0,Maybe you could stream the superhostile maps?
0,"i honestly reckon majority of minecraft watchers are there for the creators! tbh anything you would put out, i would definitely watch in a flash! even if it is one timer games or even like the 3D among us you played with the hermits recently! 
thanks for doing this tho, it brings me so much joy everytime theres a new video! tysm!"
0,what about arrow with healing effect
1,New etho lore unlocked: he plays guitar
0,"I'm pretty sure last time you got a new computer, you went to this exact end farm. Are you taking them with you for bubble baths? Are we going to see another end farm computer update in another 15 episodes?"
0,<3
0,"Etho splashed out for an upgrade, I hope you upgraded your tissue box mic holder - 3 ply sounds good :)"
0,"Hey Etho, I feel like the bitrate of this video has been lower than usual for you. Is this a YouTube issue or are your settings in OBS (?) maybe different? Just a heads up!"
0,"I understand we need to keep the content tuned to keep the audience engaged - but I wonder if Etho ever considered a ""secondary channel"" for tutorials or other longer-format videos?"
0,Looking forward to watching vids in 220fps from now on!
0,"what IF......you use instead, Lingering Potion?!"
0,YAYAYAYAYYAAYAYAYY

0,Office chair blankets are finally getting the recognition they deserve
0,"Why do you buy an outdated budget pc? You have 2.6million subs lol
I watch you since over 10years treat yourself you deserve it."
0,"on super hostile, ive been watching other YouTubers play through old ctm maps and the like to honestly get away from the super fast paced content,, there's something so genuinely refreshing about super long form content, and its not like maps don't require some creativity o: in particular I've been watching a YouTuber named Neurotic Goose who just got done with a playthrough of an old Vechs map and his methods and problem solving skills set that playthrough apart from others,, I think map content from you would be fantastic honestly and how you would approach the map will make it super interesting o: you also were the one to get me into Minecraft maps, watching you play through Simulation Protocol all the way to Diversity 3 with team Canada, so I'm always up for that wave of nostalgia again!"
0,"I wouldn't have recommended the i7 14700K as their is a extremely high amount of cases where the 14700K causes a lot of crashes due to its high voltage burning itself apart, if you are going to keep that cpu, definitely under volting it otherwise in a year or 2 the CPU will be dead if not constant crashes on anything that requires a decent amount of CPU usage. I HIGHLY recommend changing the CPU to an AMD high end or at the very least go the Intel Ultra series CPU's.

Please please please change it etho!"
0,"Hey Etho! Long time viewer, i notice you have a small vintage peavey amp beside your desk. Do you play guitar? If so, could you tell us about your favourite music genre(s)?  Thank you for the hours and hours of inspiration and entertainment over the years =D"
1,"Hey etho,
I see you have a guitar amplifier. Do you play guitar?"
0,Love this episode
0,"Aha! A shorter episode, but well apreciated."
0,amazing video etho! the farm is seriously so cool
0,"I don't think you can actually move away and do stuff cause the mobs can only spawn so far away from you, and if you get out of the slabbed zone then they will spawn less and less in the designated zone and you would be wasting potions for nothing in return"
0,5:55 Etho. How did you get your two mice to move around your desk like that?
0,I miss team Canada videos
1,"idk if this makes sense to anyone else but the slower paced just walking around the base/world gives me vlog vibes and i think that’s why i’ve enjoyed any etho video so much, specifically the etho plays series. just calm relaxing chatting and sometimes shenanigans"
0,"I am sorry.. Happy you got a new computer and all, but is youtube not paying that much? The specs are pretty bad to be honest, I would expect that when it's a business expense and you do it for a living you would have gotten something better"
0,"#39 on trending for gaming on 5/22/25, 15 hours after upload"
12,"In general, your SHC films sound fantastic."
0,"Echoing what another commenter said, with the first trailer for Thaumcraft 7 dropping, I would LOOOOVE to see you do something with it when it comes out!

Long-time viewer, first time commenter - keep tinkering away in your blocky worlds :) Thanks for everything"
0,The mad bomber challenge was a great video
0,its wild to think ive been watching you for 10 or 11 years now
0,Basically SHC Movies from you sound really awesome.
0,All hail the costco tissue box!
0,"Loving the video Etho, that updated desk pic made me juuump! Honestly I know nothing about minecraft mechanics or redstone, but your content is so chill and fun that I would watch regardless of whether I understand it. So glad to see the tissue box remains 🔥🔥"
0,"Hey Etho, with the 1 episode per super hostile map video format would you consider linking a unlisted video of long format for those of us that would watch that?"
0,"14:25 iirc Methodzz and Glotz are the first time I ever saw entity seperation, but knowing the tech community it was about just not public domain"
0,This was pure Etho’s Lab at its finest!!
1,"Hey Etho! Please make sure to update your BIOS immediately! Intel 13 and 14th gen have long term issues that will slowly kill them, even at stock speeds and voltages, you'll noticed blue screens become more frequent. There's another update coming soon which you'll also want to make sure to install which *should* fully fix the issue for new CPUs, but once damage is done it cannot be fixed, it's permanent."
0,1:40 “I probably don’t have to worry about performance in Minecraft ever again”. 26:10 “That might be what’s causing the lag”
0,"Get a new desk, mount the monitors, reclining chair"
0,Over 10 years later and I still remembered my snacks
0,Did you build the pc yourself?
0,"did you see the outdoor boys retired, thoughts on him leaving due to the fame and attention on his family?"
0,The channel Neurotic Goose is running a Vechs map right now. His editing style seems to fit the faster pace of youtube without being distracting or confusing
0,Please do super hostile! Many of us still prefer the slower content. Doesn't need to be action packed in one episode from my perspective.
0,"The problem with doing the standalone video with a lot of editing is that it will take time and effort and it will substitute a video from your current series, which we currently don't have a good enough frequency on. I'd say for you to chill with the map, edit it to get it acceptable and release it as an extra. Bonus points if its multiplayer. When you finish the map/series of videos, release an edited version (that you can pay someone to do if you want, so the time impact will be even less). I watch edited versions of some series that you have made by fans and its awesome."
0,"Hey Mr. Etho, I'd like to know if you still play Hearthstone (or any other game) and if you would ever think about doing another video on it, I loved watching the Hearthstone videos you made a while back. Anyways, thank you for picking my comment, and thank you for bringing a smile on my face. :D"
0,Oh boy! I wonder if etho(ergo) will start a new project today!
0,Etho ive been wathcing u for 10 years ur the greatest
0,"We will always be there to watch whatever you put out, you have some of the most calming and wholesome and technical and inspiring Minecraft content out there.

Not sure you should replay Legendary though, getting back into whatever version of minecraft it was is gonna be a pain, and I'm not sure if Vechs ever ported the maps past the food and combat updates. And the next ones. And all those.

I'd love it if you played through Netherbound Caves though, I loved that map when I played it a few years back."
0,"A 14th gen intel chip? Well, expect to roll the odds on it starting to die from this moment on. Notoriously bad generation of CPUs, same with 13th gen."
0,Personally i think it would be great this format you talked about it
0,Super cool idea!
1,"Etho, I recently got my dad invested in Minecraft. He doesn't consume much out-of-game content (vids, wikis), because he loves to experiment, insisting I mustn't ""spoil"" how anything works. 
However, he gets stuck by redstone. He's frustrated that pistons get ""jammed"" in place randomly (quasi-connected without a block update). He doesn't get why hoppers stop working arbitrarily (they're locked, without visual cue). He can't figure out calibrated sculk sensors, or comparator strength. Do you think aspects of redstone that could be taught better, and how would you improve them?"
0,A new season of terraferma craft would be sweet
0,"Hi Etho, thanks for another great episode! You might have tested it before and I might have forgotten, but would it be worth smelting those golden swords?"
0,"if you do choose to do an edited down version of a superhostile map or such, please also upload a raw version unlisted, at the very least. I enjoy your vids"
0,"Amazing! New PC, New monitor, New etho pic and we kept the kleanex box! 

Etho I was wondering, in that picture I noticed the peavey amp in your desk. Do you play an instrument or is it for an audio setup? Im a music enjoyer myself so id love to know. Anyways thanks for the great videos!"
0,"I watched all the vids with you pause and beef on beefs channel.
Would definitely watch"
0,It would be awesome to bring race for the wool back!
0,"I honestly will watch hours of raw content, I don’t even need lots of talking!"
0,you should try to play adventure map Drehmal. I played a lot of adventure maps and Drehmal is really next level of quality and is simply amazing
2,15:40 Mumboing around??
0,"My brother and I grew up watching Etho, and we still sometimes text each other when you upload. You are a household name"
0,I also really missed the super hostile maps!ory of you figuring it out and conquering it was gold to me!
0,Jeez... Am I old? I remember last time you talked about your new computer... Which I suppose is your old one now....
0,"Man, I'd absolutely love it if you would pay a super hostile map again. But definitely in the slower playthrough format please!"
0,I go back and watch Canopy Carnage every couple years. I would love to see you replay it or similar again. Not sure I like the condensed into one or two episodes idea though.
0,"As far as CTM maps go, most of your viewers would prefer the long-form videos with minimal editing because of early 2010s nostalgia. The editing format in your Uncharted Territory videos should be the gold standard.

Some maps I recommend are Simulation Protocol III (1.12) and Ragecraft IV (1.20). These are both excellent maps that I thoroughly enjoyed playing through. Some older maps I also recommend are Titan's Revolt and Ragecraft III (both for 1.8.9)."
0,"Would love to see you play through an older super hostile map. I’ve played through a few of them recently with some friends, and they are an absolute blast."
0,"I would be absolutely ecstatic to see more super-hostiles, but I don't think I like the sound of too much cut content. I quite enjoy your videos, and in my opinion, the more to watch, the better. I went back and watched the entirety of the latest Decked Out season a few months ago, and enjoyed every bit.
As for what to play, I know that Vechs released a Super Hostile modpack for his later maps, and I remember you once mentioning that you had an itch for modded minecraft that needs to be scratched on occasion. Would any of those interest you? Do you have any particular opinion on the modpack in question?"
0,"Etho's brewer design explanation @ 29:10 in essence is parallel ""computing"" instead of serial ""computing""."
0,"You have a peavey amplifier.
Tell me you play an instrument!"
0,"been watching you for over 10 years and i will say i love any kind of video you make! i really enjoy your newer videos with a lot of progress and content in them, but there is something really special about slower videos where you get taken along for the ride. one off episodes would be really cool to see from you, especially ones where you revisit old maps or challenges. my favorite video of all time is your ""escape the nether with pause and beef"" video and it would be awesome to see challenge videos with team canada. keep up the great work etho!"
0,"Wow I just watched all the episodes that note his tissue box mic stand (like the weird playstyles Hermitcraft episode by Grian, an animatic of that by StudioLepta, Etho's perspective, and a reddit post + threads talking about Etho's setup shown from the image during the clip from his perspective), so to see an immediate update on the tissue box is pretty awesome"
0,"begging for long form content, i would watch a fully play through of those old maps omg"
0,New Etho lore. Peavey amp in the corner for playing guitar.
0,I feel like the dud potion shots might be hitting the pigmen when theyre jumping. Maybe try making the floor honey so they cant jump. Just a guess.
0,Etho plays guitar confirmed!
0,had a terrible today but its all fine now cuz etho uploaded :D
0,wow etho is doing redstone from a separate dimension thats amazing
1,hey Etho I've been watching for a really long time. i remember years ago you played a game that was turn based and you fought random creatures in a Sci-Fi space kind of setting. would you ever play that game again?
0,"Hey Etho, what do you use that peavy amplifier for?"
0,Blanket over the chair is very cabincore! :)
0,Yes! Please do more Minecraft maps- maybe 1 intersection an episode could be a good pace?? I personally would love to watch it in the slower paced old school format for the nostalgia- but i hear you
0,Personally i watch your content for the slower pace and dont mind the old school stule with less editing but i get that thats not ehat most peoppe want
0,I'd watch one off edited down map videos. Ambiguous Amphibian does that and I think they're pretty good. Honestly if it was 10 episodes long and we knew it was gonna be 10 episodes it might be more easy to watch. I've started watching more series than I've finished and i think the clarity of knowing when it ends makes it more watchable.
0,"As so many others said about themselves, I grew up alongside you and this Let's Play. It's strange to think about, but he may well be one of the most stable voices in many lives out there, Huh? Thank you ETHO."
0,"i love the idea of you doing the maps again, i think the ""highlights"" concept is good, but (and maybe this is just me being a superfan of all the series you've made playing maps solo and coop since like 2014) i always have loved the space between ""moments"" of moving around the map and stuff, they worked as build-up so the big moments hit even harder: a trap going off, a death, a great joke, a memorable interaction, etc. 

i feel like having the faster paced style would shrink that build-up, but i also think it depends on your particular editing hand, i really enjoyed all your decked out runs and i loved your editing style in them, not cutting out too much but leaving out some bits some people might've lost attention at.

whatever you decide i feel will be the right decision! (also definitely do the one-off videos again!, really important part of the Ergo Channel Experience ™)"
0,"Etho, could you have used lingering healing potions instead, or are they somewhat unfeasible to brew?"
0,Love your videos. Would love to see you do something like Skyfactory again. Thanks for everything you do!!
0,124 xp just casually
0,"I always love your vids and i never complained, but redstone on dirt... Love you Etho 😊"
0,YAYYYYYY
1,"Man, I started this series watching on a palm pilot in 1967 and here I am watching now. Etho didn’t even have a channel yet, I’d just sneak in and look over his shoulder. The internet wasn’t invented yet but just the two of us still had minecraft. I’m the equivalent of ‘first’ but with thinly veiled pretentiousness."
0,"Hey Etho, out of curiosity, what are some of your favorite other games? Also what are some of your favorite moments from those games? I know you tend to stick to minecraft for the channel, but you've played a few other things and have mentioned some other games, such as Terraria, Transformers: War for Cybertron, Pokemon/Pixelmon, and so on. I am just curious about what you enjoy, and things or moments that stuck out to you. Have a great day, and thanks for the video!

-Phoenixfury"
0,"Maps were fire, especially if u enjoy them."
4,"Sometimes I really feel like I need an Etho video. This was one of those days. the ""Hello Everybody this is Etho!"" never fails to cheer me up."
0,gotta remember Etho girls with watch anything you upload
198,"35:57 I loved the old superhostile / CTM videos. I really liked the raw, uncut long format of them, and kind of enjoyed when you’d be stuck at the same entrance to a room for the whole episode. The problem solving and shenanigans with Beef and Pause are something I miss in today’s YouTube meta. Maybe I’m just an old head, but I would love to see a revival of them, even if just on a second channel. 

I think you have a unique audience in the fact that many of your oldest fans are now grown up and don’t play the game anymore — we just still come back every episode for the nostalgia. You’re like a “comfort youtuber”. Someone I can trust to always put out enjoyable content. A fan base like that doesn’t care if everything is part of the new short attention span generation that needs constant action. We watch your videos for you. A 30 part series with hour long episodes sounds phenomenal. Great way to unwind after a day at work"
0,"Yes yes yes to bringing back super hostile & one-off videos! Revisiting Legendary and possibly playing a new map would be great. It would even be nice to see short series/one-offs of other games you're into at the moment, like back when you did Sword of the Stars & Hearthstone. It might be nice to be able to put out some lower-effort/less edited content to fill gaps between 'main' uploads!"
0,"love the idea of more one-off videos. ive been watching cscoop and friends play the old maps. and while we're a bunch of silly stoners, it's still very well edited and worth checking out for inspo!"
0,I would love to see spaz again just for a one-off episode like you used to in your LP's 😊
0,Whats the Peavey for? Etho a secret guitar player???
0,"That Peavey amplifier is amazing, with that desk and those speakers I'm almost transported back in time 😅"
0,You didn’t get an SSD??!?!?!
23,"It makes me really happy to see the 'Etho's lab' potion setup still working well a decade later. It doesn't seem to me that the redstone is that much different, just more compact with observer clocks and some added features. The 'auto-clicker' concept and execution was quite fun to experience as well!

Speaking of old concepts, back in the day you would often confess your love for sandstone. A lot of the older builds in your world are still full of sandstone, such as the original Tree Farm. Has that love faded throughout the years or does sandstone still hold a special place in your heart?"
0,"Makes me nervous when you are walking on orange glass on top of lava lake 😂

Why not also smelt the gold swords to gold nuggets 😊

I wonder if the ""complete the monument"" map is finally finished you played with Beef and Pause, it had nine wools ready at the time you played it."
0,"Etho when you bought your new computer, why did you pick the best specs from like five years ago? Not flaming I'm genuinely curious, I don't imagine you're strapped for cash?"
0,"Man remembering the super hostile maps was crazy! Thats how I ended up finding you back in the day etho. Do you remember the spawner ""eruption"" trap? What if you did a bit of a combined making a super hostile map/ playing through... though then maybe it will just be like another series that has yet to see its end..."
0,"Does off hand sword still do looting? That was an easy way to do it, if I remember correctly."
0,"Bring back team Canada for an adventure map, that’ll work to get those views 😎"
2,I would love another superhostile series. I genuinely think it could work specifically because it’s different from the high pace of everything on youtube these days.
0,"It would be awesome to watch you play a newer CTM map, with whatever editing style you prefer. Some of those maps are seriously impressive"
0,I would even just take raw footage of a super hostile map too. I used to love when you played with Beef and Pause on the super hostile maps.
0,It's crazy how an influencer from back in the beginning dark ages of Minecraft in YouTube itself is still flourishing in this crazy economy today that is the algorithm❤❤❤❤❤ love you Etho keep bringing it out man!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤😭
0,"Hey Etho, I used to absolutely love your ark series and pixelmon series, something about you learning and mastering the mechanics of a new game was always entertaining. Would you consider another short-ish survival game lets play. Maybe something like Satisfactory or The planet crafter, or maybe even the new Cobblemon mod."
1,i love how etho's reaction to doing something cool in the game is an evil laugh 12:28
0,"I wish java had trident killers, awesome solution you made Ergo."
0,would among us be considered one of those one off uploads? 😅
0,"So i understand the reason for throwing the splash potions, that way you also get the looting effect.

However couldn't you stand on a pressure plate to activate the dropper system before tossing them into a water stream and have them drop into the the first piston water column?

Also why did you not hook up a shaulker unloader for all of the potion ingredients including an auto crafter for the blaze rods to be distributed to all of the brewing stands for easy of refilling the chain brewing system."
0,"Hey Etho, I think that the healing potion may be hitting a zombie piglin that is falling down the chamber. This cause it to explode higher and one block back."
1,"Etho have you ever seen the game Noita, looks like terraria mix with programming wands... It also has a lot of secrets"
0,33:09 swords rendering timestamp
0,"I would definitely watch a playthrough of a CTM map. I think many Ethogirls like myself often go back to rewatch your past CTM maps (I think I rewatch Ruins of the Mindcrackers 5 times already).

A long video with timestamps would be a nice format, maybe in a non-spoiler form like ""Chapter 1: Introduction"" so anyone can jump in easily to the part they want."

0,"also, is that a blanket over your chair? i do that too, soooo cozy right? :P"
0,You've got to show everyone how amazing you've gotten at parkour somehow! I think most people are under the impression you still hate it lol
1,5:57 ETHO! is that a guitar amp in the bottom right? do you play guitar? i know it's not your style but you have to share sometime!
1,To improve your performance you should get some clientside mods. Either nvidium or a pack like simply optimized. They do nothing other than performance tweaks that really allow minecraft to use your gpu.
0,"now the setup has been upgraded, would you look into Buildstone upgrades? try animating the world~~"
1,Do you actually need lvl 2 healing potions if the pigmen are 1 hit?
0,Etho the wool carpets block the elytra noise from the sculk sensor
0,"If you are not sure about the performance of a game/map you can always stream it for a few hours, the slow content fit that better. I would definitely watch three hours and more happily<3"
0,"Project ozone 2 is maybe my second favorite series you've ever done. Also, we just got an air fryer. Highly recommend."
0,"I don’t know about other people here but I like the ctm (team Canada) and hostile map episodes. Although I understand the audience isn’t there for them. I would love to see some one-off eps. I also don’t think eps need to be 40min and have a massive build in each one, but I digress. Cheers ya’ll, have a good day!"
1,"I’m pretty sure, as long as pigmen are Agro when they die, they drop XP. So Minecart entity cramming is a great way to kill them. I’d have to test, but the potions might not need to be player thrown as long as you can keep agro on the pigmen (keep one in a cage with line of sight to you in the farm)"
0,blanket is too big. I used towel in my chair.
0,Thanks for the great video computer nerd.
4,"OOGE is how I got my wife to watch and play Minecraft. At the time, we just met and thought you and Bdubs were the best. She still watches to this day because of that series."
1,"Do you plan on playing terraria again? The “final” update for terraria is set to come out soon and I loved watching you play it in the past. Even if you played it alone I’d still get a ton of enjoyment out of it, but maybe you could do it with a hermit like iskall perhaps."
0,"35:00 
On the map stuff, I see what you were describing as a very successful format for a lot of twitch streamers, where they'll do one big edited hour-long mega compilation of all the streams they did playing a game. I see no reason why that format couldn't also work for a Minecraft map!
I think people do still enjoy some of that longer/slower content but they prefer it severed up all at once as something they can binge, as opposed to broken up into tons of tiny 20 minute vids. When it takes time for this slower stuff to come out people can loose engagement, but if it's something peeps can choose to sit down and take in all at once, they'll appreciate it more!"
0,One-off videos would be awesome!! Love the idea of doing a CTM map in the future too!
6,"My favourite series were always team canada slowly adventuring through maps/modpacks. I've forgotten how many times I've watched sky factory and captive minecraft. Not to mention ethos solo content too (ie project ozone 2). So I speak for myself when I say I love the slower pace videos, specially when you're enjoying yourself and not worrying about video timers and progress. But I also understand the need for growth in the youtube landscape comes at the super-action-packed-short-videos cost and, as always, I'll support you in whatever you decide. Much love Mr. Slab."
0,Are you going to pass on this world to your spouse?
0,"I watch your videos for YOU, Etho. Do what you find fun, whether that be long-form videos, series, or one-off videos -- I (and many others!) will be there."
0,"We have the same setup 😅, what did you do with the old one?"
0,"For the superhostile idea i think it would be a good idea to edit them down into one long video. I have been watching one youtuber do Rimworld runs (AdamVsEverything), which can take 20-40 hours, he takes the footage edits it down to a 2-5 hour video of the whole run. I find the format really nice"
0,"QOTD: As a self proclaimed coffee lover, what is your favorite coffee? Do you have a fancy espresso maker? Do you have a favorite brand of instant coffee or coffee beans?"
0,Double mice is crazy.
0,"Oh Etho, the Knicks just lost in game 1 to the pacers, it absolutely ruined my day. But here I am going to bed and you posted a new lets play, I’ve got to say that turned the day around a bit. My question for you is completely unrelated to Minecraft but do you have any sports teams that you follow at all? As a Canadian I would make a guess you might be a hockey fan but are you possibly a blue jays fan or a fan of any other professional sports? Just a thought. Thank you for the continuous effort myself and many others appreciate it more than you might ever know."
0,What we really need is team canada playing maps together again!
0,Seams like you'd be getting robbed a whole map in one episode. I could see a short series. Find a good balance type thing. We see you playing other games with people it would be nice to see your perspective.
0,prob still using the tissue box mic stand and 90 degree mouse with that new computer
0,I feel like etho is the kind of YouTuber that doesnt have to worry about the dreaded algorithm.
0,"I don't want fast, I want another expert skyblock series."
2,"Etho, we know YouTube's current encouragement is for faster content, but we also watch you to have that slower paced chill time, I think your audience will be fine with another superhostile series being how it was!"
0,An upload two weeks after the last? Am I dreaming?
0,Dare you to do the 404 challenge again!
0,"I absolutely have always LOVED any team canada ctm map adventures. I really enjoyed starblight deserts that you guys did recently. I haven't seen a solo run of a ctm from Etho yet, but I know I would love to see it."
0,"Hey Etho, with it on the horizon, do you have anything in mind for episode 600 of the let’s play series?"
0,Classic Ladders. Even his potions are going up and going down.
0,But did you replace the tissue box mic holder?
0,etho you could upload 3 hours uncut video of you just farming and I would watch it
0,episode name could be gold splash
1,"Etho, do you play guitar?"
0,Oh god wait till Etho hears about nice office chairs like Herman Miller or Steelcase Leap
0,"Hey Etho, 
i was eating a really good salad while watching this so i just auto piloted
Guess ill just have to watch the video all over again 
yay me"
0,Yes Etho! Do a map series! We would love it
0,Do you debloat windows before you set it up? If so what do you do?
0,"I am so surprised (and humbled) by your setup. considering the amount of time you spend on your computer (from what I know), you rock a basic wireless Logitech kb&m, itty bitty mouse pad, and 3 different monitors. Who knew that was the setup of the man who has the longest running Minecraft LP world/series"
0,what a god
0,"coincidentally I was just thinking about the days of OOGE the other day because another channel I watch is revisiting an old vechs map, and while you could be right that the majority of the minecraft audience might not be looking for that sort of thing, I know I definitely enjoy watching people going back and taking another look at that era of the game both for the nostalgia hit and to see how they tackle the challenges with the knowledge we've gained (or forgotten, in the case of changed mechanics) since then"
0,I don't know what is like it my absolute favorite memories of etho are crash landing and terrafermapunk plz more i enjoy your problem solving in systems you understand but haven't used and don't fully know after 10+ years. It's really something beautiful.
1,"I fondly remember my excitement every time a CTM or Project Ozone 2 episode came out. 

Beyond that, I've really enjoyed seeing Etho pop up in other people's streams, both for Minecraft and other games like REPO. The friendly, laid back nature and feeling that I'm playing the game along with everyone is something I feel modern youtube is severely lacking. If that's an algorithm thing, I understand. I just personally feel sad because it's like there's a content drought for the style and pacing I want. Luckily, the explosion of the ""forever world"" has seemed to bring a lot of small creators out of the woodwork who do play the way I enjoy watching. 

Anyway Etho, if you're in the comment section reading, thank you for being a consistent source of excitement and creativity. I always look forward to whatever you create since you break down mechanics and play games in such a cool way."
1,Hiking the Appalachian trail from Georgia to Maine and still gotta make time to watch!
0,"Hi Etho, very long time viewer. I first found your channel though your first blaze farm video.
I was wondering if you’ve ever considered going back to your roots and making a tutorial video on the basic redstone components you commonly use in your projects.
I’ve mostly played modded Minecraft, but I’m getting back into vanilla and finding some of the more complex redstone builds a bit challenging. For example, my item filters often break when too many items pass through them. I can’t figure out why.
I noticed that your item filters worked flawlessly on your gold farm. Even when overloaded, the filters didn’t break and the excess items made it to the end of the line.
I know you’ve showcased a lot of your redstone builds in your videos, but Minecraft has changed quite a bit since then. Also, to be honest, I didn’t really understand it at the time—I was a lot younger back then. Wilson anyone?
anyway was just hoping that you would think about it. keep up the great work. I always look forward to your vids."
0,"such a cool episode, keep it up etho <3"
0,28:40
0,"2 LP episodes, and a Hermitcraft episode in a month? Etho has been replaced by A.I."
0,Down for anything! One-off videos and condensed adventure play-throoz sound awesome!
0,Long videos with 100 days or a specific timeline to it do really well now so I think that'd work really well for one off videos c:
0,5:42 Etho's humor... peak
0,"I would love to see a you play a modern CTM map like Ragecraft 4. The map has alot of custom mechanics like custom enchants, secrets, bosses and puzzles. I played it with my friend a couple months ago and can certainly say it's my favorite map ever."

0,It's etho omg omg be cool argh it's etho
0,"it is just me or every time he open the book, on the lower right part there's a saving world automatically haha"
0,"Etho I'd love to see some of those videos ideas. Considering the editing cost of playing adventure maps, you might be able to get away with having a part 1 and a part 2, a CTM could be an intersection every episode.

That being said I'm not a YouTuber, so you probably are right about the single videos thing"
0,Anyone else decide to try draping a blanket over their computer chair? I think my life has changed forever. For the better.
0,"Canopy carnage is how I found the channel a long time ago, I would love to see another super hostile"

0,Please play superhostile
0,"Etho, have you thought about playing FTB again? Maybe a server with direwolf? I think you guys could do some cool stuff!"
0,"It wasn’t really a map, but I also really enjoyed your Crash Landing series a while back! Regarding super hostile maps, I think if you edited it similar to your long form Decked Out run, it could work"
0,"Hi, when might we see the game series come back? Thanks for the entertainment"
3,"Etho, would you consider playing some other games? Looking back at the terraria is EZ series, don’t starve together, and ark survival videos, as well as the terrafirmacraft series, I remember enjoying watching them after school from when I was a kid and even until I graduated. I’d eagerly grab a snack and would watch them with my younger brother. I’m glad the tissue box made it along for the ride aswell!

Also we love your long form content!! Last year watching your runs of decked out were awesome, and I’m sure you’d have a lot of traction if you chose to complete a playthrough of a map and post an extended version!"
0,Does new computer mean running up s2 of modded Minecraft again…😏?
1,It is so fun watching Etho get so happy over cool contraptions still! Been watching for over 10 years now and love seeing that joy still! Thanks for all the great videos 😁
5,I’d watch a 3 hour livestream replay of Etho. Who wouldn’t?!
1,"After 13 years of watching Etho, I noticed the Peavey amp interpreting he strums a guitar to some degree. Love building small pieces to the Etho lore."
1,"So glad you got yourself the new computer, you definitely deserve it. Gotta say that gold farm modification was super cool, just what I expect from Etho. I think that would be an interesting idea to put it in 1 video, but I do feel like it's a lot of work for just one video, but thats up to you. Keep up the great work!"
0,"would love to see a super hostile series, i would love to see it"
1,It literally blows my mind that i use the same keyboard as Etho. It just proves he has great taste. I have used this keyboard over a decade and I love it. Great feel and fuctionality.
0,"I personally would like it if you did a whole video series/playthrough of the map, like with OOGE or Team Canada. I don't mind the slower, longer form content because it means that the shenanigans last for longer. On a completely different note, I remember how much you enjoyed the Terrafirmacraft stuff and was wondering if you'd be willing to try Vintage Story. It has a similar, more realistic crafting system and a whole bunch of other neat things."
1,I agree with the one-off videos. I think everything being tied to a series leaves you with the burden and obligation of continuing that progression all the time.
1,"I love your videos etho. Thank you for doing what you do, I hope you still like making videos and playing, because I know I enjoy it so much. What’s your favorite episodes or projects you’ve done? I remember how much I enjoyed episode 404, but I also really like watching the nexus project too"
0,"Have you ever considered revisiting and/or spiffing up the _really_ old parts of your world that have been ignored? Like, I want to see something happen to the Nether village from ages ago, or the Emerald City, or that old overworld piglin farm, or the Project Pokemon stuff, or the cow fishing station thing, or the snowflake iron farm. Not to mention the huge projects which seem to have been ignored even at nearly complete stages, like the library or the oh so famous Nexxus. And of course the amplified area and the End portal base seem to have been totally forgotten. Even if some of these no longer work, serve their purpose, or otherwise make sense to use, some closure would be kinda nice."
1,"15:46 *in my best VintageBeef voice* :
Ayyyy! It’’s Ladders! He goes up, he goes down!"
0,I think a daylight sensor is shorter than a slab and may work instead
0,you should add dispensers and a switch to place the powdered snow to change the modes of the farm
0,Why did you pick windows 11 over what everyone else is suggesting to get (Linux).
0,"Hey, Etho, I'm curious, will you ever have another long-term gag or return character like General Spaz again? I also miss when you, Pause, and Beef used to do Adventure maps and Monument maps together."
0,Okay Etho I want your opinions on the Minecraft Movie
0,"35:53 honestly I hate that the norm is to fast cut everything. I miss videos where there was silence and you can really take in what is happening. I don't think there was more than a couple seconds in this episode where you weren't talking. Not saying I don't want you to talk, but the fact that silence pushes viewers away is just sad. I would love to see you struggle, watch you think and focus on something. I know I'm not the majority. Would you ever consider doing uncut (or less cut up) videos? Maybe on a second channel?"
0,Not putting redstone on stone slabs smh
55,Okay but can we talk about how Etho has _two identical mice_ and both coffee and water on his desk? Truly a man of chaos.
0,11:50 etho placing redstone directly on grass 🥀
0,I don’t recall the super hostile maps but I really enjoyed watching the CTM maps series’s and seeing in detail you going through them bit by bit and watching 10-15 episodes per series like that for a couple weeks
0,"Hi Etho. Been following you since 2010. You’re the reason I got into Minecraft in the first place. I also play just because I love the game and if I have friends to play with or not im still playing here and there. Honestly this game has been my greatest investment, buying it at 5$ over a decade ago. Just want to say im happy for you for treating yourself and getting a new computer cause I just did it myself a few months ago. Well deserved man and wish you the best. “From northern New York”. - basically Canada"
1,My favorite part of you playing the multiplayer super hostiles was that it was multiplayer. You had a lot of fun with the guys. That was the best part. The newer PVP series that you do and the multiplayer stuff in general is pretty enjoyable. It's an IRL sitcom.
0,"Could you add a system to dropper any gold that comes through the portal back through? It should come through the wrong direction, and then you should be able to put a dropper facing the same direction as the potions to put the gold back into the farm collection area."
0,"Im a fedex driver for coarsegold ca, there is a house i go to almost daily with a “ethosgirl” sticker on their car, did i miss a merch drop or are they just big fans like the rest of us?"
0,Yay tissue box mic is working ❤
0,Is anyone else surprised that Etho hasn't given Linux a try yet? It feels like a very Etho thing.
0,"Hey Etho! For the pigman farm, do you think it would be more efficient if you used lingering potions? Might be a useful application for them since I feel like they are often forgotten. Of course this would require a large supply of dragons breathe."
0,Post the among us footage! Unedited!
0,"no coaster under ur coffee,,"
0,Loving the background note blocks
0,Ergo I saw that Peavy in the corner of your office setup! Do you play guitar these days? I used to have a peavy like that when I started playing 15 years ago :)
0,Speaking of one offs I loved your point and click wacky computer game play throughs like Sam and Max hit the road.
1,Would you ever consider doing another series or playthrough of a game other than Minecraft?
0,"In terms of editing a superhostile video so people don't lose track, it might be worth looking at how Joe edits things like ravager rush! He's very good for setting up a map + focused layout that really enables understanding.

(also I will watch any etho video anytime you could put out a 2hr description of blocks you like and I would watch. Etho videos are comfy ^^)"
0,"Etho, if you want ideas on how to condense a video with an abundance of content, you could check out Minecraft hunger games / purge Youtubers. Sword4000 comes to mind but there are plenty. Minecraft hunger games is day long and purges take a few days worth of real time to play, but the videos get condensed into 1-3 hours. 

I think they basically cut all the grindy stuff. Notably, they introduce a new piece of action with a preface, then show the action, then have a conclusion to that scene before moving on. Sometimes they drop hints for future scenes, like saying, “this decision would come to benefit/hurt me very soon”. They also do part voiceover and part live.

I think their model might lend itself well to the idea you had with hostile maps content. They never seem like they jump around too much, but there’s enough cuts that it would still fit the mold of Minecraft videos for today’s viewership."
0,"I would love a film version of a play through with good editing! I'd certainly check in on the series version too, but YouTube films are defo the way to go"
0,"I'd be so happy to get a replay of some of the CTM maps!! I just finished a rewatch of a couple of those series a few months back. I'd much prefer longer form content over shorter form edited down into 1 video things. I saw someone mention a second channel — if it wouldn't work from an analytics perspective, maybe something like a second channel would be good for it?"
1,5:55 Thank goodness I was worried
0,The tissue box surviving is so funny.
2,24:20 can you put snow layers in the nether without them melting to get that perfect height between a trap door and a slab?
0,"Etho, is that tea in your mug (if so what kind?) or do you drink your coffee with THAT much milk?"
0,Have you ever considered a 2nd channel for longer form vids like Super Hostile?
1,"Etho, I think maybe some of the inconsistency with the potions has to do with the timing of the pistons on the trap. If you watch back, when the pistons push the pigmen into the center, a lot of them jump. I think perhaps the potion is being blocked by a pigman and unable to hit the center shaft, reducing its splash radius. Setting the pistons and potion on a slightly different timing may solve this!


In regards to the comment of the day, I would love to see the single video format! There's a creator I watch that has a similar editing style to what you're suggesting - The channel, Spoonkid2, edits down hours or days of playing Rust into a digestible length. Obviously the content is quite different, but it might still help! <3"
6,"I would love to see a return to LEGENDARY!  It would be really interesting to see how it holds up, it's been so long since it came out"
0,"you can add a counter in the overworld which counts to two, then send 1 item every 13-14 seconds, this keeps the chunk loaded all the time, but makes the mechanism trigger less frequently
you can also pipe excess rotten flesh to trigger it, so no fear of it ever running out of items"
1,I thought the removed getting looting from every player kill when holding a sword thing and changed it to only appky the looting if the sword is actually used for the kill.
0,If any potential sponsors are watching...Etho deserves a new desk.
0,"Man, it feels like yesterday that the episode 500 world tour came out. I’m glad the tissue box survived all this time!"
0,Hey Etho! Is making these goofing around episodes where you don't have a strict plan easier for you than more structured videos? I love all your content but I'm constantly thinking if there's any way for us to get you to release more videos and maybe there's something we would enjoy as much as your other stuff but is less work and stress for you to make :p
0,Did Etho just say a Nvidia 1460 hahaha
0,"I started watching your videos over 12 years ago now.
I've watched nearly every video you have released since. I would love to see more CTM/super hostile maps they were some of my favorite content.
maybe team up again with Zisteau haha"
0,"24:33 did you try snow layers? I wonder if that would be shorter than a slab, but still prevent the babies from going through"
3,I would LOVE to watch you play through legendary again. What a throwback that would be!
0,hi etho
0,"Hey Etho with the potion chain system, if the Zombie pigmen are 1hp is there a reason why the potions need to be Health 2 and not just regular ones?"
1,I would watch the hell out of Etho playing Blue Prince
1,"Hey Etho, I think it would  be cool to make a selective chaining autoobrewer, you determine which potion, the levels and modifiers, and how many you want and it spits them out at you or loads them into a chest/shulker. I think something like that could really revolutionize  the potion brewing system people have"
1,Use honey blocks to make sure the piglins to stay put
0,So glad about the tissue box mic stand!
0,"How long have you had that desk? It looks nice. I really like my L shape one. It has plenty of moving space underneath with is a much needed for me, But it has no drawers. Which I don't really need."
0,"It is a shame Adventure Maps almost went completely extinct in the Minecraft Cultural Zeitgeist, I loved them back in the day. I wonder if part of the decline was the adventure update making the game much easier and combat less punishing due to health regen. Would be interesting to see someone make one in a modern beta mod like Better than Adventure, motions sensors and spikes seem perfectly fit for a map like that."
0,"How about some A B testing?  Stream it using youtube live.  Upload a copy that's edited LONG, and then edit one edited as short as you are already thinking.  One with the most views after a month is the new format?
The nice thing about stand alone vids is they give new people a place to enter the channel.  Folks don't randomly click a big number in the middle."
0,"Hey Etho. What a lovely surprise to have another video. I am putting my SkizzleCraft Halloween roller-coaster on to a flat world. Unfortunately the Nether part I can’t join up however I am adding it to the Overworld. Going to have a link in my video so people can download it and ride it. I really want to see people ride it. I love seeing reactions from people. Which is partly why I watch you. Your reactions to builds, events and new Minecraft update are the best. Looking forward to your future goofy videos. Having creepers activating pressure plates connected to a slime launcher is so funny. You hear them sizzle a couple of times before they die. Was thinking I might make a farm using this idea. Wish me luck."
0,"The potion thrower in the overworld has one of the most random set up 😂😅 ""two sea pickles""
Nice episode Etho. 👏"
0,"Etho, if all of the pigmen are at half a heart, the splash potions didn't really need to be strenghtened to Healing II. Isn't it a waste of glowstone? It doesn't increase the area of the splash as far as I know."
0,"Why didn't you keep the timing of 18.5 seconds? if you stagger the potion to be more than 4 seconds after the item, would the potion not also reset the 15 second timer?"
0,"With your new PC have you considered going to modded again? I forget if you ever shared your reasoning for focusing on mostly vanilla and the existing series. and while you did address the ""goofy"" content and one-offs/short series for maps in this video's COTD, I don't remember when you last talked about modded and other content."
0,"Glad you got a new monitor, it was the biggest upgrade for me when i did mine. It is LITERALLY the thing you stare at, after all. When my buddies talk about PC upgrades I always recommend it"
0,"Would you ever consider building a Race For the Wool style game in the Hermitcraft gaming district? (Obviously in survival things would have to be different... but the core idea of parallel courses, interfering with the opposing lane, and having to return wool to the start would remain the same...)"
0,"Hey Etho, if you are setting up windows 11, I strongly recommend using Chris Titus utility. It's a script you run from windows power shell that lets you install stuff, customize and debloat windows 11 easily. You can google Chris Titus, he has a youtube channel as well."
0,"Hi Etho, have you considered starting another Terraria series at any point? The game has changed quite a bit since you and Zisteau last played in 1.3, and another pretty significant update is on the way (1.4.5). I'd love to see you two try to beat the getfixedboi seed on master mode though it is extremely tough. Great video as always :)"
0,7:20 etho almost falls into lava
0,"Regardging the Cotd and people not liking longer Minecraft content, that just isn't entirely true. I know of at least one Minecraft focused youtube who has recently put out a set of videos on a superhostile/vechs map, and I know others do similar for different Minecraft maps. and they maintain a good portion of their audience for those videos, because with established creators such as them and yourself, the audience comes for the creator and how they interact with the game, and don't necessarily care if its long or short content."
0,Add a little pit in front of the portal so any baby pigmen going through dont interfete with any redstone. Just some lava in front. Also removes items accidently sent through the wrong side.
0,"Well you know etho, streams are where you could play some of the slower stuff that wouldn’t perform well on YouTube and then later you could edit down the recording for a video"
1,couldn't you just fill the water in the overworld? like make a portal that gets empty bottles on one side and drops back filled water ones on the other... would have been cool to literally split the brewing to 2 parts instead of just doing it in the overworld
0,Legendary!!!
1,"Hey Etho, I have been seeing the same concept starting to be picked up by alot of different gaming creators here on youtube. I think doing supercuts is what it might be called? of recording x amount of content, then posting videos of it being condensed and showing more like a live interactive timelapse, or something around those lines. though I would agree, it could be tricky to do those with certain games or content etc. I agree it will be about finding the right balance for it to be successful. and I personally would love to see like possibly 12 hours of gameplay condensed down to like 3 or 4 super cuts of an hour's length video or could even cut them again into around 30 min episodes etc. Anyways, Thanks again for another wonderful upload of the LP. Keep Safe and wish you best luck."
0,A thought you could move the nether portal and send the potions through as items instead of entities so that way you could aim and not lose drops
0,I loved the series on legendary. I've gone back and rewatched it like 3 times at this point.
1,Seeing Etho play superhostile again would be amazing. I've been trying to get my old minecraft friends from school to revisit them with me. Maybe you could stream parts of it and cut it down into a couple of videos?
0,He said it!! He said it guys! _Legendary_
0,33:10 do this with other items please
0,"I've been subscribed for probably about 10 years or so now. When I first started watching I hadn't even started middle school, now I'm about to start Graduate school to get my master's degree

At this point I'm more here to watch _you,_ Etho, more than I am whatever game you're playing. Personally, I'd love to watch you play some old Super Hostile maps since they're super nostalgic for me, and I think doing them in one super long (2.5-3 hours maybe?) video would be awesome. Similarly, if you ever decided to play a different game all together (Terraria 1.whatever is EZ maybe? 🥺A girl can dream), I'd be more than happy to watch that too. But ultimately you do whatever works for you. Your videos have been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember, so whatever you need to do to keep them coming is perfectly fine by me"
1,The real spec we want to know about your setup is which brand of tissue box you are using now? Edit: I should have been patient
0,"Just the other day I was trying to work on something exactly like this stasis chamber that only dispensed one entity at a time. I'm lucky Etho just showed me how to do it XD.

Anyone know where the idea to line up pearls/potions with a sea pickle and weighted pressure plate originally came from? I googled for a while and couldn't find anything even though I knew I'd seen the concept before."
0,Finally haha
0,"Thank you Etho for the idea of using a tissue box on my microphone. It took a bit of adjusting to get it on my headset microphone, but since then it's done a great job stoping outside noises from getting picked up. Revolutionary!"
0,"Great video as always Etho! I was just wondering if upgrading the potions to Instant Health 2 is necessary?  The pigmen should be one hit from death anyways, no? You should be able to save a brewing step and glowstone dust by just using Instant Health 1."
0,I love when you guys do ctm maps
0,Double mice; now we're talking!
1,Perfect mix of redstone/action.  I could actually understand what your redstone was doing with the potion pusher.  Some things like the brewer go above my head at face value.  Thanks Etho
1,would the potions have to be healing II if all the piglins are at one half heart?  would healing I not suffice?
0,Engagement metric thingy
2,"As long as we’re talking about reminiscing, I would love to see some PVP content again. The videos we got back in the day came out of nowhere with very little context, and I always would’ve liked to see that aspect of Minecraft get a little more time in attention."
0,"Talking about your old content Etho and doing another challenge map. If you did play one to be edited into one vid, could you please upload the whole challenge for those who do enjoy the entire playthrough ( like me ) also would you bring in other creators like Beef and Pause or maybe B Dubs would be up for it."
538,"35:55  I personally still love the older slow paced style, and am sad that there are very few people that do it anymore."
0,Hope you upgraded to a high performance tissue box as well
0,Mannnn canopy carnage was a blast from the past 😆
0,"As per the comment of the day, I would LOVE to see another super hostile series, or really anything! Some of my favorite series you’ve done are the Super Hostiles, Sam and Max, and Don’t Starve - I really feel almost anything you do you will be enjoyable to watch ❤"
0,"I needed this video today, horrendous day at work but my lunch break was great thanks to you!"
0,"Etho, do you think you’ll ever start up another modded let’s play?"
0,"Etho please play some CTM Maps. I love your older ""easier"" content. OOGE is some of the best content I've ever seen. I disagree with you on people lose focus, I find its like breaking up streamed content into smaller chunks and I do think streamed content does well. Look at Decked Out 2, plenty of hermits streamed that and it did well. I understand why you don't want to stream but I don't think long format Minecraft videos are universally boring."
1,"Howdy Etho! Would you ever consider playing Ark again? I remember when you played and the great fun I had watching the episodes. Also, with the new PC, you could probably run Survival Ascended"
0,Only 8 more episodes to another world download 🎉
0,"Ooo, edited maps would make it waaay easier to watch. I used to be bad at sitting through them back in the day."
1,"I always rewatch the OOGE vids you have and still enjoy it very much, and would always think ""i wish he'd do a series like this again"" but one off vids sounds great too :D

I've heard you mention iframes again in skizz's stream today, and in one other stream then you mentioned fromsoft games... and that got my ears perk up lol have you played any fromsoft games? would love to see you play that! I played Sekiro and man was it hard my heart would be pounding when I defeat a boss ;--;"
0,I love this guy for years
0,I would love to see another Terraria let’s play but I get why he would want to do one cause of views.
0,"Since you have a new fancy PC, does that mean you will be uploading more often now??"
1,Does the new PC and monitor mean return of modded series? or was your computer not the problem when it came to that series?
0,"""Honestly windows 11 isn't too bad if you train it to be literally any other OS but windows 11""..."
0,More one offs
0,"I mean, i watched your deckput week videos so i am game for long stuff from you <3"
0,The super edited video would go hard
0,"Blanket on an office chair! One of the best things that I have ever done at home is put a blanket over it, makes it so much more comfortable!!!"
0,why is Etho's office So elegantly *brown* ? 😅
0,For ideas on how to make a single video out of a super hostile map take a look at someone like The Backlogs who does this for dark souls and other games. The videos end up being longer but are pretty enjoyable
0,"If you want to be really complicated you could do a witch and illager potion throwing mechanic. 

Edit: I didn't realize he needs to throw the potions to get experience"
0,Even the backup mouse is sideways smh
0,"Its always a treasure when Etho uploads. Absolutely love your vids. I think you might be the only minecraft youtuber I am still subscribed to. Been subscribed for years, and I have no intention of changing that. Love even just listening to your videos. Been rewatching project ozone and terrafirma punk recently. Hope to see another modpack someday!"
0,"If you do some maps it would be cool if you did a stream, or also offered a VOD version instead of just the cut version. I remember playing Canopy Carnage with my friends back in the day, I remember the actual map being so cool. You wouldn't even have to worry about being ""on"" all the time either, Decked Out, even while you were sick and not talking was always a blast to watch."
0,Need a new world download soon!!
1,"Hi Etho, I couldn't help but notice the Peavey guitar amplifier to the side of your setup. Are you practicing guitar while working in Minecraft?"
0,Office mouse without a mousepad certainly explains the geriatric movement
0,"Etho, consider starting a second channel! Stress free way to upload content other than main channel stuff, no viewer expectations at all!"
0,"When youre thinking about what to show or not it would be cool to see timelapses of your off camera building sometimes. 

I know people like smallish beans does that with some of his builds"
0,I would love to see a super hostile playthrough. It could also be nice as a novelty to see an old older version of Minecraft. I don't think you should trim too much of the fat though. It's fun for something like that to watch the process as well as the highlights.
0,Have you considered trying out Vintage Story?
0,are you gonna be able to go though an entire map in 1 or 2 days? superhistile maps are long even if ur going fast so this might be more work for one big video
0,you play guitar?!
0,"So etho has a guitar/bass amp at his desk, which is awesome"
0,"Hey Etho, I was just wondering if you’ve ever considered using lingering potions in some of your builds? I always thought they were a cool concept but it feels like I rarely see anyone use them? I was wondering if you had any ideas for using them in future builds?"
0,"Intel CPU and a 4060 in 2025? ☠️ 
Only 32gb ram and a single TB SSD as a content creator?

This is a certified UserBenchmark build 💀"
0,This was a pretty cool upgrade to his machine. I'd like to see more of the older machines which could benefit from modern automation get upgraded.
0,"Hey Etho, lately I've been seeing videos from your friends pop up where you're featured in the session, even if it isn't Minecraft related, and so my question is do you record those sessions in other games, and if so have you ever considered posting them anywhere?"
0,"Hi etho, when You got your new PC, did you consider installing Linux? I have found that In recent years the linux desktop is just as good if not better for gaming than windows with all the work that valve has put in to proton. I switched over to arch linux a few years ago now, and I have found it so nice to get away from all of the ad's in windows and the the mandatory updates and its nice having a computer that does exactly what I want it too and that I can customise however I like."
11,"6:10 Etho, I cannot emphasize this enough, but if you're spending every day sitting in a chair your _really_ should invest in a proper high end office chair with every possible adjustment. Trust me, your back will thank me in the future. If your chair isn't $500+ MSRP, then you're buying a cheap chair that either will not adjust enough to properly fit your body, or it's gonna fall apart after a couple years. If you are having to use a blanket on your chair in order to remain comfortable over a long period of time, then your chair isn't supporting your body properly, and on top of short term pain that can cause long term chronic back issues."
6,"Etho, regarding the comment of the day, I think a lot of viewers who watch your videos enjoy the long series like videos. Some of my favorite videos of yours are the team Canada series and I would love for them to return. I don’t think you should worry about viewership as most of the people that watch you are already used to those types of videos. I and I think many others would enjoy map/ctm style videos again just like you made them before."
2,"After watching the recent hermitcraft video, im curious to know your stance on tnt minecarts. obviously they are very strong for use cases like your timebombs, however, I feel they are far from practical to use in a more traditional mine. Are you happy with the state of them? or would you suggest any changes that would allow them to see more use in other contexts?"
1,I love the von sway of your gaming setup!
0,No way etho got a new computer before GTA 6
0,"Ah yes, the man whose blue jeans left a streak on the wall when he slipped doing a hand stand"
0,If you don't want the potion timing to be reliant on the chunk being loaded you could setup a designated chunk loader either lower or higher than the farm.
0,You should record long sessions and just cut it up to weekly hour long videos while you play. no editing really just raw footage with vintage etho. id love to watch you play super hostile style maps again.
0,You could also have the potions shot across through a nether portal in item form instead of entity form and then picked up by a hopper. This could allow you to shoot them out of a dispener directly at the zombie pigmen to allow more precise shots.
0,Nice! Etho episode! When is Primative Technology's upload?
0,"5:55 - Sir, a second desk photo has hit the channel."
0,"1:38 ""and basically what that means is I probably don't have to worry about performance in Minecraft anymore""

Famous last words..."
0,Wait wait wait lemme grab a snack
0,does having the sword in your off hand not provide the looting effect anymore? I remember you having the sword just in your offhand for the dog wither skeleton farm but
0,"Speaking of maps, Etho did you ever finish playing the Final Paradox map with team canada? I started playing that map after watching the first video of yall play it and it was incredible! It was the first CTM map I had played and I haven't been able to find a better one since. Would highly recommend finishing it even if its not for videos.  Love all you do."
0,"I would love to see more things from you, one of my favourite series was the original ARK play through with everyone. Of course YouTube isn't kind to playing things you're not known for. Would love to see a Highly edited series if that's what it takes, and then maybe uploading the raw footage on a second channel so the people who want the full series can still enjoy it"
0,Woa I JUST got my own new pc set up! What are the odds?
0,"I would LOVE a new Super Hostile series!!! OOGE and Team Canada map playthroughs were always the BEST! It's a shame Pause isn't around much anymore for more of that Team Canada goodness.

Map playthroughs are a thing of the past in terms of YouTube and I sorely miss it. Watching you play through some would be great!"
1,"I miss the old map videos. I understand how they didn't perform the best, but some of my favorite stuff from you was from maps like that."
0,"I was gonna ask about the tissue box mic stand, but I didnt expect getting an answer shortly XD"
0,You randomly speak to my soul brother lol I have the same office chair set up. Blankets ftw
2,"Hopping on aswell to say that Super Hostile would be so cool! I loved those series back in the day! 

If it happens and you decide to go for the one-video-contains-all format, I think it could be awesome as a long one, like several hours even. 
I’m sure it’d be an undertaking to edit, but speaking for myself, and probably quite a few others from what I’m reading here, a healthy chunk of people watch your videos because it’s you, man! 

The YouTube jungle is getting messier to navigate for sure, and who knows how well such a series would perform these days, but if you ever have the surplus of energy to give it a spin, it would be very fun to follow!

Thanks for all the videos throughout the years regardless. They have been much appreciated and have brought a lot of joy and comfort! 

All the best :)"
10,"When you moved the 400+ potions and some of them exploded, it's possible that there's a very specific height where the potions are just low enough and moving downward that when they get moved by the piston they hit the underside of the pickles.

Then again I have no idea and am just spouting random theories. I absolutely loved the video!"

0,"Take this with a grain of salt because im not fact checking myself on windows' memory management policies, but repeatedly loading/unloading the same chunk likely is not taxing your hard drive. Modern operating systems use a disk cache kept in memory, to lessen the load on the disk. Additionally, the memory page may not even be unloaded when the chunk is unloaded. And thats assuming that minecraft is actually calling for a writeback with every chunk load/unload, and that the JVM actually does it, instead of saving it to be serviced en masse every few seconds. Between minecraft, the JVM, and your OS i would be seriously shocked if loading and unloading a chunk repeatedly every few seconds actually did anything to your disk. Either way, it sounds like the 14 second interval works well regardless.

Also the one-offs of entire maps sound great!! Thanks as always"
0,"Etho, what other games do you play in your free time? Have you ever played Balatro? Love the videos, can’t believe how long I’ve been following the LP!"
1,"Etho I’ve been watching your videos for more years of my life than not now. I don’t make it on to YouTube as much as I used to but I also check if you’ve uploaded when I do. Your videos are hilarious and have a lot of attention to detail. There’s always a goal and an accomplishment, a central theme, a story, a plot. It’s not unseen, it’s very impressive and entertaining to watch! That being said, I don’t think any of us would mind looser or more casual videos! We would watch you clean up shulker boxes around your world for an hour if it meant an easier video put out for you! We love your thought process and passion for making quality stuff, the hermitcraft video where you walked us through how you make a video was awesome and insightful! 

Thank you Etho"
0,"Re: Comment of the day

While I would love to see you tackle another difficult map, your proposal for one long video doesn’t entice me. The joy of those series was the downtime/little moments. If you were to do something like that maybe doing it on stream would be best, with a VOD channel to back it up. I know that’s entirely outside your MO but I just don’t think the audience would be there for the one big vidoe"

0,"I dont think you have to worry too much about youtube metas too much. I feel like most of your audience is long time viewers. Maybe its just me because Im older but I see it as ""do I want to watch 2 reruns of seinfield or the new 45min long etho vid?""(I pick the etho vid btw). I dunno if my opinion matters a lot though because I watch a lot of ""longform"" youtube videos especially warhammer40k or elderscrolls related where each video can be several hours long and I just watch it like I would a movie."

158,As a long time viewer I will gladly watch absolutely anything Etho puts out. I've found myself watching clips of Hermit's streams with Etho in it. With that said I'm kinda glad Etho doesn't pump out content like most creators. The inconsistency allows me to actually sit down and appreciate it more. If I miss Etho I can gladly watch an old series and the videos still hold up.
1,uh oh Etho bought one of the melty CPUs
0,Does Etho still put up a world download anywhere?
0,The comment section under your videos always seems to be a positive and respectful place. Do you manually moderate the comments to remove ones that are rude or in bad taste?
1,"Yo Etho, do you need the instant health 2 if the pigmen are at 1hp? Could save yourself some glowstone?"
0,"If you calibrate a sculk sensor to a signal strength of 10, it can detect button presses wirelessly."
0,"You could also send the zombie piglin through the portal, collect them in the overworld for a while and then throw a potion after like a minute. Reducing the cost significantly."
0,"I'd like to submit an upvote for the adventure map series. Personally I would probably watch it reguardless of what format it comes in. Because you have the right kind of commentary for it.
But I must say I hate the format YouTube has become. I want the more immersive and slow series, but not many creators makes them.
I'm sure you have a lot more loyal viewers than the avrage YouTuber when it comes to these things.
Thinking of how your content used to be back when you gained the primary portion of your subs I would be surpriced if the majority prefers fast content."
0,Does the looting effect work if you hold the sword in your offhand? also i love your videos etho!
0,"RE the comment of the day, I'm a big fan of your videos and will watch pretty much whatever you post, but I do agree YouTube's current preferred form of content is very fast paced. I think there's a lot of people who would gladly watch a full unedited play-through of a map, but posting it on your main channel (where it would get fewer views than your average video) would probably hurt your standings with the algorithm. 

Would you ever consider a second channel to post content like that on, so it doesn't hurt your main channels success in the long run? I think you've discussed this before but I can't remember in which video. There's always the effort input/view ratio to consider with this type of content, where it's relatively easy to produce and you could still net a reasonable amount of views. You could spend an afternoon or so playing something silly, chop it into 3 parts and upload it straight onto the second channel.

I rarely comment on videos, but I just wanted to chime in (because I can't complain about more Etho). I'll use this chance to say thanks for all of the entertainment, keep doing you :^)"
0,22:45 Don't forget to add instructions for future Etho about how the system works.

0,I wonder what Etho is using that guitar amp for? Did he ever mention playing guitar? Ik he's into music but I didn't know if that was just a mc thing or if he plays an instrument
0,YouTube content rn is either fast paced or very long background enjoyment. Super Hostile could maybe take advantage of that
0,lol the cute little peavy amp on ur desk
1,"Make sure your motherboard has the most recent bios to avoid the 13th and 14th gen chip degradation. It would suck to get a nice new PC and the CPU dies because of the bug Intel had in those processors. And like you said, once you kinda customize Windows 11 it's not too bad, I'd just do what you can to avoid ending up on version 24H2. It causes a lot of issues for people, I know for me personally I was constantly crashing when using OBS when I got forced onto it. I had to do a fresh Windows 11 install back to version 23H2 to fix it up and then have forced my system to stay on that version as well."

12,"I'm honestly so glad that was a comment picked, I myself was wondering about that too recently. When I was younger me and my brother watched all of Legendary and SpellBound Caves and so on as the episodes came out, Canopy of Carnage was the only one we missed initally lol but went back for. I would love to watch a series with you and/or friends tackling maps like these again or even just a giant supercut. I'm the kind of person who will pull up a 10hr+ mega FNAF stream and even rewatch it on the regular lol. Even discarding length I juat love your personality and content so I'll definitely watch whatever you choose to put out!!!!!"
0,I wonder if the bouncing piglins cause the potions to miss more often. Might want to time the pistons to fire after the potion goes off instead of before.
1,"Hey Etho,
For those videos that don't do well enough to go on the channel but you would enjoy making (or videos you don't want to edit), consider making an alternative channel. Then just connect it to this channel as a community channel and those that want it should be able to watch without it affecting the primary channel."
0,Can't you just try doing the alignment thing when your shooting them so that their aligned?
0,For the Super Hostile idea: maybe play the maps you haven't played? Vechs has made quite a few since your series. Iceolation is an interesting one using a temperature mechanic. The latest ones use a modpack that adds magic to the game.
2,"With a new computer, are you thinking of starting a new modded playthrough? My suggesstion would be Hardrock Terrafirmacraft."
0,"I'd love to see some one off videos, that'd be fun. Maybe some unique challenges like you've come up with in the past. I always loved that kind of stuff. I'd follow along, or it would give me my own ideas related to the concepts. Always scratched that creative itch for me! Still love your series too of course. Thank you!"

1,I think you are right about the super hostile maps. however I think a group doing a one of race for the wool might hit the pocket that’s quick enough and easy to edit into one or two episodes.
1,"A blanket on the chair??
Scorpio: why didnt I think of that?!"
0,"21:21 You seem nowadays to be concerned about what needs to be shown and kept in terms of us seeing you build the things. I agree that showing the finished structure like that kind of makes me feel like I have missed a lot. But I think I remember in older videos that you simply added a 2 seconds transition containing like 3 jump cuts of you placing 3 arbitrary blocks of the build...And it makes all the difference in the world! It really shouldn't because we still missed 99% of the process, but then when you present the finished build it feels like I saw it being made! I might remember wrong though, if you try that and you see it does give that effect, don't worry about it.
35:17 About the super hostile series, I don't know about the other people, but the way I interacted with them definitely must have not helped your youtube algorithm. I always waited way after you post them for a moment when I could put the full playlist in the background while doing something else, and it would usually take me 5 episode to finally get the full picture and get invested. Now, I do not want you to hold back from experimenting with edits and ideas, but to me the absence of cuts (except really long backtracks) is what gives value to the moments that happen in these series. I wouldn't feel nearly as afraid for your life when you run out of your tunnel and dodge all the skeleton arrows to get to the other side if prior to that I had not dedicated these 5 seemingly boring minutes of you carefully digging that tunnel around the spawners. You could then think ""Well then, at least let me cut out the parts where no action is going on!"" (parts when you explore areas, gather resources etc), but what is interesting in these moments is not only your voiced reactions to what you see: I want to feel the atmosphere of that place. You are playing a game we can't really play (well unless we download it too), so these moments really do give that ""I was there"" feeling when its all over. To my eyes, the most recent example when you played something like super hostile is Decked out 2, and to me your editing of the first layers with almost no cuts, then the 5 layers with a lot of cuts was the perfect balance. If you can reproduce that it would be perfect for that kind of series. Ah and with OOGE and Team Canada hostile map episodes, all of you never making cuts allowed me to use the ""viewsync"" website to watch in sync all your perspectives, and that is such an augmented experience that I wouldn't mind if such collabs are made again in the future!
Ah and about keeping viewers attention... I think that the people you are talking about is the new wave of users that arrived to the platform when youtube grew to a lot of people in the past decade, and whom simply don't consume videos like the minority of us do. But you, do you feel like losing focus when watching other people's content? Does this actually apply to yourself? Anyway to me, I think you could never bore someone who is willing to give you their attention... but you can let them down."

I was watching those videos as they were coming out back in the day. One-off videos and map playthroughs OR minecraft 'challenges' can be an excellent avenue to getting new viewers. Things like skyblock, one block, speedrunning, getting the credits to roll with restrictions in place, etc. The most interesting part of a minecraft playthrough is normally the early game, getting geared up, getting things done for the first time in that world or series. Heck, bring a couple of the hermits along for a multiplayer and that would be sure to create some memorable moments. I know its a lot of effort, and video performance may be uncertain, but I do hope I see some content like that from Etho. Thanks"

Apropos considering whether a video is worth the effort or not. How much do you have to think of that these days? Would there be consequences of a not-so-well-performing video or is that something you could allow yourself to do or ""treat"" yourself with once in a while?

Yeah, the slime would be pushed through the water column, but that shouldn't matter as long as you delay the restocking circuit long enough.

Same goes to what you were saying at the end, I've been here for more than 10 years and I'm down if you wanna do different stuff, i remember you playing ark, don't starve, cubeworld, terraria, custom maps, etc etc. And they were really good times.

If your potions are landing inconsistently because they are bouncing in the water column, you should try copying the trick from the entity separator . It uses water flowing down from above to calm the entity bouncing. You could use scaffolding or lichen to contain the water flow and not stick to the slime block. I haven't done any testing but I think it should work."
1,"Hey, Etho! Every now and then there’s a new redstone component that’s a game changer, like the Target block or calibrated skulk sensor or the auto-crafter. How would you feel if a filtered hopper were added to the game? It would make storage so much easier but also take away some of the required ingenuity that makes redstone a special art."

0,Do you think the potions are hitting a falling pigmen randomly instead of the center column? If that's the issue maybe you could block the pigmen falling right before you shoot or something
0,Hey Etho! If you want to do some maps why don’t you start streaming again? It would be a great way for the superfans to have some more Etho in their life and for you to have a low-edited version of the games/maps that usually don’t perform as well. Have a great day and don’t forget your snacks!
1054,"Regarding the comment of the day, I think I speak for a lot of your viewers when I say that we do enjoy the longer form, somewhat slower content. The YouTube and entertainment meta has shifted over the years but I for one would absolutely enjoy a full unedited playthrough of a map and I see that same sentiment from a lot of comments. Of course, an edited down version would also be very enjoyable. Any Etho content is good Etho content :)"

1,"*Sigh* ""We'd love to do X, and some of you say you'd love to watch it, but YouTube analytics say it wouldn't get views and that's what really matters, so no."" I've been hearing this a lot lately, from many different creators, and it's so sad. Maybe we need a second Etho channel for uploading unedited content without caring about the views, so it doesn't mess up the main channel's algorithm or take too long to make?"
15,"The comment at the end sounds like perfect livestream content. Those who want the edited down version can watch on youtube and those who want to watch the whole thing can view the VOD. Also, I agree that we need more one off style videos... variety is the spice of life! On a separate note, I think this is the first comment Ive written on one of your videos and Ive been watching from near the start (LP ep 79 I think). From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for all the countless hours of entertainment and joy that you have brought to all of us!"

The last year or so, I have started to be kind of put off by the tempo and the amazingness of many YouTube videos and gotten quite inhibited. I only recently started to enjoy my hobby again. And it was because I started to look at your old videos again with the slow, relaxing tempo. And I thank you for that!"

5,"Would love to see a modern legendary replay, or a return of those old one-off speed challenges you did for a little while - maybe even the exact same speed challenges, done on current version. It'd even be really cool to see a bunch of the hermits get together to do something like Smallant's lockout bingo, which is very similar to the speed challenges but a bunch of them all on a bingo board vs another team."
0,Etho I know it’s expensive and I definitely cried when I bought it but buying myself the herman miller embody chair is probably the best thing I ever did for my body. I can honestly play all day (12+ hours some days) and not have ANY pain at all. It made me go broke but if you can afford it then it’s a wonderful investment imo. Your back is very important and you only get one lol. Also they have a 12 year warranty which is awesome

2,That it has been over 10 years since the auto-brewing and lab build really hurt my brain. I mean yeah it feels like its been some year's but over 40% of my lifetime is crazy
0,"Etho if you play a super hostile, I will personally watch it on all my devices thousands of times. I mean it!"
1,"Congrats on the new PC, Etho! Though, hearing you say Intel 14,700 does have me concerned, of which I can explain why after my following redstone suggestion/rant (b/c I want the first part of this to actually be about Minecraft and this video's content and NOT about the Intel controversy).

So, idk if you're still getting gold drops coming through the portal, but if you are one possible idea could be to have another line of hoppers on the other side of the Overworld portal to catch anything that spills out into the Overworld, if you have the space in-between the portal and the potion launcher & I remember correctly that hoppers don't/can't suck up throwable projectiles like thrown potions or ender-pearls. You could then either drop/dispense those items back through the portal on the same side for it to be picked up by the regular collection system OR have them snake around to be put through the other side of the portal outside of the killing & collection chamber and use them as ""fuel"" for the items that you send through from the Nether to signal the potion launcher to fire. Though honestly by that point, you could probably just not bother with all of the snaking around as much and just feed the dropped rotten flesh as the ""signaling"" items, though AGAIN *that* might not be worth it b/c with all of the snaking of items around & through the portal it should be possible to recycle the items within a closed loop so you won't have to refill it ever meaning there wouldn't be much point in trying to feeding some of the drops off into that subsystem.

...
Regardless, as for why I'm concerned for Etho & his PC, this is just a paraphrasing of how I remember this narrative being told to me, but the core controversy surrounding Intel and their CPUs is true. 
For those unaware, in either the 13th or 14th generation of Intel CPUs there was a discovered issue in which basically these CPUs would overheat themselves to the point of self-damaging themselves, as in literally melting themselves alive essentially, eventually destroying themselves until they were inoperable anymore and possibly even wrecking the CPU slot on the motherboard as well! However, after people tried to tell Intel this AND they eventually investigated their own parts to find the same results, Intel still ignored the problem, even stating at the time that there was NO heating issue (as a lie), and then release their next generation of CPUs, either the 14th or 15th gen, which *still had the same overheating problem* as their predecessors. 

It was only after this 2nd generation in a row of failures occurring is when Intel finally did anything about it and eventually released a software patch for these CPUs. I believe this patch did fix the issue, but again it was only AFTER people's machines were ruined by this mistake, which in of itself is fine, but it is the fact that they tried to cover it up and even still release their next line of products with the EXACT SAME FLAW still present in the design. 

At this point for you though Etho, it is a bit too late w/ you having already bought the computer, but I'd suggest at the very least investigating this story for yourself and verifying if you/your PC might be at risk. For me personally, I am boycotting Intel products until they can win back me and my fellow colleges' trust again, and I advocate for others to do the same if you care enough about your PC not being melted alive by willful ""mal-practice"" (as the only word currently coming to my mind to describe their actions), even if you're not buying the part directly from Intel and it is part of a pre-build like I believe Etho's was, and I'm going to be sticking with AMD processors from now on."
0,"Regarding the one episode map video idea in the end - apparently really long videos tend to perform quite well on youtube nowadays, because people tend to watch them in chunks and so it really counts as multiple views. AdamVsEverything's edited Rimworld runs are of this form. Of course, this is a lot of editing, I don't know how feasible it is when you're doing it yourself rather than having someone edit it for you."
0,"Etho thanks for these years of entertainment. It's such a fantastic thing knowing that you are still making videos and keeping this original world alive.
  I admit I'm not a constant viewer but coming back and seeing you are still actively posting is litterally keeping a piece of my childhood alive.
  Genuinely thanks!"

0,I notice Etho no longer calls it the goon farm...
0,"For what it's worth, I mostly watch your videos for comfort rather than ideas (I don't play much anymore): you have a style of videomaking that's a really nice mix of entertaining and relaxing (and I'm sure nostalgia is also a factor :^) ). I've recently been rewatching your Uncharted Territory II series and enjoyed it, and though I'm still enjoying it in 2025 I do see what you mean about pacing. So I would certainly be really interested to see what you'd do with a CTM map in a more modern format. But I appreciate this is only one voice among many. Anyway, very much love your videos!"
0,Hey Etho! Any plans on visiting modded minecraft again?
295,"Speaking of old Etho content that holds a special place in people’s hearts - I consider Skyfactory 2.5 with Team Canada and Project Ozone 2 to be 2 of my favorites series on YouTube. I watch both at least once every 1 or 2 years. I know modded series have their challenges, but I would be over joyed to see some modded Etho content.

Speaking of which, Thaumcraft just released a trailer for their new edition and I know that you have a lot of history with that mod. Could be a fun mini-series or potentially a one-off for fun."

I would love to see that, a channel where you can be a bit more experimental and free. 
Not complaining though, I'm very happy with the videos on this channel, don't get me wrong :D 
I'm just missing a bit the variety from back in the days, and playing some co-op games together with friends. 
It was always a nice surprise to see a new game. 
I'm really fascinated with how different people play games, and you always had interesting approaches of playing them.

Anyways, I'm thankful for any video you upload. 
Keep it up, and have a nice day."
1,"35:25
Etho, you could always stream the superhostile map and THEN edit it into one episode for YouTube. I know you have talked about your concerns with streaming, such as the need to keep the steam interesting. However, I still think people would watch and nonetheless be used as an incentive to play the longer formatted games you'd like to play. I have seen you experiment with games like hearthstone, but I would think this is a bit different since there is an 'end goal' to a superhostile map; hence, an end goal to the steam."
0,"Etho! Almost the big 600! What do you think is the best episode you've ever done? And, just for the comedy, what's the worst? (Of course, there's no such thing as a bad episode of Etho Plays Minecraft, just having fun!)"
0,They are landing on the pistons while they’re falling
1,"No matter what happens I’ll always want more Etho content but I can’t tell you how exciting it would be to have one off videos again.

0,"Thank you for the content!!!!! regarding the off-camera work and also the ""time-jumps"" you said in the end about the maps, you could intoduce them in the form of timelapse!!.

0,"Hey Etho, you know how the Minecraft title on the start screen can read Minceraft, you should title one of your episodes that and see if people notice 👀"
11,"I miss Vinyl Fantasy and when Etho breached. I'd watch an entire series or a single video. I honestly don't play Minecraft anymore so I don't do it for the creative ideas. Haha. I just like watching Etho being Etho. My child has started watching Etho as we deemed his Let's Plays to be mostly G rated and the longer video format feels a lot better than the shorts format. Depending on the day, he can play Minecraft on the Switch. He showed me a XP farm he cobbled together by himself and I can only assume some technical knowledge is coming from here. Kinda mind blowing to think about it time wise, but I am happy its helping to teach him to think mechanically."

0,Etho! I noticed the little Peavey amp in the corner of your desk set up. Do you play an instrument?
0,"Just on some rough stats about a super hostile playthrough; 
A channel I watch is currently going through an old Vechs map. 
The second episode has roughly 75% of the views of the flagship series, and over twice as many views as the oxygen not include series. I’ll have to see how the stats for episode 3 pan out. 
Granted it is a solo playthrough so he does skip a LOT of downtime, I think it stands that a super hostile might not be as much of a view tank as it once was."
0,Did I see a guitar amp beneath your new computer tower? Do you play the electric guitar Etho?
0,"Third and final comment(lol apologies), this however in regard to the comment of the day - that format is almost perfect to play how the hermits and martin n jimmy do the guess that build and hide n seek. Etho adding that game to the rotation would be sooo awesome. Well, whatever+Etho=Awesome regardless so i mean, no real big surprise there I suppose."

First of all, it'd be a lot of editing work for you. Secondly, it'd be a loooooooooong video. And lastly, it still wouldn't be a great viewing experience.

Thank you for another video ❤ I haven't played Minecraft in years, but it's always a pleasure to watch your videos while having a snack after a long day at work.

Looking forward to the new look of those valuable areas in the Nether! The slime launcher is a great set up, even though I have used these launchers before, I have never considered using it to send healing potions through a portal."

1,"Highly recommend a program called StartAllBack, it makes windows 11 look and feel like Windows 7 without compromising anything, its pretty fantastic."
0,Watching you build the stasis chamber i jusr cant help but think.... wouldnt a dispenser do the trick? You only have to cover like 3 blocks of distence if you place the portal well.
1,:o is that a peavey rage!? That amp is awesome. You're so cool Etho keep being u
0,Etho please say that this means we can have another heartstone video plzpzlpzlz
0,Will happily sit through 2 unskippabke adds so tho gets the monitised money (not even being sarcastic)
0,"Regarding the superhostile question at the end. Personally I would absolutely watch it, devour it even. But that's not how youtube works anymore, sadly. So maybe you could do it like various other creators. Doing a livestream und uploading it (unedited) to a second channel. Or create yourself a patreon and upload the videos there. I would glady give you a few bucks, any maybe you changed your way of thinking about how you want to get paid and accept donations now? :D"
0,Geeks out there are SO going to try figure out your height from your desk pics.
0,etho! you have to get an xxl mousepad/deskmat it will change your life!
1,"Please do more goofy, silly, one-off videos!! It's nice to break up the usual routine every so often :D"
0,"It wouldn't work for this application, but for other potion related projects you should check out 2no2name's videos on controlling witches with vindicator raid captains!"
0,Once i finally get a pc hoping to get one by next year im not sure if is a good i dear to timelapse a build and explain it or cut out the timelapse but explain why is there
1,"if we get the heavily edited version - can we also get the full (doesn't even have to have commentary?) version of the map? my favorite part of the map was just watching you play through it and beat the challenges and figure things out and explore and yada yada etc. But hey, do whatever you gotta do! More fun videos are welcome!"
0,"everyones talking about the blanket, but no ones mentioned the fact that he has 2 mouses. 2 mice? either one, he has 2 of them. Whats up with that?"
0,"Hey Etho! Now that you have a new setup, do you plan on making 2K or 4K videos?"
0,etho
7,"Do I know anything about redstone? Probably the most basic stuff. Do I still try to understand whenever you show the guts to any build you create? 100%. I love that even though half the time I have no idea what I'm looking at, you still manage to make everything entertaning and digestible enough to follow along.

Which leads me perfectly into my next point - whatever content you make, I, and I'm sure many others, would always happily follow along. Thank you for being you, Etho! Congrats on the new setup, thank you for saving the tissue box haha, and I'm excited for what's to come! 💕"
0,"does anyone knows if the looting trick still works? i remember hearing it got removed awhile ago, 1.16 maybe"
0,"love knowing your new computer is working for you!! I also have a blanket on my chair, folded up twice as a cushion haha! excited to see the nether changes too, it seems like a good project to sink your teeth into

and yes please for the one-off vids !! sometimes it's nice to kick back and watch a continuing world, but other times, I wouldn't mind seeing a little one or two vid long bite into something new! It's kinda like the life series, yknow? a short thing to come back to like a movie"
0,Why not use just a pressure plate to turn off the enderboys ? Just seems way simpler and much more reliable.
37,"36:02 I’d prefer having that as a longer format. I know what you say with the quick paced, action packed YouTube, but I really love the longer format stuff. I do not have much time, and I want to spend it on things that I like, and lately that has mostly been long format repo streams of you hermits. So I don’t know but I think there is quite some of us that would also enjoy a more long format-y Minecraft map playthrough, maybe a 1h episode or something of that magnitude? You usually hit a very sweet spot with the not to much action but not too boring editing, so you definitely could pull that off. For a map I think it’s better to error on the little bit too little action rather than, too fast paced and losing the connection. 

Loving your content pretty much since the lamas started moving around sandy city, and am happy to hear you like your new setup! Have a nice day etho!"
0,"By default I include shut-offs in everything. Especially anything that operates passively.  Also, I know it is less convenient, but wouldn't splash potions be more effective? At least clearing the room. Right? I mean, those that survive, if any, will just walk into it(probably)."
0,"Wake up from migraine an hour before I have to go to work, and see an etho video!?!? And it’s only been what maybe 2 weeks since the last one. Heck yeah imma be in a good mood at work now 😂"
0,"Hey Etho with the new PC are we getting 4k content? 👀
Love your videos <3"
0,"6:08 mentioning this made me do it as well and it is very comfortable, thanks!
Getting office tech tips from a minecraft youtuber was not on my bingo list for this year lol"
0,"Two sea pickles on a wall? I’m unsure how they came up with that, but still super cool functionality.

 I would definitely appreciate some more one-off videos in the future! Been watching some old Zisteau videos and had the same craving for some nostalgic super hostile content. Too bad that’s not what viewers are looking for nowadays. Your speed challenges were super entertaining, so I’m sure people would love to see more content like that. Anyways, keep up the great work!"
0,If you do make a super hostile style video it would be great if you could get Zisteau to do it multiplayer
0,"Hey Etho, I was wondering if you would ever consider animating some of your world with buildstone? It seems to be pretty popular right now and I just love the energy it brings into builds and I think it would look awesome in your world! I think it would also be the perfect time to start since you wouldn't have to worry about lag with your new computer. I'd love to see what clever ideas you come up with to animate things!"
0,For the portal and dispenser maybe u could raise the water column in the overworld up by one block or lower the portal by one block so it pushes it through higher up in the portal?
0,Would items get stuck if you replacing one glass block in the middle with an end rod? Or would the potion completely miss it?
0,The Tissue Box™ Stands!
0,"Hey Etho! You wanting to try maps again but wanting to edit it differently is a great idea. I would definitely watch. If you are looking for some ideas of how to edit, check out some of the popular battle royal game channels. There are several that really tightly edit server wipes into nice 1-3 episode stories. My top choice is Willjum who plays solo Rust for editing inspiration."
0,"Congrats on the new PC, that's always fun!!"
0,"Idk if you've answered this before, but in the updated setup picture, it seems like you had an AMP or something below your new pc.

Do you play any electric instruments?"
0,"i love the super hostile / map series idea. i just fear itll be a hella of a lot of editing . but if its something you do only once and a while and you really enjoy it, i think that could work!"
0,"hey etho,
bouncing off this eps comment of the day, ive been rewatching project ozone 2 and love the automaton / factory elements. any new modded stuff coming soon? especially with Thaumcraft 7 being teased recently, modded season three question mark?"
0,"Hi Etho, maybe you can prevent the pigs from jumping by letting them stand on honey blocks. Alternatively, you could do the triggering of the pistons after they die instead of before, as that's what seems to cause them to jump. Think the potions might be hitting jumping pigs instead of the middle column, causing them to miss a few on the player side of the kill chamber.

Always a delight to watch your let's play episodes (or any of your vids for that matter). Have a good one!"
1,"Hi Etho, another comment said that most of us just love to watch you and I hope you know that's true. I just went back and saw your playthrough of Terraria with Zisteau and was wondering if you have any plans for another terraria playthrough with the new 1.4.5 update about to come out? Thanks for the videos <3"
0,ETHOI!!!!
0,Not too long ago I watched your one off hearthstone videoes 😂
0,Etho! Saw your Peavy amp! What's your rig?
1,im so happy rn i literally just woke up and theres a new etho video
0,To make the launcher consistent and stop the bobbing couldnt you do the water going downwards trick like you did holding the potions the step before?
0,"Etho I remember you doing Cube World. I was so sad when that game stopped developing. Would you ever look into playing new games like that? Also, when you play repo would you ever consider posting that on your chanel?"
1,Hey Etho. I see a peavy amp in your desk picture. Do you play guitar?
0,Would love to see the whole map in one big video idea in the future!
1,"Hey Etho, I saw you have a guitar amplifier next to your desk. I wonder if you play the guitar? And if so, what kind of music do you like to play?"
0,Peak setup
0,I miss pixel piracy and starbound! I also wish you’d show us your factorial save and do some faster than light runs! I don’t care as long as it’s EthosLab!
0,"Hmm. what a fascinating new desk picture! We can see... far less than in the original desk picture, BUT,  in this one there is a cool amplifier visible in the bottom right. Cool."
1,I have that same Peavy amp.  I think.
1,"Hey etho, with all the upgrades you’re making, have you considered getting a mic stand :p"
0,No mouse pad is diabolical
0,"The sound seems good to me.

Shame you can't totally kill the horizontal velocity of the potion, then you could drop it straight on the zombie pigmen.

The idea of you making the nether more presentable is good. Flying to get up there can be made fancy too with nice tunnels and an easy way to get off at each ""floor"". As much as I like elevators."
0,"Etho hasn't changed a bit. All of his videos get over 400k on average, but buys himself a I-7 and a 4060."
0,I was thinking about having the potion fall from above the pigmen spawn but would probably hit them on the way down if it isn't timed with mob cap. Yours was really cool to see!
0,Didn't they remove the looting effect while holding a sword thing some patches back?
0,Super hostile and one off videos sound fun! Sounds like a lot of work to edit all of a super hostile into one video. Would you consider getting an editor? I'm sure there's plenty of more people willing to be a channel member if ads cant pay for that alone
0,5:55 Is that an amp? Do you play guitar etho? :D
0,"Does changing the type of block in the central pillar help the potion more consistently get all the pigmen? A wall block could allow the potion to break more centrally to the chamber. Additionally, if you delay the item pusher timing to be right before the potion breaks, the mobs seem to get pushed closer to the center and might be splashed more consistently. I wonder if there is a way to use the downwards flowing water meets upwards bubble column trick shown in the entity separator to reduce the bobbing of the potion in the slime launcher chamber. 

Also a new happy ghast elevator up to the iron farm? -Cheers!"
0,"Love the video Etho, I've been playing minecraft for quite a long time and always enjoyed your videos, but ive been mostly playing 1.8.9 pvp. I was wondering if you had any tips for getting more into redstone. I've always enjoyed watching your redstone projects but I just struggle when I try to figure stuff out in my own singleplayer worlds."
1,I think Vechs is still making maps!! You should have a look & see.
0,"I'd definitely watch you play through Superhostile maps, even unedited lol! Regardless of what you decide, I'll definitely be there :D"
0,How annoying to have an etho video interrupt me watching etho videos.
0,I think this first time In along time I have watched your videos. Love happiness and peace thank you for all you do
0,"Hi Etho,

would you consider playing other games beside Minecraft? I mean games you never played on your channel.

I really love all the other games - Terraria with Zisteau, Ark, Dont Starve and Pixelmon...  Pixelmon is not technically other game.

I know you mentioned that other games didn't get enough views. But some of them did. And it's about balance.

I love your videos. Thank you."
0,Holy crap he finally got a good enough camera face reveal?😂😂😂
0,same keyborad?
0,YEAHHHHH TISSUE BOXXXXXX
0,"I would love more random content! I worry that one video per map would be a bit too hectic, i quite like seeing the time put into it - you probably don't need literally every moment, but if it gets reduced to a highlight reel I don't think I'd enjoy it as much. maybe 2 or 3 episodes instead? 
I would also love to see some of the 3D among us if you were recording for it! I realise its not exactly your normal content but i really enjoy watching you play :)"
0,Etho what do you do to get such large quantities of sand for glass/tnt/etc? It seems like the most difficult to mass gather resource
1,A good time to be alive
1,"Intel 14700 had some corrosion issue and had to be fixed by updating the motherboard bios, please check your bios version"
1,I would love to build you a new desk… next improvement.
0,"Speaking of longer form videos, if you're ever in MCC again would you consider uploading your whole POV? I always try to catch them live, but I have definitely gone back and watched entire VODs from others"
40,"Plus one for super hostile! I just started re-watching the old OOGE videos. 

But honestly I would be in to watch you play any game! Thanks for the awesome content Etho!"
0,Its really cool to see you revisiting the idea from that enderman farm bc i thought the potion setup for looting was really cool
1,Its nice to see an Etho upload after a long day :)
0,"Ah man super hostile maps brings be back to team canada days, i miss those videos"
0,6:00 thank god we still have the tissue box
0,Only Etho would make an automatic farm by shooting potions thru a Nether portal
0,May the algorithm bless you
0,"Congratulations on the new computer and monitor! Your setup looks great.

Hope that you have a wonderful day!"
40,"36:20 as a long time viewer, I’d LOVE to watch that kind of video"
0,Can you not use honey blocks to prevent the (baby)pigmen from jumping up?
0,"I felt fear when i saw the desk photo, Ethos not a real person in my head"
0,cant get a new setup cause etho dun it
0,Why don't you add some hoppers on the overworld to catch the gold ingots and the nuggets and just throw them through the portal along with the potion?
0,We finally got a new version of ethos lab!
132,Oh thank god the tissue box survived. It wouldn't be an Etho episode without the high quality sound dampening of the tissue box.
0,upload in higher bitrate pleaseeeeeeee
624,"I like that the blanket matches the colours of the desk setup, in the same way the tissue box does. Peak interior design right there"
5,"Etho, for all the time I’ve been watching you (at least 11 years bc I had the comment of the day on ep 313) you seems to be there in my life in a way that I need. Thanks for being someone super positive <3"
0,"hey, etho! i think the strategy of throwing a potion and switching to a looting sword might've been patched. they redid how a lot of enchantments work to enable data driven enchantments, and i believe looting swords no longer affect fired bow shots, and i think that applies to splash potions too. might be worth testing again!"
1,"Not sure if this was mentioned already but make sure your BIOS is up to date because the 14th gen Intel processors have some issues with degradation, and they push out some patches to help prevent issues. To my knowledge it’s more a problem with the i9 variant but it still doesn’t hurt to make sure you stay up to date with your i7 to prevent any issues down the line. Apparently they’re pushing out another patch soon because some people are still facing issues"
0,"Yer Offhand lass, dont forget about your OFFHANDDDD ITS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR 6 YEARSSSSSSSS PUT THE SWORD IN YOUR OFFHAND"
0,Do you play the guitar? pretty sure that was an amp if im not mistaken... it's incredibly cool if you do!
0,Is this a Etho first!? A real life picture shot edited into HIS video!?
0,hmm.. super hostile is good buuut cobblemon would be incredible :D
0,rtx 4060? a bit mid imo
0,"When I got my new computer, it was set up with windows 11. The first thing I did was change the settings so it looked like windows 10."
1,"7:19 Not Etho jumping off the edge, and flying over lava without rockets in his hot bar! It’s giving me Scar vibes. 😂"
0,You take care as well!
0,I'd be in fasvor of more 1 off videos - I loved the random Hearthstone episodes
0,Yes I think edited videos of those sort of maps are the way to go (& would love to watch them). If one of those episodes goes by and no or backwards progress has been made it can be a bit discouraging for the watcher I feel.
0,"Still so many questions about the setup. Please, how old is that keyboard? Get a nice mechanical one, you'd like it so much!

Also, what's the second mouse about? A backup??"
0,Etho got the rtx 1460 must be some special edition.
0,"Hey Etho, I see in the photo you have an amp under your desk, do you play electric guitar, or some other electric instrument? :)"
2,29:05 man dont make me feel old! Though Im only 22… it definitely could be much worse but still!
0,"Etho, IF you were a potion... what effect would you have?"
1,the tissue box stays LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!
0,"Sir, a ~~2nd~~ ~~3rd~~ ~~4th~~ 5th(?) gold farm redesign has hit the LP"
0,You just lost ~9 bottles its probably fine....
0,can you give us a list of stuff you did to change windows 11 to be good? That why im afraid of updating still... <3
0,"Make sure you make a couple of system restore disks in case you manage to corrupt the installation (on that new PC)! My family is very tech literate, but we all keep restore disks just in case."
0,Funny Etho spent so much time making an afk gold harvester considering he doesn't afk lol
0,"Gotta say the increase in quality is definitely noticable in the video qualify, there's far less artifacting when moving around."
1,I was thinking about superhostile recently too! I would love to see some content like that again
0,Computer nerd here just to let you know that your CPU may be destined for failure. Recent Intel CPUs have been notorious for a very high failure rate.
0,You could probably sell your 4060 for $600 and buy a 5070 for $900 and get about a 50% increase in power
0,I enjoyed the episode
0,"Hi non-redstoner here. Why wouldn’t you just use a dispenser to throw the potion? 

My understanding is that from the brewer the potions are dispensed into the entity sorter but why not just point the dispenser at the portal? Or send the potions through as items and the have a dispenser in the nether? I know there is some randomness in the dispensed entity’s direction but is that enough to make it unviable? Or is there some other game science that prevents it?"
0,"Hey, I ran through a bunch of comments. And I guess there is no reason to change it now. But you set the mob health to 1 with the fall damage. So no reason to make health II pots. Could cut the glowstone step of the brewer. Hope you are doing well and im a big fan of yours."
0,New monitor and computer? 1440p/4k soon? 👀
2,I think one-episode edited down super hostile videos would be super cool! It sounds like a lot of playtime and editing work for a single video but I'd love watching it.
1,"Windows 11 is honestly almost indistinguishable W10 if you configure correctly. The only thing that still annoys me is that the Start menu is now practically useless, and of course all the AI slop."
1,30:56 kinda criminal to do the recipe on the top instead of the bottom
3,YES an office chair blankie adds the perfect lil dash of cozy to a setup. big fan of that lil office upgrade!!
0,I do wonder what Vechs is up to these days.
0,"18:22 Just a thought, you could use the rotten flesh as your item to dispense into the portal to load the potions"
0,❤❤❤ etho post 😅
6,I know I speak for most of us at least those of us that have watch you we would love to see your pov of R.E.P.O. obviously I can't speak for the entire community but I think a fair number of people would justify you uploading it
0,"Etho! I love hearing you talk about your setup! You mentioned you got a new monitor but didn’t say what model or specs, what did you end up with? Are you ever going to make the jump to an OLED? I did earlier this year and it makes all the difference!"
0,"Oh, a thing for dealing with Windows weirdness, (I know it sounds weird) but I'd recommend ""O&O Shutup10++"", it really helps neuter some of windows 10 and 11's ""features"""
15,Whatever possible solution gets you to post you playing more maps is fine by me. A number of my all-time favorite etho videos/series are on custom maps.
0,That's Peavey Rage 158 TransTube Guitar Combo Amplifier launched in late 90s assuming he was a teenager like 15-20 when he bought it. Etho would be in his early 40s now.
74,"Etho you have one of the most kind and loyal fanbases of any MC youtuber, please don't think too much about the small differences in views. I'm sure 80% of us will watch you talk about bricks for 5 hours if you upload it. It would be so fun to see another superhostile map!!"
3,"You should totally consider recording those old maps. If you want to go a long form route, and perform well, they should probably be streamed. However, I think they could do really well on YouTube Shorts if you feel comfortable enough to try that out! I think the point of the videos should be to get people to try out the map, and you showcase all the cool aspects of the maps and not worry about showing every single thing. Keep up the great work!"
0,"I think one big ""supercut"" of a map is more enticing than 10 small episodes, personally. I'll skip a 20 minute video on a topic I like, just to watch a 7 hour supercut of some challenge on a game I've never played in my life."
127,"great episode etho, didnt even knew that 20 mins had passed until you said it, to me the episode was just starting at that point. i actually like that new potion brewer, always liked your design in the man cave, but is a design that you dont see replicated much even if i think is great (i think it has to do with potions not being that good in the game because of all the inventory space they take). now that i have seen a modern approach i maybe use it to make a giant brewer in my world.

other than that, im all for you doing other videos too,  im not a fan of the ""adventure"" maps myself, even if i have seen some series on them, but i did like that skyblock you did with pause and beef, a shame that it didnt have vein miner installed, but hey, you had minicio at least on that one as beef mentioned a couple times. it doesnt have to be with team canada, but maybe you could do another one like that too with a group, life series style"
0,"Long form content is for streams, so I think if you really wanted to play a SHM, then streaming it would be a good option, especially since you just got a new computer.

If you really wanted to edit a whole map into a single video, there is a guy called Hubble who edits whole mod packs into single videos which might contain some useful techniques for how to edit such a project."
0,"new computer thats cool

The real question is did you changed your mic stand?

EDIT - Ok you did not"
0,"ah dude legendary would be excellent, would love to see that. And some slower videos would honestly be welcome especially as a side-thing"
1,why do you need healing II potions when the pigman are one hp? Would healing I potions not work?
0,Why no more modded series?
0,if you're looking for a good CTM I played through Superstition by Ty a couple years ago and it was really good. It's hard but fair and pretty short.
1,"10:39 ""Do they go through the portal as they are falling? .... Looks like they're not pushing each other into it, so that's good!""
10:53 YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE A PIGMAN RIGHT THERE WHAT.. D:"
34,"I just wanted to mention, since you brought up the super hostile maps with that comment, Team Canda playing through Final Paradox was so much fun while it lasted. My siblings and I played along too and oh man, people are so creative! That one and Diversity 3 have been recent(ish) ones that I just loved to both watch and play along with. Thanks for the great video as always!"
0,I did like the old one off videos. It would be fun to see them make a comeback
0,"So I haven't played mc in a little while, and haven't build a machine like this so I may be uninformed, but it seemed like some of the ""misfires"" where it didn't kill all the pigmen just happened to shoot the potion right as the pigmen jumped. Maybe it happened to hit a pigmen that jumped instead of the middle causing the pigmen on the other side to be out of the range of the splash."
1,"personally i'd love to see another super hostile map play through, was some of my favorite stuff from back in the day. <3"
1,i was not ready for the nvidia rtx 1460
0,The potion going through the portal and a nugget instantly jumping back was hilarious
2,I’m guessing the reason some of the potions didn’t kill all the pigmen is because it happened to hit one of the bouncing pigmen instead of the pillar
293,I was not expecting the Victorian ankle reveal of that desk pic. My poor heart. For heavens sake warn us first ;D
1,"Hey Etho, do you have plans to play a Soulsborne game on your channel, if you are famiilar with those? Perhaps for a miniseries or a challenge run? Recently I have been really into watching Dark Souls challenge runs, and I think the clever use of game mechanics and planning it takes to play with the restrictions would be right up your alley! 
A Horror game could also be fun, I have never seen a scared Etho.
Thank you :-D"
0,would love those small side videos  showing cool maps or whatnot maybe just your recent ingame goofs too!
0,Etho setup is SSS+
0,Resin blocks are really nice for pillaring and bridging as they are insta breakable with even your fist. You might be able to make a creaking farm with the potion auto clicker.
0,farming pigmen for gold and then trading it back to em gotta be a different type of evil lmao.
1,the CTM's I always go back to watch ❤
171,"If you do the superhostile map, please consider uploading the full VOD on a separate channel. I see a lot of streamers do this, where they have an edited version on their main Youtube channel and the many hours of unedited gameplay is put on their second channel. That way you can get the fast-pace edited version, but those of us who enjoy watching you stumble around for an hour can do so."
0,You need to make a big witch hut to house your new potion machine!
0,"Hope you also updated the bios, because there is an issue with 14th gen Intel CPUs that can cause permanent damage if you don't 🫡"
2,"Editing it all into one video would definitely be better. There's another Youtuber named Smallant that did a lot of that with his streams to make one cohesive video, whether it was Minecraft, Pokemon, or probably some other games that I haven't watched lol. It definitely requires more effort but people wouldn't mind a longer video like that since they could watch it in one sitting rather than having to wait for multiple episodes, watching the downtime, etc."
0,2 of the same mice on top of the desk certainly is a choice
0,"Hi Etho, thank you for the video! I'd love to see you do more maps or just other one off videos, it's always fun to watch and even if it's in a long format it's nice to have it on in the background while doing other things. I was wondering how you remember all your redstone contraptions? I'm not the best at Redstone and need to watch a video each time I'm trying something but you seem to have a knack for memorising mechanics or tools to get you by. Do you memorise the majority of them or do you have a cheat sheet that you refer to?"
2,Seeing ethos chair after all these years feels surreal
1093,Why didnt you use a dispenser to load the water column with healing potions?
0,New etho vid lets gooooooo

1,we have been blessed with another Etho let's play episode.
1,"I got an idea.

Right now people also watch Minecraft for stories told in the game. Scripted or not! (See Whitepine for a good scripted story in Minecraft.)

If you want Super Hostile to work, you could make an engaging story, or a ARG with bits of it in each episode to get the community engaged and to guess what is going on."
2,Etho getting a new PC! I've never been more excited for someone upgrading!
1,Ergo!!!! My day just got so much better
1,"I doubt this will happen any time soon between hermitcraft and the lets play series and appearing in streams, but next time Etho's in need of a series... I suggest vintage story :D it's like terrafirmacraft, but its own game, and more in depth!"
0,@etho i think the second shot didnt hit all pigman because one of them was jumping and the potion it that instead of the middle column.
0,Would love to watch another superhostile E
10,"I would ABSOLUTELY love to see you play a super hostile map, even without a super tight editing style"
0,Etho would you ever consider releasing VODs along side these edited down videos? Love your content :]
3,"Etho, have you thought of making a smelter for the left over gold swords?  It might help with some lag too. 33:07"
894,"Etho! Regarding the comment of the day - we would love to have more random goofy videos. It's true that people watch minecraft for creative ideas, but some people watch minecraft simply for the creators behind it (and their sparkling personalities). All that said I hope you do end up playing through legendary and I know we would really enjoy it."
8,"Hey etho, thanks for always being yourself over the years. I've been watching you for years now, it's good to see your still here up and running around."
6,"Early Etho video on my birthday, love to see it"
8,Always a good Day when Etho uploads.
0,Bro got a rtx 4060 🗿🗿🗿
0,Etho!! :D
0,lunch break can't get any better when etho uploads
1,"Have you ever considered a purely create themed mod pack series? Being known for your technical and Redstone abilities, I would think it would be right up your alley no? Awesome video as always, happy to see the tissue box mic still standing lol"
0,I love ALL EthosLab videos!
33,Wait that's a guitar amp in the cabinet.. Etho plays guitar?! Huge new Etho lore drop!
0,Etho has Amp? Etho play us a song!!!
5,Good vid etho! Never thought we’d get to see your office setup 😂
1,why cant there just be a dispenser set up in place of the slime block launcher? I feel like that would simplify this a lot more
0,Is the potion portal issue due to the potion hitting the mobs first? Maybe try honey blocks on the sides to prevent some jumping? Unsure how you'd fix that.
0,"The new pc looks awesome etho, Love the RGB fans in the front :))"
0,"I would have hopped you getting 16 gb vram gpu so it can work for more years , also should have used nvme drive for the os to be much fater"
0,Slabber Gang Check
4,Nothing like an Etho video to brighten my day when I’m sick at home!
4,"Damn, i used to watch everly single Ethos video 10 years ago. Incredible that he has kept this series going. Dude you brought me so much joy back when I was in school."
0,but can it run crysis?
4,"Hey etho! I noticed you had an amp below your new computer. Do you play any instruments? Love the videos, been watching for years!"
0,6:00 He has two mouses on his desk???
0,Use an animal detection system. So only when you are at the enderman farm does it run.
0,I'm sorry you got an intel cpu instead of an AMD ryzen
0,"I could be mistaken, but I believe that the tool switch for things like looting has been fixed for a little while already.

I'm pretty sure that it at least doesn't work for arrows anymore, but I could be mistaken."
1,Bios update the motherboard.  Intel chips were/are breaking themselves.
4,"Not played this game in years, barely watch YouTube, but I’ll always be right here for an Etho video."
229,i think it's so wild that superhostile maps never really got the views to justify making them - i distinctly remember being really excited for new episode day back when y'all were doing them more often! so sad the views didn't translate from the way i'm sure a dedicated part of the fanbase felt about them. i'd personally love to see an edited-down one-off playthrough. the nostalgia would be so real!
0,He made a trap through the portals 🔥
0,"Hey Etho, I have a question for you that my friends and I have mulled over a few times in the past. If you could replace a body part with the equivalent of that from any animal, what would you chose and what animal would you take it from? (ex. replace my arms with octopus tentacles because each tentacle has it's own brain, in a sense, making multitasking easy).

Love your videos and I've been watching since I was in middle school. I'm now married and have been watching your videos with my wife every night to show her all your cool inventions and creations. And yes, we have snacks every time!"
3,Hell yeah it's Etho time
0,"Etho, I have a humble request regarding your new computer: could you record, render or upscale to 4K? It may take a little more time (maybe not so much with your new PC :))  but it looks a lot better! Especially with Youtube compression"
1,Oh snappers
0,"A very humble and cozy setup, I love it. Glad your new PC is treating you well."
0,whew!! this is the earliest i've been ^^ great to hear from you again etho!
1,I have coffee mugs that are a similar blue color. I also drink coffee with cream at my desk. I feel so seen.
0,"I would love a Legendary revisited, pls ergo❤"
0,thanks for the prompt drop.
19,6:13 we're going to see that picture all over Reddit for weeks again xD
113,"""Yupyup! So imagine I'm a potion, I'm gunna ram right into the wall here."" 

Oh Etho, you're already the health potion ramming into our hearts 🫶😎"
0,1 episode a month and we'll start 202 6 with episode 6 00
0,at this point the tissue box will never leave because we made the fundamental mistake of telling him how much we hate it 😹
4,Graduating tomorrow and this is just what I need to calm my nerves
1,Etho!! Don’t think I wouldn’t notice that amp! Do you play guitar?! 🎸
14,"That Peavy brings me back. My first amp ever in the 80's, I think it was a Backstage Plus. Grats on the new rig!"
1,I have noticed hopper clocks don't work anymore as they used to. Now I have to update the piston for it to push over the redstone block. It seemed to work fine though in your enderman farm.
1,A new Etho episode is the best thing to watch while eating breakfast!
1,at 6:10 is that a guitar or bass amp? how long have you been playing?
0,Just coming back after a long while. What ever happened to your modded Let's Play?
249,"My god. The genuine joy I feel, listening to this man talk about a folded blanket. Words cannot describe."
59,5:55 THE BOX LIVES ON🔥
0,I don't even have snacks and I'm still gonna go find some
0,So uh... Does the tissue box was still on your setup?
1,Wow I'm so early. Etho thank you for being here for so long I'm nearly 30 and have a child of my own now.
2,"My favorite number is 592, always knew Etho would get there eventually!"
1,"keeping the tissue box is unironically better than the cpu choice :( poor etho got basically scammed, hopefully his cpu doesn't die soon"
4,ETHO PIC #3 THIS IS A MOMENTOUS DAY
0,"THANK GOD THE TISSUE BOX MADE IT :D
and the superhostile idea sounds super interesting, but yeah it sounds like a massive editing challenge!"
175,Ergo does not exceed 4 folds in his office chair blanket. I can’t handle so much etho lore in such a short period of time!
8,The office chair quilt is lovely
19,Hey etho! I just wanted to thank you for all the years of wonderful videos! I’m so grateful that you’ve stuck around after all these years!
1,19:06 I know it’s usually fun and efficient to use tnt but you can fortune glow stone!
0,i hope we hear about that shulker box computer thing etho talked about once many many moons ago. i wonder if it just ended up being not possible?
10,"0:47 Etho, please consider making a video about your customization on Windows 11.

I am sure I am not alone in valuing your unique creativity and approaches to problem solving.

Currently dreading the forced migration in October."
37,Etho plays guitar confirmed
1,Woah ep 592  I can't remember when was the last time I saw an episode but I would have imagined that we would have been in 700s or more by now. I feel like ep 500 was ages ago.
0,He got a new set up but didn’t mention a new mic stand lol.. I’m guessing the tissue box is still working fine.
0,MY BODY HURTS MY LUNGS ACHE WDYM ETHO PIC DROP
1,ETHOOOOOOO VIDEOOOO YEEEE
0,A 20mil per hour gold nugget farm is about to launch if etho is too worried for gold production
0,"Gotta get my snacks!
Edit: I would also love to see some old adventure maps or CTMs! Those were the best content to ever come from Minecraft, imo"
2376,"man i was 15 when i first found Etho, 26 now and i still get just as excited for an LP upload."
1,"Dear Ergo, i wish you would return to your old schedule, so that we can get to episode 1000 by the end of next year."
45,6:01 etho plays guitar!!!! crazy lore
0,<3
0,"Etho please look into an ergonomic chair, you spend a third of your day at least in there, you should look after your back health"
0,etho can u officiate my wedding?
0,Hello
2,Did you get a new keyboard though
33,Etho with a massive new computer and monitor setup! …But still the tissue box mic. Love it
1,today is a good day
0,Let's goooo
11,"Ah Etho time, best part of any day.   Got my snacks, work is done.  Perfection."
1,ITS AN EFFO EPISODE
5,I hope this doesn't sound weird but Etho is the first gaming YouTuber ever buying a _new_ computer with lower specs than mine...
1343,"6:12 Etho is just a dude in his office chair with a folded blanked on it and a tissue box as a mic stand
slurping his coffee and playing Minecraft.

Gota love that Guy"
2,I've never been this early to and Etho episode before. I feel blessed
1,NEW ETHO PIC?
6,Glad the tissue box is still with us
4,"ah, yes. finally, an oasis has been found after my days of walking in the desert."
0,First
1,ergo
9,THE WAY MY FROWN WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN!! made my day thatnks Etho <3
6,He’s always there just when we need him! 🎉
4,"QOTD: Have you considered using Linux? It's a bit telling that you had to make several changes to make Windows 11 feeling good to you. Lots of people, including myself have concerns about many Windows 11 ""features"", such as the start menu ads, recall, copilot, telemetry, etc. Linux doesn't seem to have any of that, and I've heard that most games now even play better on it, including Minecraft."
3,"Glad to hear you've grown accustomed to Windows 11! Hopefully it lasts, although your history with the various OS quirks is entertaining (in some way haha)"
2,My Ethoooooooo.
0,"I assume you mean a Nvidia 4060. That still seems wrong with the performance. That's great performance out of a 4060.

Edit: He shows his F3 screen and it is a 4060."
0,Yippeee
7,"Etho fanboys and fangirls, wake up! Etho posted!"

3,Had to drop what I was doing to watch. Today is a great ❤
4,It's Etho at work time!

0,yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

9,Mr. Slab. I was JUST about to go to bed!
0,WOO

3,ETHO!!!
2,yay new video!
1,Yes
10,15 views in 14 hours? The video isn’t popping up on the channel just in this playlist
117,this playlist is so good for sleep thank you etho pls never explode
107,I'm going to binge this playlist
0,It's to bad you can't just make a sound barrier/ sound room to block game sounds like mobs or dispensers and dropers
0,"Yep. When you have an idea for something it often takes a bunch of testing and iterations whether for functionality or esthetics. It's easy to just see the finished product and miss the heavy work, thinking and trial and error that goes into things. One of the reasons I enjoy your channel is that you show how your ideas evolve as you test them."
0,"I recommend playing Minecraft on Linux, so much performance boost. I used to get stutters and heat problems (on laptop) when I used to play on Windows now it's all gone. I use Arch, Ryzen 5600H, GTX 1650 mobile 4VRAM 24GB RAM"
0,Find you someone that loves you as much as Etho loves that tree farm (which of course he loves so much because it lets him make so many ladders)
0,Crazy to think I have a better computer (although older) than Etho is getting.
5,31:08 Etho just casually time lapsing himself making the hole while everyone is killing Jimmy. 😂
0,33:02 that's actually hilarious
0,rock bottom = bad dropper levels
0,"22:40 I remember reading on some Minecraft wiki that bone-mealing a 2x2 tree requires applying it to the correct sapling.  I don't remember the specific rule, but it was something like ""the sapling at the HIGHEST X and Z coordinate"" (or lowest) is the tree you need to apply to in order to accelerate the growth.  Any other tree doesn't help it grow.  Watching this, it was the ""right"" (direction, not correctness) sapling when they grew.  This is decades old information but it stuck with me.  Little details stick with me."
0,"30:38 use the pig 🐷 as a checkpoint/ safety net or something by putting a saddle on it’s back so that the hermits have to time the right click, just a idea 💡. Hope it helps:)"
0,"whats your favourite indie game etho? any suggestions, new or old?"
0,💙💙💙
0,would you mind makeing a tutorial to the ultra fast kelp farm
0,"Etho... We just want you to upload. Don't think so hard lol. Seriously man, I've been watching you for like 15 dang years."
0,You should add a hidden pop up shop at the very top with prices that are half the cost of the ones at the bottom
0,"Can you make a roomba by having an armor stand with a helmet going around in front of the hopper minecart by the tree farm? 

Not sure if it would fit the place, just a theoretical question."
0,Etho you got your prebuilt from Costco didn’t you? Lol
0,"Some mischievous things to do around the Hermitcraft server,
put glass panes at flying height in most of the beacons, (esp. the spawn ones)
put a few tastes of scaffolding around Bdubs builds
put some giant eyebrows rocklee style on Scars zoo entrance (the one already pranked with eyeballs)
send a letter addressed to each hermit delivered to the wrong hermit (thinking some quick lore drop or positive/constructive comment on their latest video, so the hermit who receives it will want to forward it or see the reference, viewers will watch like a hawk filling out a spreadsheet)"
0,"Lat thing, I just heard was Etho turned down ""Corner  Gas""' even though a child of  an actor loves Etho, still does."
0,Has anyone done a tutorial for Etho's new zero tick kelp farm? I'm not quite proficient enough to be successful off just his explanation here and I'm not finding one in search results almost 3 weeks after the video came out. I have never done zero tick before and I'm curious to try it.
0,"not gonna lie i was just exploring the season 9 map and fell into the tree farm hole wondering what it was, thought i was getting pranked till i saw this LOL"
0,"Hey Etho, any plan on the fishing rod arena for the fight club that Pearl invited you to? Wondering if you forgot since it has been a while."
0,I am not a fan of win11 at all.  I recommend linux mint.  Most games are seamless these days.
0,"22:30 I know it's been a week, but it's surprising that Etho doesn't know that only a specific corner of 4x4 trees grow quickly."
0,Your the only one I watch from HC anymore an only the let's play series i think they did iskall dirty an ppl may disagree but I dont 😢
0,They can make it a countinues steam of white noise or it can be an a single tick at random times. 11:43
2,I seriously want to watch the building process of these types of things from scratch!! 1:52
0,GPU prices so bad they even have Etho down.
0,So $1600 car is like $600 usd right? Just kidding but I do feel bad when Canadians talk about their dollars and I look up the conversion
0,Just came to say you inspired my creative mind and joy for this game when I was younger and growing up
0,Pierre-fond!? Lac des deux montagnes!?
0,"I think the tree bone making has to do with your distance to the saplings. The game won’t spawn it if it’s too close, it needs the right amount of space, but if the player blocks it, it won’t grow."
0,DeckedOut 2 was just last season? Man i feel old
1,Hope you're enjoying the new computer! Glad you got yourself an upgrade ❤
0,"The ""what-if questions"" thing absolutely gets me too. Only I never even make it out of the mental design phase before I trip over about six of them. :D

I really like the game idea, and it was nice to see a blast from the past in the form of that tree farm. I still think it's a really impressive build, and I've started watching quite a few dedicated builders since.

That window into farm design was really cool. Even that just hinted at the really cool stuff you know about redstone, and to me starts to edge into the highly technical stuff like CubicMetre's orbital TNT cannons. I really would like to hear more about how these work and the actual game mechanics that power them (needing to break the kelp in three places was actually something I guessed the cause for, but the zero-tick stuff is mysterious). It's sad that we as a community have gotten a rep of yelling ""XYZ invented it first"" (and on the other hand the occasional plagiarist) where we no longer get these design videos."
0,The Rock Bottom game reminds me of those Dropper maps so much
0,Why wouldn't you just upgrade the computer you have???? You just straight up bought a whole new one? I thought you were Canadian not a wasteful American...
0,"I know I’m late on this, but at 22:30 I’m *pretty* sure there is one sapling the game dedicates as the “growing” one, so only one of the saplings is able to be bonemealed to consistently grow"
0,"Looking forward to seeing the new game, love your games"
0,"Etho, id love to see your perspective from the 3D among us! Seems you didnt get imposter too too much, but still ; i love watching among us and from your perspective would be awesome."
0,Sounds like a cool idea!
0,"Etho, how will you organize the new items added to the game to your shulker storage?"
2,"27:37 *@EthosLab*
For your rock store, it needs to be located in some kind of ravine or similar, so you REALLY can call it ""Rock BOTTOM"" (preferably IN OR under The Bedrock) :D
30:08 Hay bales."
0,Not sure if anyones asked you this but have you tried Vintage Story playing it gives me nostalgia from you're Terra Firma mod pack you did a while back it feels like something you would enjoy Etho!
0,"Hi Etho, just wondering if you've considered doing another modded series again, because we love them, well, I do anyway. Also what's with the house in creative? it looks gorgeous from what I could see of it. Why haven't you built it on HermitCraft. If you did sorry I missed it"
0,anyone else think Rock E's Bottom would be better for your shop name
0,"Hey Etho! I’m a graphic designer and a big fan of your work. I’d love to offer you some free custom thumbnails that could boost engagement on your vids. Happy to show samples if you’re interested—no pressure at all!

— Emmanuel"
2,"Hey Etho, I was messing around with your Endless Storage room idea, and I found an optimization. Instead of the hopper clock thing you made below the rails, all you have to do is comparator test the cart for when it's full. If it's full, send it up the elevator. It's that simple! It's like how you want to keep the buffer hoppers full of items before placing the shulker. Before the transfer of items to the buffer hoppers, you want the cart to be full. I posted this comment in Chaos to Order too but wasn't sure if you would read it, so I posted it here too."
0,"I don't buy new computers. I just buy better components to my existing computer. Currently the only original parts in my computer are case, power supply and the optical drive that I don't have any use for. The last upgrade was just a couple weeks ago when I doubled my ram from 16 to 32 gigabytes by filling the rest of my ram slots because I currently play a minecraft modpack that leaks memory so I want to give it 10 gigabytes so I don]'t have to restart it every half an hour and 16 gigs total wasn't enough for that."
0,💗💜💗
0,What if you played ark again?
0,"Honestly etho, you could upload more of the building and day to day server life, I don't think I'm the only one that absolutely loves it when I see and etho video, don't think I've ever started an episode and not finished it. It's you we look forward to watching, the content of the video will always be good if you're recording, talking and being you! #moreetho"
0,Sooo it's a dropper game?
1,idk what to say the fact that etho was gaming on a 2060 or that fact he over paid for a 4060 build
1,"Now two more months and we will get another episode. If a hernitcraft season lasts two years, that would be like 12 etho episodes!"
0,"I was expecting someone to have an explanation about the tree growing in the comments, disappointed lol"
0,YIPPEE ETHO VIDEO
0,36:50 If I want a movie I’ll watch a movie -Ethoslab 2025
0,"I mean a HC video per 2 months and a LP video per 2 months yeah I’d say you’re lacking a little bit, (don’t worry etho we understand that life has been kicking you in the butt recently and that’s 100% okay.) but I am agreeing with you on your statement."
0,ima new sub i love your voice man so soothiung
0,the ceiling of that secret base could not be more joel
0,"Wait, does this mean you are going to employ a new tissue box for sound??? 😮"
0,"Etho, I like your shows. I have a question about the rocket shop. How is it going?"
0,"Etho, what’s your frog’s name?"
0,30:27 the very first contestant for the new game!
0,great ep <3
0,"I think the permits were a great idea, the problem kind of started with banning pop up shops. Most hermits end up building bigger eventually anyway"
0,start a create mod series
0,"We need to petition either an ability to turn the dropper/dispenser noise off, or just delete it altogether"
0,"I long for the day where we see more content like Project Ozone 2, I've watched the series twice now and I'm just starting my 3rd watch. Is there any chance we will see another FTB pack playthrough? I'd love to see you tackle something more modern."
0,"I love how etho seemlessly missed the entirety of the server wide story event. Exactly the same as last season,😂"
0,The way this feels alive is something only Bdubs and Hoodking usually pull off.
0,It's real easy you just turn off all start up applications in task manager and then reboot then find any other hidden startup programs including browser that aren't essential for start up. Sacrifice isn't a term for computers I guess some people really love going super slow watching everything at 100X speed.....
0,37:30 Etho casually dropping a window pun and pretending like it didn't happen.
0,"Have any of the Hermits tried Iskalls Mission Possible Tasks since his removal from the franchise..... It can, I guess you should quarantine his and Stresses builds..... Maybe find a hidden quest along the way......"
0,I think the 2x2 sapling bonemealing is also dependant on which corner you bonemeal (world direction) - I believe for some directions the saplings count as an obstacle for some reason?
0,"many have mentioned the sapling bug but I don't remember seeing the issue number posted, so here it is MC-8187"
0,"…wait, why does my current computer sound eriely similar to ethos? 14th gen intel, 4060, 32 gigs of ram…."
1,"I thought comments would flood asking what's your pc components are, but you instantly fulfilled the curiosity, not being afraid of roasting about the choice and prices. I personally very much appreciate it xD"
0,33:52 I'm shooketh. Congrats new PC 😂🙌
0,"Wow! You do all this video editing and rendering and you were still only working with 16 GB of RAM? Dang dude. Get yourself to 64, skip right past 32 at this point, lol."
0,The  awkward hermit challenge find....... yeeeeeeaaaaaa. Iskall85 rises from the dead
0,❤
0,"Etho I’m sad to say windows 11 is terrible, I wish I could go back"
0,"2000 Canadians for a computer sounds a little bit expensive, Etho."
0,heck yeah!! indie gamer Etho!!
0,Oof yikes. Uhm etho I have windows 10 and I don’t upgrade it to windows 11 because it apparently has a lot of problems for gamers and games not sure exactly what kind of games.
0,"Congrats on your new computer. I always built my self, but that's because i really enjoy the process."
0,"maybe trees cannot be bone-mealed in the night? Just a guess, tho"
0,"Ideas for the game:

Dripstone for death traps
Dispensers that shoot people with levitation arrows/potions (or slow falling) to slow people down"
0,we have the same pc lmao
0,I think etho underestimates how excited we get with his redstone
0,"1 year, 14 episodes ?!"
0,"I have dreams about etho uploads, nothing makes my day like seeing this guy being silly"
0,Start11 rocks for undoing Windows 11's start menu. There's also a registry hack to turn odd the simplified right click menus. Those were my two biggest gripes.
0,"Etho, tomorrow my membership badge is removed as I have hit my own rock bottom and can no longer afford any extras over the bare necessities. 

This isn't meant to be a sad comment but an achievement that I was able to support you from the very beginning you opened up memberships.

I hope others will continue to support you monetarily for a long time to come. I will support by continuing to watch. 

Thanks for sharing your creativity with us."
1,I can't be the only one that saw Etho put in the TNT destroying diamonds lol Etho never changes
0,etho bought an intel cpu in 2025 💀
0,"Love your vids Etho
1440p60 would be nice by the way 👀"
0,"Was eyeing your specs every time you pressed F3 😂was wondering when you'll update your computer, you finally did it !! Congrats"
0,I love windows 11. Tabs in terminal and file explorer is 100% the best part
0,Please update your channel description when you get the chance! New specs time :)
0,Does the new computer come with a new tissue box? 😏
0,"13:25 maybe add dark oak or spruce fences in front of the stripped jungle log, so that it runs parallel to the dark oak wood on the right. That way there is a lower contrast making that line less sharp.
Also going off of your Windows 11 mention at the end, would you ever consider Linux? I know a lot of people are switching because of Windows 11 and are having a decent time, especially since Valve's proton can run most windows game fine without a performance hit. On top of that I'm pretty sure your editing and recording software (OBS and davinci resolve) have linux native versions. I'm just curious if you had any thoughts on that.

Personally I'm sitting on Windows 10 until I can't anymore, then I might try 11 but I will also try mint or putting together something in arch or base debian, depending on my energy level lol"
1,"I think for rock bottom it would be pretty fun to have some sort of hail Mary where there's a big drop into a 1x1 of water, but the catch is its so far down or not well-lit that you cant tell if a redstone randomiser has pushed up a pane of blue glass that kills you instantly when you land"

0,"ive been using macs all my life and i looveee them, but my sister and i decided to get a windows PC for gaming since thats what everyone recommended. i dont know if it works better but I do miss my mac lol"

0,awww you deserve the new pc etho
0,"If you new to windows 11, there are 2 settings to change. Arrange task bar icons Left. Also download a .reg file that restores classic context menu's. Because right click looks terrible."
0,"Maybe the 2nd tree and further trees might grow quicker because the first tree creates block updates from it's leaves, which refresh saplings and increasing their growth checks."
1,"I've noticed that the 2x2 trees need to grow in a certain order, otherwise you'll just waste bonemeal"

I'll add that I enjoyed the times you played other games, like SOTS: The pit and Cube world. And one of my favorite builds was your tamagatchi wall, as well as making the cave nicer and nicer. Glad you popped up in my head, love ya and keep up the awesome content."

0,You know its bad when etho is talking abour the economy
0,Why is solidarity here?
0,"$1600 CAD for just a 14700k, 32GB DDR5, and 4060 is a scam. Even if $1600 is post tax, $1415+tax for that is still a scam. Techpowerup puts 4060 relative performance increase from the 2060 at about 38% more performance. I salvaged old parts from my old PC, bought a 7700x+32GB DDR5 6000 CL30+B650 combo off Canada Computers for $530+tax. 5070ti for $1199+tax. Reused old PSU, case, SSD. Puts me $1729+tax. Had GTX1080 which is equivalent to 2060 in performance. Got 340% more GPU performance with my upgrade from 1080 to 5070ti."
0,unfortunately windows 11 is definetly worse than windows 10 but i heard windows 10 is gonna get its last ever security update soon so dont really got a choice
0,I like seeing the design process of builds. also enjoy the new pc!
0,"I think you had the perfect formart for season 7 of Hermitcraft. The combination of cute catchy noteblock music and a mini montage of you grinding/farming,building, exploring was very nice. Didn’t have to be a “special build” 


Maybe try and return to that format if you are unsure about what projects to show."
0,the rock bottom shop idea is rly awesome!! I can’t wait to see what it looks like as a final build :0 enjoy your new computer!!!!!
0,"22:17 Etho, i dunno if it's different on a server as I only play solo, but when trying to bonemeal 2x2 saplings, pick the north-west ""corner"" sapling, and it will almost always instantly grow.
GERTZ™ on the new computer. i have to admit i'm more than a bit jealous. Hope you enjoy it. and looking forward to the next crisp episode. :D"
0,Make a wind charge shop above the rock bottom and call it sky high.
0,new computer!! so can the modded series come back now? xD
0,"Rock bottom is going to feature that cave pig you freed, right?"
0,I can't help but notice that your trees started growing as soon as you targeted one of the inner saplings instead of the outer saplings
0,"I'm looking at a similar jump in computer this year. My current computer is almost identical to your last one. Definitely interested in how the setup goes and especially what you think of Win11, I might just give up and finally commit to linux instead."

0,"I don't really watch the Hermitcraft series but my withdrawal symptoms from the let's play are getting to me so I'm here. Etho, you are amazing. 30:56 sent me so hard hahahahahah"
0,Changed audio setup? New tissue box!?!?
0,"For me, Etho always seemed like that kind of guy who would build his own PC and have it running on Linux. I still wonder, though, if you're interested in setting it up using Linux."

0,do not windows 11.....
0,I physically jumped  the moment I saw that minecart move. I'm really surprised you made it out of there in time.
0,"i think you could add a risk vs reward decision making by adding Piston Walls that pushes the player off in sections of the wall where it looks too smooth.
because i think in those smooth sections the player will see a clear path to where they could drop down but also the risk where they could get pushed off if not timed right."
3,"It is insane that Etho has been running 2060...
He could take a 1time sponsor for some gaming company & get himself a decked out 5090 mega machine.
Etho is a frugal man."

0,Etho is a confirmed Oilers fan! Said Moss Pit way too many times to not be.
0,did i hear that right? new mic? what will happen to the cleanex box?
0,Have you thought about getting linux on your new computer? Or at least dual booting. Minecraft specifically runs flawlessly on linux and support for most games is really good nowadays too.
0,"I thought the video title came in because you hit rock bottom 💀😭, not that you were selling rocks for rock bottom prices"
1,"A new computer, whats next a new keyboard. Crazy"
0,Smart move on the PC specs. Even if you wanted to play AAA games on PC most developers don't even try to optimize their games anymore. Even with a beefy computer you're probably still not going to be able to run them without mods. Might as well buy a console.

I'm playing with the create mod and was making a farm for jungle wood and was noticing the same thing about the trees.
I tried using bonemeal to jumpstart the farm and get more saplings. 
I thought I was doing something wrong."
0,22:45 etho you have already pointed out how certain saplings won’t work with the bone meal because of the north or east(?) saplings

0,will the tissuebox stay?
2,"Consider adding shulkers to Rock Bottom, having their projectiles chase you could make for fun gameplay, and it's quite punishing if you get hit when your objective is to go down, not up!"

0,Aaaah yeah I should get a new PC and you've reminded me how much I don't want to set up a new windows 🙃I altered 10 in a bunch of ways that I have 0 memory of but I know I'll miss my changes when they are gone! GL with yours!
0,Cool new computer. I recommend the steam version of dwarf fortress if you never played the original.
0,"An RTX 4060 can be a solid choice in the mid range, though a bit expensive for its performance depending on the price you got. But the 14th gen Intel Core (13th also to a certain extent) were prematurely self-deleting. Though the i9s were far worse then i7s, I'm almost certain the 14700 is within the group with issues (the i5s and i3s seemed to be more stable). But I could be wrong.
Granted that the updated microcode should allegedly solve the issues, only not mitigating the already damaged parts of cpus that were more used and suffered degradation.
I don't mean to scare you, if you were outside the loop on the hardware issues, but a warning to check with your builder is a matter of ethics in my book.
I personally have been going full team red in the last 7 years because of the price and performance balance, plus the excessive milking from nVidia and Intel, which pisses me off. But single-threading might give Intel an advantage depending on the price and cpu, so that can be very important in most games. But Ryzen has locked in the multi-threaded performance even in AM4 and seems to be looking fine in AM5. (without automatic driver updates, though, since I had some weirdness with that recently)."
0,"Hey Etho! I like the Rock Bottom game idea.  I wonder if you’ve designed it in a way that more levels can be added later? You could even invite the other hermits to contribute levels if the design is simple enough.  Probably there’s not space in the shopping district, but a collaborative game could be neat idea for another time. Extend the lifespan etc. cheers"
0,that's a solid pc etho im not 100% sure how much Canadian money is compared to my own but I see it's a good bit below usd and that's a solid price for what you got.
8,"36:05 Etho, 14700 i7 14th gen intel CPU's have known issues with voltage and require microcode updates in your BIOS so be sure to take care of your new intel CPU by checking for any bios updates when you get it! I found out the hard way about my own 13700k i7 13th gen that has the same issues in my new prebuilt computer when it didn't have the microcode updates!

 I will post a source from Intel in the comments, but you should only have to check for BIOS updates for your motherboard when you get your new PC to be fine.

I love your videos! I have watched since the mindcrack days! 

Etho girlies stay winning!!!"
0,"you'll probably hate windows 11 if 10 was starting to become an issue for you. just in my experience though. without getting into politics or privacy, its still a mess. the only thing i found a good resolve for was how to reset the right click menu by editing the registry. if privacy is a big concern for you, absolutely do not install 11. besides windows, i'd only recommend linux, which i'm sure you'd have no problem setting up and i'm sure you're aware of it's limitations. it runs minecraft no problem and i think video editting is as easy but idk. other games may have some problems, however now that steam came out with proton it's a managable reality, but i've never used either. good luck etho!"

0,There's some missing pieces of that Season 9 rebuild specifically at the roof. I'm curious if this is lazy Etho not wanting to do the hanging vine lights or if this was a redesign to help include the new skylights? XD
0,"Hey Etho! OG fan here ;) I remember when you gave shout out to Cpt Sparkles and Coe for the first time, and I had no idea who it was!  😂 Speaking of Jordan: maybe it would be a good idea for you to create a second channel, where you could stream and publish VODs? Could be in combination with Twitch streaming? Another good stream of revenue for you and a chance for us, your fans, to see you more often? I.e. your fishing adventure would be nice to follow live ;) Anyways, love your work and it is great to see you posting!"

I like how all of yall make it easier to hang out with one another. I hope your new computer works out quickly for ya. I found the win11 learning curve not too bad, and it's easy enough to customize what you need it to do"
1,Etho are we ever gonna see you upload more than once a month can you please address this because we all love you and your vids and just wanna see more of you and it’s so hard to wanna continue watching your series when it’s almost pointless because it takes so long for vid please upload more or address this love you etho

1,"Hey Etho, just to forewarn you about the newer Intel processors, there is an issue causing the processor to have permanent damage or burnout due to excessive voltage.  I personally experienced it with games such as COD and Warhammer, and really any other graphically intensive games that caused the game to crash.  There is a fix that I had to do which involved changing a few settings in my BIOS.  For reference, I have an i7-13700KF.  For more information, you can google i7 14000 burnout."
0,what are ethos top 5 games???
0,"Love the idea of rock bottom!
Im currently working on a base in a minecraft realm where i live in a 25 wide hole in the ground. Going from Y120 to Y-50.
Im going to build it in layers with them being 20 blocks long.
So every 20 blocks you go up or down you get a different theme! My main goal is to make it fun to go up and down while also keeping things functional.
So far ive got riptide trident things going, but if there is too much water where you can safely land then it isn't as fun(i want my friends to die trying to navigate my base).

This has multiple efects. Base requires minimal horizontal lighting and space(everyone livss close together), base defense(no one really has feather falling yet), the ability to get to any part of the base fast without elytra(they like playing in peaceful so i can't reach the end currently), and most importantly, it is going to be my most complex build creatively.

Can't wait to see how you allow people to go down! Maybe there could also be traps that send you up?

Anyway have a great day!"
0,"In Ravager Rush, there's a repair to make to the froglight purchase area.  Joe used one of the bubble columns as an ender pearl stasis chamber, and Tango moved a lilypad to activate it.  But they both forgot to fix it, and Joel's recent video showed it was still unfixed."

0,I grew up with etho and everytime he uploads i get my snacks and watch :)
0,"22:24 dont know why bonemeal isnt consistent, but regular tree growth is pretty much entirely random i believe, or close enough to random that you cant tell. i remember seeing tango use tree saplings as a randomizer for clank detectors in decked out 2. apparently this works because an observer can detect every time a tree attempts to grow, even if it actually cant, and you can use this to get random redstone signals.

i think you had to build it a certain way to trick the saplings into thinking they can still grow without actually doing so. cant remember exactly, but i think you have to put something 2 blocks above it (or maybe a half slab?) and have a light source nearby."
1,Etho I am sorry to break this to you but you have goofed around in season 10 as well.
0,Loved the interaction with Jimmy and the other Hermits!
5,"Im pretty sure the base is joels, because the lever/end rod/chain design is all over his base"
0,I think it would be awesome to have time-lapse type videos of you working and planning you builds on the side like how you did in this video but more in depth and shows more of the building probably won't happen because of the amount of work put on top of everything else but I think it would awesome!
1,Joel's secret base is from Iskall's mission game.  I'm pretty sure it was one of those missions to build a secret base.

0,"Etho, just wanted to say I've been a fan of your stuff for most of my young-adult life. Some of the early Adventure Map series with Guude and Bdubs, the Mindcrack days and of course your Let's Play series have brought me so much joy throughout my life. The mix of playfulness paired with an actual mastery of the technical craftiness of this game is why I always come back to your videos. Keep doing your thing, many best wishes."

0,"massive props to Etho, he could've easily reached out to a prebuilt place and got the PC for free for a sponsorship. The fact that he didn't in today's world is shocking and speaks to the man character."
0,"For Rock Bottom, I wonder if a bucket of milk would work as a 1 time use water bucket clutch? I've never tried it, but it could be an interesting option that won't risk messing up the rest of the build by leaving water sources around."
8,"Etho, the tree bug happens because 2x2 trees dont like blocks next to them when they grow. The only exception is logs and leaves. (Even vines from jungle tress prevent growth). Importantly, other saplings also prevent tree growth. The exact dimensions of the sapling ""exclusion zone"" is a 3x3 square around the Northwest sapling. So once the northwest-most tree grows, suddenly all the trees to the southeast can now grow because the saplings that were preventing the growth are now replaced by logs and therefore are no longer preventing growth. Similarly, 2x2 trees that are planted in a line will grow in a similar manner: the north-most or the west-most tree will grow first, and then the trees will progress down the line. 

source: extensive Redstone tree farming and research. 

Mangrove trees grow in an even more interesting manner..."

0,"You should make Rock Bottom themed as an aquatic hadal-zone habitat, like Rock Bottom from _SpongeBob._"
0,friendly reminder to update the computer specs in your channel's description once you set up the new computer
0,"For spruce saplings, you would want to place 4 and bonemeal 1 of them only. If you have 16 in a close area, the game tries to figure out which one you are trying to grow it might be a bug. But if you place 4 at a time it would save you a bunch of bonemeal."
0,You can also try out using Linux instead of Windows 11.
2,"Hey Etho big warning/tip for windows 11, i just got my first decent gaming rig and was stuck in a setup loop due to a known issue intalling the latest update of windows 11 and had to skip the update from a command window to even use my PC.

Bought an M.2 drive soon after and it was the absolute cherry on top of the upgrade cake, our modded ARK: Survival Evolved server often required me to spend 12-ish minutes to load and now I can get on in less than 2. Still sitting on Windows 10 and really dreading the update to Win11, had to help a few ppl with various things on that OS and it was a really painful experience, many features are hidden in just straight up dumb places."

0,For some reason it seems weird to get a computer update in a Hermitcraft episode!
0,"hi etho, the bonebeal bug on your tree farm is something i’ve experienced too. i find that if you try and change which sapling you’re trying to bonemeal every so often, it makes it easier for the tree to realise that it’s ready to grow. i think there is actually a specific sapling that you can bonemeal and it will just grow like normal, i think it might be influenced by directionality or something.

i’d love to know what indie games you’re playing! i’ve been super addicted to balatro recently."

0,"Etho, if you're bothered by Windows, perhaps consider keeping your old computer so you can experiment with Linux distros without interrupting your workflow on your main computer? I won't tell you there isn't going to be a learning curve with using a different OS and finding FOSS software alternatives for your daily activities, hence I suggest to experiment first. But Minecraft java runs great on Linux, and between Steam and Lutris most games in general are working pretty good these days. Took me a while to figure it all out, but I haven't had any reasons to go back to Windows since I finally migrated. Feels good to not worry about my own operating system spying on me, or updating whenever it pleases."

0,"18:00 You know you can have the crafter dispenser the TBR minecarts directly onto the rails instead of the dispenser.... then have a comparator reading the crafter's fullness level to turn off the RS torch powering the rails. 

For anyone who needs further explanation: 

Crafters can dispense minecarts onto rails (noted above), then the comparator reading the comparator, contrasting against something completely full (lectern with a book turned to it's last page / another crafter with all slots blacked out, etc) when there's anything in the crafter (so it's 100% full) it outputs a signal to turn off the redstone torch (have the comparator pointing into the block this torch is on, directly or via rs dust). Once the crafter runs out of whatever material it's given (tnt and a minecart) the comparator turns off turning the torch back on."

Really cool Kelp farm! The speed is super impressive.

I wanted to show you something that you've been a huge inspiration for! I've been working on a build inspired by Tango and your postal system this season! It's a lot faster and has some other cool uses. It would mean a lot if you could take a look at the video I did :)

Love your videos, keep up the good work :)"
0,Hey Etho! What indies have you been playing lately?
0,Now @Etho has to update his computer specs on his profile description. Cant wait to see that happen next year lol 🎉❤ 🤣🤣🤣🎉🎉🎉
1,"Hey Etho, nice to have another Hermitcraft episode out. I always look forward to these and my 45 minutes of not having to worry about life.

I recently got myself a new pc aswell and wanted to get a really decent one just so i dont have to worry for the next couple years.
I'm the same when it comes to prebuild but i like choosing my own components.
So i build a custom PC on a PC building website thats local to my country and got a setup thats lets me play any game i own on high settings with well over 100FPS for 2,6k Euros.
Still expensive but i got a 4070 TI Super, 32GB DDR5 and a 12 core AMD CPU aswell as the fasted commercial SSDs and M.2s i could get.


Since i work in IT i can also deduct it from taxes which helps alot and i think you can probably do that aswell.
Have an awesome week!"

0,Still suprised that Etho doesn't use Linux 😮
0,"Going for 14th intel series was a bad decision, they have so many issues and die after a short while. Intel has lost it's way, it's no coincidence they let go 20% of their staff now. Should've gone with AMD, AM4 socket and a 5700x3d or something."
0,care to name the model of the computer you bought?
0,"No, your right with the trees. I don't bother with bonemealing, it will grow when it grows and I go do something else. Also the minecart facing east and west is really funny."

0,i hope you don't have as many issues with the intel processor as skizz did. intel is having issues this generation...
0,"There are definitely benefits to prebuilt computers. I built a computer a few years ago, and it has always had this issue where it randomly freezes/crashes. It only happens about 1-2 times per week, which makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot. If it was prebuilt I would simply return the computer, but since I don't know which component is faulty, I'm stuck with it."

Just wanted to drop a mention so Etho is aware and can ask them :) .... also, I used to buy prebuilts but transitioned to building my own instead so I could upgrade individual parts instead of full systems. But I fully understand people that just want to buy a thing and skip all the hassle, lol!"

Hey eho, I use your tree farm in my survival world and i find that only bone-mealing certain saplings will cause the trees to grow. if you place a 2x2 of saplings, bone meal it, then repeat 4 times (instead of doing all the saplings then all the bone-mealing) you shouldn't run into this problem."

0,Dispenser clicking is why I do most of my redstone with volume muted
0,"never really knew how much worked you put in your current hermitcraft builds. if this was me id just find building a contraption twice (one on creative and one actual) too much of a hassle and just wing it one go. no wonder you barely finished builds on the server 😂 Part of what I love about you is your builds are always functional, there are always some cool unique mechanisms on your builds. even if your builds arent as many or as massive as bdubs', they will still be one of the top attractions on the server cuz of its functionality. 
Conceptualizing the build, learning the science behind it (like when you built the river next to your house, how the curvature are made), building it on creative, gathering the materials on the server, rebuilding it on the server hoping it works."
0,"@15:45 Not cub. Joel. Cause he's so obsessed with you, and no other reason."
0,Hey Etho! I was wondering if youd ever think about making a second channel that has the uncut versions of your videos! Like how youll sometimes have your building segments or resource gathering/farm making segments that you cut into and out of. I think some of us would definitely watch those longer format videos just to see what youve done!

0,"The tree issue is caused by a weird behavior with the 2x2 spruce saplings. The logic for detecting if they are blocked is really strict so almost any block adjacent to them is enough to block growth, even torches, tall grass, or other spruce saplings, but only in certain directions. So some of the trees are blocked by the other saplings and will never grow, but once the one unblocked tree grows, the ones it was blocking can grow freely since logs and leaves do not block growth. If you pay attention you'll notice that one tree always grows first and as long as you bonemeal them in order you shouldn't have any issues."
0,"Plz do a mini episodes of just redstone builds start to finish. You explain the game well, and you're redstone is awesome."
0,"I agree with you, Etho. They need to make the clicking sound softer."
0,I also think using that pig to catch a saddle will be cool.
0,Hey @ethoslab you’ve used hay bales to negate falls in that horse racing game you made I think. I just noticed you didn’t include it with the fall damage negating items. I think a piston works to negate fall damage as well somehow.

You do have to do your homework for sure, read reviews, decide where to splurge and where to skimp on the build."

1,"etho for rock bottom what if you have a llama or a horse that keeps moving in an erractic way for a chance the person just skip the entire course to guess and find where the llama is and saddle clutch


edit: congrats on the new pc etho!!!"
0,"The 2x2 tree-growing bug may not be a bug I think. I believe it is directional. The 4 tree formation that you use, has the trees adjacent/touching each other. When I used to play Minecraft, I used the same formation to grow trees compactly as well. I noticed, there's always 2 trees that grows with ease and 2 that never grows until the adjacent growable one grew. 

My bet is, when you bonemeal a sapling, it scans adjacent 3x3 blocks to determine the 2x2 sapling group it is in. And based on the direction(north/east/whichever it starts scanning from), it may find a sapling that is intended to be part of another tree. But when it checks for 2x2 formation encompassing both the original and the newly found sapling, it finds incomplete formation thus the tree growing fails.

Another possibility is touching blocks preventing mega-tree growing. I remember grass stops growing, same tree sapling prevents growth from 2 directions but not the other two. Logs never prevents, thus when the growable ones grow, the other 2 can also grow.

I don't have Minecraft on my new PC, I can't test/experiment. The insight is from memory."
0,"You mentioned issues with bonemealing saplings. I’ve got a tree farm modeled after yours, and there’s a very specific order I have to bonemeal the trees for them to grow quickly."
0,Tissue box upgrade inbound?
0,36:35 exactly!
0,"Etho, I am currently catching up on your let's play and I'm finally at 530 something now. Enjoying watching your progress and you talking about your PC is making me wish I had the money for one. I started my own youtube thanks to you and trying to do the same thing in my own way. You inspired me since I was 10-11 years old. I'm now 23 and have my own kid watching you with me. I really enjoy your content."
0,14 episodes in a year?
1,there used to be a restaurant in my city named rock bottom; that had the best pizza and hearing you say that name os many times is making me crave their food so bad lmao (alas i cant have it as they never reopened after pandemic)
7,"Redstone, Building, Combat, Survival. Long ago, the Minecraft fandom lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Combat Nation attacked. Only Ethoslab, master of all four playstyles, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. One month passed and you and I discovered a new Ethoslab video, a Hermitcraft episode named Hermitcraft S10#14: Rock Bottom. And although his videos are great, more people need to learn about him to find his top quality content. But I believe Etho can save the Fandom."
0,"That new computer sounds NICE!! Congrats on getting a good deal, Etho!"
0,So etho gets a $1600 pc but is there an actual microphone stand or stick with the tissue box?
1,congrats on the new computer man!
1,So real for just getting a computer now before they gwt way more expensive 😢😅
0,Thoroughly enjoyed the episode!!!! Thank you!!!

1,"16:14 the secret room is from iskall85's challenge game thing. Joel rolled the challenge to create a secret bedroom containing a bed, bamboo in a pot and end rods as light source I believe"
1,"I also upgraded my PC recently. Did it now because of the economy as well, but ive been thinking about it for months. My PC was 7-8 years old and while it worked good, it was starting to show its age. Since I wanted this to be my PC for a while, at least another 7 years, maybe even 10, I splurged a bit. Went from a GTX 1080 to a Raden 9700 XTX and an i5-8400 to a Ryzen 9 7950X."
1,Thanks for taking the time to go through how you plan out your builds in hermitcraft!!! That was a ton of fun to watch :D !
0,Please do a create playthrough!

8,"Etho is hermitcraft at its purest <3 his voice is like a breath of fresh air. He has *such* a calming presence. He seems like such a sweet person, his outros, everything. That “Take care everyone” seems so genuine <3"
1,I love how you make different kinds of bombs. You've developed so many methods of clearing land. I can't wait to see how else Etho will continue to blow up Minecraft blocks
0,I thought his shop would be a giant stone butt...
0,I MISSED YOU ETHO!!❤️ I hope you are doing amazing!
0,"The amount of times Etho has called himself or something he’s made stupid in the first 10 minutes of this episode: too many times xD

0,"Etho: I never done trident pvp

Also etho: made trident pvp before"
0,36:16 finally he's moving one to Dance Dance Revolution 5
3,etho upgrading his computer before his keyboard is just etho lore lol
0,Fully agreed on the bit about pre built PCs. It's just so much less headache (especially the software setup). It also used to be far more not worth the price to buy pre builts but now there is a lot of competition in that market so you really aren't spending THAT much more for a pre built these days.
0,Etho! you are the best
0,"I recently upgraded my amd RX580 to a 6800XT, and went from a 1080p monitor to 4K. It is amazing, and i love hearing when people upgrade because the difference is so significant. I hope it works well for you! I am keeping my eye out for tools to declutter Window 11. Its not awful, but there's definitely a lot of bloat."
5,"Guys, it's been so long since Etho posted hermitcraft. I've had to search other hermits videos just to find out what he is up to. Then I found hermitcraft recap and it made things a lot easier. But still, my Etho fix is hard to satiate. Glad we are finally getting another episode."
0,I'm a little surprised Etho doesn't build his own or at least upgrade his own PC. I built my pc back in 2010 or something and only upgraded it since then never replaced the whole thing it's the ship of thesis that started out with a phenom ii x4 980 CPU went to i5 6600k now rocks i5 12600k etc. Guess he's just not a real computer enthusiast just a Minecrafter.
1,An average of 1 episode a month after a year is not what I was hoping for after being spoiled from last season
31,"For rock bottom, you could do something like pressing a hidden button that after a delay causes a dispenser to create a water source for a brief moment, so they have to find the button, then notice the water to see what it does, and then time it correctly to use the shortcut."
0,"Ethoooooo...

When are you going to do Vintage Story?"
1,I'm shocked that Etho's old computer was _only_ 4 years old considering the stories of his other equipment lol
1,"Etho working on 16 GB of RAM into 2025... Honestly, massive respect"
56,37:32 don't worry Windows 11 is worse then 10... 😓
1,"Hey Etho, I found it super interesting seeing how you experiment and change ideas from creative to survival for HC. Would you ever consider touring your HC creative world(s?) for a season after it is over?"
1,What about linux for the new pc? I feel like etho may be a (potential) linux enjoyer?
0,"2x2 trees need 'clear' blocks of space to their north and their west to grow.  Saplings don't count as clear space but logs do, which is why the other trees can only grow once the northwest tree has grown.  It's weird."
0,"Omg, this comments.... Is ""get a life"" to much?"
0,I'm so sorry Etho but entering the new tree farm room just makes it look like a purple minion
1,This thumbnail threw me. I thought YT was throwing an old video at me and had to read the title 3 times to be sure.
4,Just a warning about that wind charge shop - you're supplying the others with the equipment needed to flip all your trapdoors.
1,personally i love watching the redstone builds from the ground up. It would be sweet to see more of those as stand alone videos since it seems like some people have an aversion to it.
0,I wonder if Etho also got a new mic stand with that new PC
0,jimmy saying score sounds like a redneck saying skull thank you
0,The tree thing is because you are randomly ageing the saplings. You probably need to spread out the bonemeal a bit on all 4 saplings in the megatree
0,Nice video etho
0,"My very _very_ first Minecraft build in my first Minecraft world (back in early 2013) was an attempt at an underground tree farm that could grow large spruce and jungle trees, inspired by the LP world tree farm. I got impatient digging the holes (in creative mode too lol) so they just ended up being deep pits that opened to the sky with no decoration and some tunnels to connect. But still... kinda funny to see all these years later an actual underground tree farm for tall trees from the man himself."

0,Omg your computer story is almost exactly what I did to a T a couple months ago haha. Except that I still did go for building my own and took some pre-owned deals to get the price down.
0,I think Etho is the only man ever to use smooth stone and _froglights_ as building blocks for doing redstone
0,"I stick to the $1800-2200 CAD range for my computers, built my current one in 2014/15 and it has 32GB of RAM (DDR3). Mine hasn't been able to run new AAA games for about 2-3 years now, but I target an 8-year extended lifespan for a high-end machine. (Or four years for an optimal lifespan, sounds like that's what you're on.) One day I'll upgrade, but I haven't seen any AAA games to be excited for yet. I know Creeper World IXE was pushing the CPU's limits though, so an upgrade is in the pipeline. But I'm still hitting the min spec for Windward Horizon though, so maybe later this year or next."
0,here we are
0,"only etho would upload a video on hermitcraft on the latest version and not show off a SINGLE thing about it, as if Everybody watches his let's play (which they should) so he doesn't even need to mention it"

1,Don't worry too much Etho! You have now made more episodes this season than last season when you exclude decked out! Good progress.
0,always maintain that questioning attitude!!
0,"Hey etho, (ergo?) I know slither channels doing somthing similar, you mention not knowing if we would like builds, would it be possible to get an ethos extras channel or somthing? Where you record your building process! Wouldn’t even have to have commentary I would definitely watch you just figure out a build on a 2 hr video either some light music on the background!"
0,Etho u should try streaming again I think you would like it!
0,Some of the best games I've played were not AAA games or have the fanciest graphics. They just had great game play and little to no story.
0,Haven’t finished the episode but u could put a light inside the kelp area to see through the window more clearly

407,"16:24 Joel built the base as one of the Mission Possible challenges. 

Something along the lines of ""Build a secret base in another hermit's base. It must include a bed, a crafting table and a plant"""
0,"Just as a joke, you should put the sign with the actual price down at bedrock, then charge an obscene amount.  That way, technically, you have ""rock bottom prices""."
0,"It seems to me like Etho and Zed are on a similar but very different mindset this season. Zed is wanting to gamify the entire survival aspect of Hermitcraft (farm building/resource collection). Meanwhile, Etho is wanting to gamify the whole co-op aspect of Hermitcraft (shopping district/exchange)."
0,"Really glad you got the 40 series and not 50s.  For your use case, the 50s would add nothing.  Good for dlss, etc.

Rock Bottom...Awesome!!!"
0,great video!
0,"Would be really cool if in Rock Bottom you could get upgrades along the path down. A few seconds of slow falling, feather falling boots with only a few durability, an item of food. Might be too complicated but could add extra risk vs reward for extra jumps on the way down!"

0,So... A dropper map?
268,"I was having a rough day till I saw there was an Etho video! I got my snacks!

Since I've started watching Etho, I have:

Finished middle school.
Finished high school.
Bought my first car.
Got married.
Started a business.
Sold my first car.
Got divorced.
Shuffled through random entry level jobs.
Closed my business.
Landed a robotics job because I wrote scripts to cheat at Minecraft.
Met the girl of my dreams.
Learned Spanish.
Got engaged.

I'm on my way to be a systems engineer..

And now I'm here, watching this Etho video. Weird."
0,"I personally enjoy seeing the redstone side of things to understand what's going on, especially as someone who really loves redstone. But I think it may drag out for some people that don't care too too much, so maybe a mix is good? You've actually done that a lot and I think that was a good way to do it, that you explain the basic idea behind it and build a fraction of it (e.g. just 1 part if that part needs to be repeated), then you finish it and then you show off what things got added to use it, like a dropoff area or so."
0,I don't think there is any content you can make that people won't watch
0,So… What indie games have you been playing Etho?
0,"Etho, maybe line the tunnel to your tree farm with wood? I think the colour combo would be superb!"

0,Better have a SpongeBob reference in rock bottom
0,I use to watch ethos everyday after school from 2011-2015; now 25 and I still watch ethos after work :) Love ya vids! Always a good day when etho uploads
0,Etho building 0-tick farms was not on my bingo card for this year
2,"“So I thought, ‘already using zero-ticking, might as well make it as fast as I can.” 😂😂 and i’m over here, like, “yup, another couple hours on a new farm.” 😂😂 Loved the look into the process, nuts-and-bolts stuff can be boring but this was a lot of fun! (& That Bonemeal Tree bug!!!!!????? Thank you for mentioning it)"
2,"wake up babe, new etho vid dropped."
0,"So happy that you finally gave yourself a computer upgrade! I was wondering if your YouTube bio was out of date, but every time you hit F3 I knew it was still accurate. I HIGHLY recommend buying an SSD for editing if your new computer does not already have a decent size one. The amount of editing you have done on that single hard drive for years baffles me! Great video and good luck!"
0,I still remember you talking about getting a new computer from Future Shop. Always happy to hear about your infrequent and modest upgrades.
0,"For one of the drop challenges, make it so that if the player clutches by pressing a button on the way down it will dispense water for 4 ticks.
Another idea would be allowing them to catch themselves in (enter) a boat / minecart mid fall to prevent fall damage."
0,"Thank you to be with us, you are amazing"
0,Its so reassuring that Etho also bought a new beastly computer before the tariffs. I went from an i5-something and a 2070 to an AMD 7800x3D and 5070 last week.
5,No format is best format. Loved the episode! It was great getting to see Etho’s “sketchbook” creative world. Great stuff.
0,"I'm glad you decided to bring back the whole tree farm build from season 9! it's one of my favourites of yours, and i do agree that we didn't have enough time to appreciate it :D"
0,36:20 yeah... but do you still have your computer set up on a bookshelf with a microphane held together with sticky tape and a mouse in front of the keyboard instead of beside it...? 😁
0,14:45 that might be one of cub's secret bases? he put a bunch around the server back in the day

2,An Etho video on my birthday! What a treat! Xx
0,"Terrafirmacraft is still around, it is a bit more advanced than on your last playthrough, I'd love to see you play it again, or alternatively Vintage Story which basically is terrafirmacraft as a standalone game, ive just started playing and i really enjoy surviving in it and how it's restrictiveness influences play style"
0,Congratulations on your new computer!
1,Perhaps update your computer specs in your YouTube about page 👀
0,But did you keep the tissue box?
2,Thanks for another wonderful video Etho!  (also the Jimmy death notification montage @ 31:06 😂)
5,Guys will be like “I needed this” and it’s just an Etho video.
0,"So thrilled to see the season 9 decor making a return for the tree farm!! I loved those colors and patterns so much, and they fit well with your current base too in my opinion :D

0,"11:25 If anything, exploring the what-if questions in the videos might be interesting as well (even if it’s just shorter, less-edited videos on the side separate from the main uploads)"
2,"I like how you showed us your planning process in the creative worlds, it was neat to see some of what goes on behind the scenes. Also that copper harvester machine was cool, I think adding machines like that to your base would give it a lot more character, even if the machines aren't super practical"
0,😊😊
0,"Hello Etho, big fan. I know this comment is presumptuous, but since you talked about your computer upgrade and you ended up going with an intel 14th generation chip, I hope you are aware of the potential issue plaguing that particular generation as well as the 13th. Supposedly those issues have been addressed in a microcode update, but if your new computer starts having issues, that would be the first place to check."
0,you are amazing
0,"I feel like Etho has at least 50 episodes worth of unreleased footage because every hermitcraft video from other videos, or like streaming from scar or whoever, etho is just in the chat talking trash. Etho just.. plays minecraft and hangs out on hermitcraft and when the content comes it comes"
0,"If you're upset with Windows 10, I doubt Windows 11 will be much better. I recently switched to Linux Mint and its been very similar to what I expect from Windows. Yes there's a few oddities, but Minecraft and Steam games run perfectly fine. Most of the issues I've run into were fixable within an hour or so, and were for games that insisted upon using their own launchers, like Blizzard, Ubisoft, or Epic games.

I don't know anything about recording software though."
0,ooohhhh Etho.... I think Impulse has a similar game almost finished already....
0,"New PC, cool. The real question is, did you get a new tissue box?"
0,Audio changes? Mans went to Costco and got a new microphone box. Maybe this time it’s a hot dog box.

0,Please reconsider your pc choice. If you look around you can find better systems at around the same price. The 4060 won't take you much further in Da Vinci Resolve because it only has 8 GB of video memory compared to your 2060's 6GB. Grab at least a 4060 Ti 16GB or 4070 12GB for ~1700 CAD - On Newegg there is a 14400F/RTX 4070/32GB RAM/1TB SSD ABS (Newegg brand) pc right now.

55,"Big LP vibes from this episode, thanks for mixing some bits of info about the server in this one too, I really appreciate it. The small timelapses are better than abrupt cuts, although at this point I feel like the latter fits more your style of videos.

Etho's old and new computer, for anyone wondering:

i7 9700          -> Intel i7 14700
16 GB DDR4 -> 32 GB DDR5 (idk how fast, probably 5600 MT/s)
RTX 2060      -> RTX 4060
Windows 10 -> Windows 11

Thought for sure that you would go full AMD this time, considering how compelling Ryzen CPUs and, more recently, the RX 9070 XT have been, compared to Intel and Nvidia's stuff. Well, staying with what works best for you is probably the safest way to go. Just make sure to keep an eye on that CPU because 13th and 14th gen Intel CPUs had issues with both oxidation and the microcode literally frying them, and also because they chug a lot of power (and therefore, need good cooling installed).

Will we get to see a picture of it? lol"

0,"I think the tree growing problem has to do with which sapling gets the bonemeal in the 2x2. I think the game kind of ignores some of the saplings, or can't calculate the correct patch of 2x2 for some reason."
0,"Hi Etho, I really enjoyed this episode! Hope you're doing well. I'd be interested in seeing more of the ideas you cut from the episode if you have any examples of builds or creative experiments that didn't make it. I know you've said in the past that some of your noteblock stuff you can't show but I really enjoy listening to the little jingles you make and how you approach it too! Thank you for the episode and take care! ❤"

0,"22:40 I have noticed that trees dont grow if you bonemeal one face constantly, if you want them to grow faster you need to bonemeal multiple faces of the sapling or, in 2x2s bonemeal different sapplings"

You should've watched your compatriot Linus Sebastian from LTT before making those choices.

60,"@11:00 That's one of the reasons we like you, Etho. You aren't afraid to experiment and make mistakes and start over and inevitably come up with something better."
3,"Hey Etho -- Isn't your tree farm affected by the Northwest rule? for a 2x2 tree to grow it needs to have a 3x3 area free *outside of the saplings forming the 2x2* -- and its centered on the NW sapling. For this check Wood blocks don't count but other saplings do.. so your tree farm setup is biased as a result, you need to grow the northmost and/or westmost tree first & it should ""unlock"" the next ones. (N W S E or W N E S depending on which way you go)"

1,this whole video is Etho vs Directionality lol
0,I literally looked at your channel 'about me' this morning (was thinking I hadn't seen a new video in a while) and was surprised you were only rocking 16gb of RAM and a 2060. Funny to me you talk about your new upgrade right after
0,Lovely to see a Hermitcraft video again!
0,Any chance you can record in 1440p? :O

1,But did you get a mic stand!
0,1:34 February 18 is my birthday!
0,"The real question is... when you bought the new computer, did you get a new tissue box for your microphone?"
3,"Look at the bright side, Etho. It's been a year but you at least got the roof done!





And a full on ravager redstone minigame. So you've done a lot."
0,make sure you update your bios otherwise the 14700k is going to die
0,"Congrats on the new computer!  Sounds like a fantastic deal.

My desktop is from about 2012…I’m also considering getting a new one.  Need it if I want to play the games I’m thinking about getting.  I miss being anywhere near a Memory Express."

0,"Have you tried souls games? I started with Demon's Souls on a PS3 emulator.

I think you should try to interact with us commenters abit more, i dont see any interactions made whatsoever and yeah i know you get like thousands of comments and such but it only takes a few moments to spend some time with us as your viewers. You could go down the comments and slap some hearts on the ones you like. Have a nice day. Ive been watching for 13 years."
0,Instead of fixing your farm you could’ve just rotated your entire base 90 degrees!🔥
0,Guess I don't need to sleep
1,"Wow I had to double take and check the title again. What a blast from the past that build! 
Also, I don't blame Etho for slacking because Ravager Rush was a passion project and it seems like he's getting by just fine without a tree farm but its still important to have. Lastly, I feel this 11:02 so much when detailing my builds! Mainly since I don't have a reference and so many blocks to choose from. It's like a going down a rabbit hole with no escape rope and then I feel like I wasted so much time but I'm always happy with the result."
0,imagine Etho with a modern gaming setup....
0,"Regarding the new computer: Make sure you install all the bios and mainboard firmware uptdates!!! Intel 14 series has issues with parts failing due to improper voltage settings and low quality silicon. There were some updates that are supposed to prevent that, but you never know how long the PC has been sitting on the shelf. Cheers!
Also: Check out Fedora Linux KDE. It looks a lot like Windows and just works. No ads, no bloat, no random backgound services spying or pushing ai."

0,ETHO WE MISSED YOU!!
0,"etho i do know what happens with the trees and why they dont grow. i know it because i do have a similar tree farm in my world and i had the same problem, but it has to do with what tree you grow first. take note on the one the order you have grow them here, because that is the order you have to do it if you want to do it using less bonemeal. 

please trust me on this, take note on the order they have grown here and bonemeal them in that order, im certain that they will grow like normal trees in the world do"
0,A new Etho rig??? insanity
0,so the question to ask when you get a new PC is 'does it run minecraft'
1,"The struggle with choosing PC parts is real. Especially GPUs which are horribly overpriced here in Europe as well. My 2080 is struggling, but I refuse to let myself get fleeced, so probably gonna stick to smaller indie games and older games until the market gets better.

0,"Hey there Etho, congrats on the new PC! About your Windows 11 comment, have you ever considered switching to Linux? It's in a really good place right now. My gaming PC runs Bazzite (which has embedded Nvidia drivers) and it has run all games I want without issues (except Cities Skylines II but that runs like crap regardless of OS). Besides, you are quite a technical guy, so I suspect that playing around with your system might also be very fun for you, which Windows just doesn't allow.

If you are interested and are looking for pointers, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Bazzite are good places to start. The former have great documentation and expansive support forums, whereas the latter has all that (it's based on Fedora) plus a lot of stability and quality of life additions."
0,"feel like the dispenser clicking being an annoying sound is intentional, since if the redstone is running efficiently it won't make any sound at all"
0,"Etho, dude, even tho it is nice to see you upload the video, which me, and the rest of your subscribers are happy about, it would be nice to see you uploading more often. Once a month or less is really rare. you just give us a video and then dissapear out of existence out for a month or more. Dude, come on. No exdplanation or anything. Please, be more consistance with uploads. Even if you dont dont much in a episode, thats fine, not a problem, just upload more, for the love of god :)"

0,New computer huh? Crazy kitchen sink modded Minecraft when?
1,"For the tree growing thing, I've always assumed all the saplings in a 2x2 tree need to be at age 1 for the 2x2 tree to grow. I don't know if that's actually true, but I think I usually spend less bonemeal growing trees than you did in the segment around 22:00. Maybe something to check?"

6,"ETHO! Avoid the intel 13th and 14th gen processors. They are slowly destroying themselves. I got the 13900k used off ebay figuring ""how often are processors the part that goes bad"". I've been getting more and more errors and I've had to undervolt it more and more to keep every game from crashing. Eventually it will die for good. Now I don't even have a warranty to RMA it, though what I've heard is those who did RMA it even have issues with their replacements from the same generation. I know you'll be getting prebuilt and everything will be under warranty, but they will probably replace it with the same generation processor, which just resets the clock until you start getting errors again. Save yourself the headache and get intel 12th gen or go AMD."

2,"I'm so excited about the new rock bottom game! I really enjoy watching the game-making process, I like following the thought process through the basic concept, different gameplay elements, bug squishing, improving replayability and the competitiveness...

0,"When you bone meal 2x2 trees (or in larger areas of those saplings even like 2x4 or 4x4, 4x6 and so on), it's important you are bone mealing the North West most sapling, the other saplings will either not respond properly to being bone mealed or just on average take more bone meal for whatever reason. remember North West!"

0,"I’m with you on the bonemeal eating tree saplings. I don’t have evidence, but I always feel like something got stuck in processing the game, so I break the saplings and wait a few ticks to replace them, then they seem to grow - faster, if I don’t have bonemeal, or if I do, with a reasonable amount of bonemeal. It makes me crazy to be below my trees working for twenty minutes to a half hour and to go up and find them still saplings.

This was an interesting video. Thanks for sharing behind the scenes."

I think is because the 4 tree pattern we do, maybe the game doesn't recognize the 2x2 squares properly"
0,"call me noisy, but i am so cureius about the games etho plays off-camara. i am not suprised one bit that he is not a triple-A fan, but from what he shared in the past he really seems to be someone who gets hyper-fixated on one game for a few months and then moves on.

Thank you Mr Slab for the best coincidence I never knew would happen"
1,"My memory isn't the best but I think maybe that hidden Joel base was a Mission Possible thing I think the challenge for the hidden base required a bed, ender chest, and a bamboo to count as a base? 

I love the recreation of the Season 9 base for the Tree farm I loved that room last season it's nice to see it the pallette and the language are awesome 

The mini games mixed in with the shops are always fun especially ones like with rocks that might not make a lot of money out still gives a reason to visit it

On a side note that Tango stream with playing Hungry Hermits and find the farter with Jimmy was so much fun and I'm glad he was able to get the Frogger trophy, I hope one day he can become an official Hermit Jimmy is the best"

Out of curiosity Etho, you mentioned years ago that you'd tried Dwarf Fortress but was turned off by the graphics. Have you tried the new Steam version with a proper tileset? I also wonder if you'd like Baldurs Gate 3. A lot of the game is built around finding creative solutions to problems. The runtime is a bit threatening though."

1,"Hi Etho, about the tree's not growing and spending stacks upon stacks of bonemeal on them. I believe that is only happening if they don't have enough room to grow a bigger tree. The code is probably saying something like ""Lets grow. Choose random tree configuration to place. Does it fit? No? Then cancel tree growth"". 

Also there seems to be a ""best"" sapling to bonemeal of the 2x2 spruce tree's. I've forgotten which direction it is but it is always the same compass direction."

If crashing while rendering videos was a concern with your last, you should consider looking into the 14 gen cpus and their issues, and possibly (depending on if the issues have been fixed or not) return the pc you got. 

Even so, at 1600 Canadian, you got *fleeced.* Especially with a 14 gen intel in there. I am not entirely sure about pricing in Canada for computer parts, but that seems *very* high for the specs that you describe. Might be a regional thing, I don’t know.

All my best,
SNTACV"
1,"There's this one guy who plays Isaac multiplayer I keep running into, named ""Ethos"", and every time I play with them there's this little voice inside hoping it's actually you.
This little voice also screamed when I saw this episode's title. :)"
33,"22:40 I've found that growing a single 2x2 tree first, then placing the saplings for the next one works well. So the tree doesn't have to ""decide"" where to grow since there's only 1 valid spot."
0,Congrats on the new PC! Probably a good call to upgrade right now... By chance will we be getting a bump to 1440p?
0,18:18 The time bomb :D
0,"Ethos making up for ""slacking"" by speed running the Hermitcraft season this episode!"
0,just when I needed it most Etho appears thanks for the videos i love them all.
0,Etho have you purchased a new tissue box to go with the new PC? 😂
1,Helldivers 2 🫡
3,"I don't know if you've watched Blockwars (Joel and Cub played it a couple of times), but in their party game there's a minigame called Go Down which is very similar to rock bottom! Cool to see you converge on the same idea"
1,"Did you upgrade your tissue box too?

Could go for one of the flashier boxes with fancy decoration on it, kind of like the RGB setup equivalent of Kleenex boxes."
0,"30:55 wow etho, you really decided to not save that redstone from the explosions, bad"
0,I always think it's odd when redstoners show their work (the hidden redstone under the project) and it's just a dirt room but yet it's always so important to put the redstone itself on an identifying block. Why not at least throw up some concrete walls and give the behind the scenes redstone a proper room?
0,Not me thinking Jimmy had been properly invited to the server
1,ethoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,"Yes, we are interested in you building the farm ❤"
0,Did you upgrade the Kleenex box?
239,Etho just casually reinvented a longer version of a dropper map and thought we wouldn't notice (29:00)
9,"10:45 it's super tough for me to leave something knowing it could've been better— it's way easier to believe ""i did what i could"" when there's so much about that specific field that i don't know.
loved the video!! i'm so excited to see the season 9 tree farm again AND connect to a passage (that hopefully sees a lot of use!!) to the overworld"
0,Hermitcraft episode every 26 days! Haha love you etho id take one of yours over 100 from everyone else
0,"S10#14
What?
It's only been 14 episodes?
Damn, between the Let's Play and Wild Life series I never realised how few Hermit Craft videos Etho has released"
0,"Oh boy, you might end up switching back to windows 10. I've been on windows 11 for a while and I'm really thinking of going back..."
6,"I myself am also in the process of a comparable PC upgrade. My current PC is from 2019: Core i5-9600k, 32Gb DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 3070. For this upgrade, I too wanted to get a high-end PC for once. So over the past few months I've been collecting components: I scored an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D at MSRP before their stock went all rare and prices skyrocketed, getting 64Gb DDR5 RAM, and..... I'm waiting on a video card upgrade a bit more, mainly for financial reasons. But I _was_ mighty tempted by the RX 9070 XT!"
2,Do you have a new mic stand though? haha
0,"Hey Etho, ever play Heroes of Might and Magic 3? I just got into it, can't remember if I played it in the 90s when it came out, but it really holds up."
0,Finally an etho video!
0,Im powering threw being sick and an Etho vid is just what i needed
0,What a great jump on pc specs! I hope Etho's next video will be a deluxe tissue box for is micophone.
452,"in case anyone was wondering, joel built that base as a part of a mission from the mission possible game that was made early on in the season by someone who's not on the server any more"

10:00 wow that smoker setup is SO much better than my own design.... I never thought of making it an xp farm too! 💖
22:40 OH GOSH that bug annoys me so much too! Do you have a  tutorial for that tree farm tho? I've tried to build it and failed so amynt imes
Thanks so much for the episode! 💖💖💖"
950,"22:10 There seem to be a bug with the 2x2 tree growing algorithm. You always need to grow the north or west direction first! (depends on the rotation of the ""gear-/sawshaped"" dirt platform).
The other directions will never grow first, regardless of how much bonemeal you use :D"
12,I love the part where etho said it's tree growing time and the trees grew all over the place Absolute Cinema

0,you could try linux on your old computer once the new one arrives. have fun with the new one! :)

0,what indie games have u been enjoying recently?
48,"13:45 I like how the remaining kelp float up slowly, almost like a lava lamp 😊"
12,"I love seeing all the ""behind the scene"" things and decision making."
0,hi etho
2,i'd love to see more of the building process!! one of my favourite things about watching minecraft videos is that each person's approach is entirely unique to /them/. it's one thing to be wowed by a build but seeing someone's take on a problem and/or how they view a situation & working through it /with/ them is even better imo
0,I hope you have fun with your new pc! And you can always switch to Linux when windows 11 becomes too much :P
0,"I love episodes when we get to see the creative test worlds, always makes me want to go play for myself!
& that new computer is going to help a ton! The 4060 will be plenty for indie games at 1080p, but could've probably gone a bit higher spec for video editing. Either way, 16gb to 32gb of ram will help a ton! Maybe you could treat yourself to a new tissue box too while you're at it!"
0,"Sooo… Etho got a new, off-the-shelf computer for $1600 Canadian (under $1200 USD). That’s… that’s a glorified gaming laptop. Etho has been making videos for years with a glorified gaming laptop. What a fkn legend 😂"

0,i knew i felt something different in the air today.. an etho post was coming
1,"Etho, would you consider doing a playthrough of another game such as Undertale or Deltarune at any point? I think it would be fun to see"
326,"Rock Bottom could be so fun with a random seed. Pistons retracted or not with the push of a button to create or blocks paths, removing water, etc. making each run a bit different. Obviously the best time would then be a bit luck-based, but more replayability."
11,"Gathering sand so doc can fill up his hourglass, that’s so darn wholesome etho 😊"

8,"I know this is asking a lot as someone who's been watching since the 480p days, but any chance you could start uploading in 1440p with the new PC? YouTube's *really* downgraded the 1080p bitrate recently, and 1440p helps a lot to reduce the compression artifacts/macroblocking."

0,"congrats on the new computer! i'm building my first right now and boy howdy do i agree with it being a hassle 😅 i think i'll pay someone to do it for me in the future. hopefully your new setup makes things faster and easier for you!

i was so excited seeing that season 9 tree farm come back to life! i'm a big fan - people so rarely use purple in their builds, in large part because there's very few good purple blocks, so i've loved that build ever since you first made it. happy it will get some new use!

""timebomb"" is such a cool name for that absolutely terrifying contraption btw."

0,"The video compression looks off in this episode. Installed Resolve/Windows updates recently?

edit: finished the episode. Has to be the fresh install. I would double-check the export/rendering settings in resolve. To me it looks like this episode was exported with a really low bitrate preset. Any time there is movement, the picture gets really mushy"

Will you make a second channel where you place videos like for example: playing repo with friends. (Like grian on two much grian). Or think other side things, whatever you want, but don't want to affect the main channel.

127,"2:00 I do quite like seeing the process of tiny redstone farms because they’re small doable things that I can build in my world, not massive mega redstone stuff, and as someone who doesn’t really get redstone it means that I’m not just copying the final product, but I’m almost ‘part’ of the creation process"
2,New Etho Hermitcraft video right now and he is playing Among Us 3D right now with Jimmy and the Hermits so I'm actually watching that right now and will be back for the video later but can't wait

0,"I haven't got to your more recent episodes, so I'm not sure if you changed it or not, but I think you should keep the desert well, but nudge it a bit to the right (from the angle at 11:30.) That way, It's still there as a reminder from the early days of your world, but it's centred with everything you've built around it in the years since."
1,Please make me feel well and leave the well
0,"Hey Etho, any plans to play other similar games? Oddspark is really cool and I think it feets you genra"
0,I like the mismatched nature of your world. its a kitchen sink of game updates and memories.
0,"The recent updates really add to the game, minecraft has come a long way"
0,"Hey Etho! Huge fan, thanks for making great content. Just wanted to say in regard to the desert well- something that has worked for me in the past when it comes to the ""beautify the world"" vs. ""preserve the history"" argument is to just terriform around bad or awkward small builds with a hill or whatever else might match the terrain. Its a lot of work sometimes, but you get to both keep the little piece of history alive and clean up the world a bit. Hope this was helpful :)"
0,"Too busy, looks a mess to me... Anton Petrov. really good Tuber' that reviews new scientific papers... He the ""Wonderful Person"" guy."
0,"11:10 back in 2013 when i was in my first year of high school i remember being in class and exploring your world download even though i was supposed to be doing work, but everyone secretly did other stuff on our laptops if we could get away w it. i pressed this button and ended up dying which felt super embarrassing because i was hyperaware i on off had the attention of people around me. everytime you go past the well i get reminded of this hahaha. i think you should keep as much old stuff as possible. i see minecraft worlds as works of art/diary entries/stories of ones life. i've had the same world since age 20 and will be 26 in 2 weeks. i lost pretty much all of my old ones. hang on to the memories. that's my 2 cents :))"
0,"bro i’ve been coming back for over a decade, please, don’t think you have to do this content optimization stuff. have some integrity"
0,thats my emotional support desert well trap
0,11:25 I remeber dying to that well years ago!!! Aw man i gott go run around your would again for some inspiration!! We love you Etho ❤
0,"I like the idea of bringing in the old structure through terraforming, keeping the old is most important but it's nice to reconcile with what you're feeling now. Also fine with me if you want to change things, I don't want the world to become a pure nostalgia-fest for you or for us, change is part of that.
Idea: Could put some regular sand on the new mesa-fied land, try and make it look like the last bit of an old biome that is being desertified? You've already kind of been doing that with the way you deal with the harsh break between desert and grass with the path and mini-wall. Adds a sense of not just borders, but an active ecological process going on in the background that you've participated in combating somehow."
0,Yay etho watches veritasium 😄
0,thoughts on wireless redstone?
0,I'm so amazed that Etho's let's play world is still going! I absolutely love polishing work and it's a great update to do it in!

0,I'm sorry but leaf litter looks like p o o p
0,"Hey Etho in your recent hermitcraft video you talked about how you're not big on playing AAA games and tend to play indies. What sort of games would you recommend as I've been playing a lot of indies recently like outer wilds, tunic, deaths door, and in stars and time. Also have you played any of those games and if so what did you think of them?"

2,"Hey Ergo, long time fan. Have you considered recording more of the ""boring"" stuff? It could be an easy way to make more episodes. That kind of low effort thing you've talked about before. Also, I used to find your building, randomness, and redstone very entertaining and informative. Cant wait to see more! Take care, byebye"
1,awaiting your return my liege
1,"I would argue against removing old landmarks like the lava well. Your 591 episode run so far spans across most stages of Minecraft and it's amazing that we can keep experiencing it in each of your videos. It's nice to freshen up the area around the place, but removing it like it never existed would feel a bit sad to me"
0,Post more videos golly
1,Hey Etho. Longtime fan. I hope you know just how much we appreciate your videos :)
1,I love how Ethos world has so much history to it even though it's a bit higglety pigglety. It's Minecraft history and should be seen as such.
1,Etho plz post
1,Etho Mr Beast Mentioned you in his build off competition on his gaming channel
1,Bros a legend at this point
0,"Hi Etho! For many people, we bought the game 10+ years ago and since then we’ve had near constant free updates to the game. For instance, I bought the game one time in 2011 for $20 and have never spent another dollar on it. I assume Microsoft funds this business model through merch, Bedrock micro-transactions, etc. 

Do you think there’s a future where this business model is no longer sustainable and Microsoft chooses to charge subscriptions for Minecraft or brings in micro-transactions to Java? If hypothetically Minecraft needed a subscription, would you keep playing?"
0,Post more if you care about your fans
1,"Etho, as a big fan of your channel and your super smelter, I have to let you know that when you were building it you set a delay mechanism so the hopper minecarts go when they receive 8 items - you had 64 furnaces at the time. After you expanded to 128 furnaces, you never updated the timing mechanism, so it’s not fully optimized. Thought I would comment that even though it’s totally off topic for this video."
2,And hes gone again
0,Woooooah
0,Mr beast mentioned etho in his video 😊
0,I think the last time I watched one of Etho's videos was in 2012. For some reason the other day I had a thought of 'I wonder what he is up to these days' and am happy to see that the LP series is still going strong 13 years later!
1,"Quantum entanglement - I believe really it just means states are predetermined? Think of it like OOP - entangle(a,b)
where `entangle = (a,b) => a.spin.push(b.spin.pop())` then later if you measure `a.spin`, you automatically know what `b.spin` also is, because they have interacted. There is no actual communication from measurement, it was just pre-determined after the interaction - is the way I understood it."
0,Keep the well and also I enjoy the old quirky not super aesthetically nice part about your world it makes it feel like ethos world where it has always been just everything and random pop up builds that’s what sets your series apart from other series is how u almost capture old and new Minecraft in it and it has lots of memories I’ve been watching since chocolate island and still my favorite series and Minecraft YouTuber keep doing you etho
0,Change is not something to be afraid of
1,"Hey etho have you ever thought about doing the book curroption trick on the chunks you haven't built in

Yea it will take a long time but if you created a new world with the same seed you could see where everything is and if theres cool stuff in chunks you don't have any builds in you could get them without expanding your world"
1,Yea I wish you’d upload more frequently. Every time you do feels like a special gift ❤️
0,Loved the the new update
0,👏👏👏
0,I can’t believe you are still doing this ❤
0,IV Ben watching from the start
0,🐐
1,"17:43 Huh, well, I personally didn't know you could put moss on/above water like that. So, thanks! ^_^

Also, the cactus/cactus flower farm that launches the items seems like a fun idea. Neat stuff!"
1,Odd watching this as a mainly bedrock player as fallen trees have been in the game for ages
0,Pls come back
5,"Etho , i sometimes wish we could get a few more episodes than 20 each year :("
2,I check back into your channel every couple years to feel like I’m in middle school again.  Glad you’re still creating.
0,Onion science!
2,You are so talented. That final desert shot was beautiful
0,the toggleable redstone firefly particle thing could be used as a notification system that something is done
1,never change
0,To be honest... leaf litter looks like dog poop. It lacks ... color variation? Size variation?
0,I'd 'kinda' keep the well. I'd probably sink it down slightly or completely hide it somehow for some archaeology \ adventure vibes
1,Your minecraft world has been a part of my life for 12 years. I just want you to know how much you've inspired me. I'll never forget how blown away I was when you created the hopper clock. We love you Etho. Don't ever change❤
2,TF2 Engineer: 17:17
2,"Hey Etho, I was rewatching your hermitcraft season 10 from the beginning and just came across the part where you explained that when you were a kid, you wanted to make video games. It just so happens that my husband has been teaching programming and prefers to teach game programming. I'm sure he'd love to teach you if you were ever interested! His name on youtube is Thundosa. And he has also been streaming some coding lessons lately on twitch if you just wanted to learn a bit :)"
1,just bought minecraft again and thought of my goat!!
0,"Some 6 months later and I have finally caught up with equally many years of this series. It's impressive to see how Minecraft has developed and how this world has evolved with it. Thank you for all the entertainment that you have produced over the years and I look forward for the episodes to come!

Psst, I'm not too concerned about the snowflake, but the other floating building wouldn't suffer from some supporting structure if you're looking for another renovation project ;)"
0,"I feel like the desert well could look really good with a fence post/stair/slab raised roof and hanging greenery and details. I know that is the original design from the game, I think it would be cool to keep the original form and then add extra detail to make it fit in more, like people used to do with jungle temples/other generated builds."
0,"call nostalgic but honestly I prefer worlds that just have a bunch or co structures. I think a theme is nice sometimes but I  just remember when I first played on multi-player and everyone built near eachother, it was a constant clash of different things. it just feels cool"
0,Keep the well but spruce it up to match everything else better!!
0,Mr beast shouted out ethoslab on his video that came out today!
0,"Personally I believe that if something doesn't work where it is due to local themeing but you want to preserve history, then you can either move the build, or change the original build to preserve the memories but make it work with the new theming of the area."
0,Still waiting on Terraria 1.4 is EZ
0,"Probably late on this but please keep things like the well, the fact that it has a story is what makes your world so good. It's not just built for the sake of it, it was an organic bit of play from you years ago!"
2,ETHOSLAB WAS ON SINGAPOREAN NEWS PAPER YALL
0,just made 1.7.6b mob spawner thanks again!
1,I vote to keep the desert well! I think it's a charming reminder of the history of this series
1,I'm always scared seeing the uploads become less and less. Etho has a legacy that needs to live on forever.
0,Finally a beach episode!
2,@Ethoslab in the new snapshots they are buffing leads! Will we be able to ask “how you got the llamas to walk around sandy city like that?” Again?
0,Not seen this guy since 2017.. and he still uploads..
0,Dude I used to watch you back in like 2012 till like 2016 and I literally spent an hour trying to find you because I thought your name was echo and not etho Bro it feels so weird coming back and watching your videos because I was like 10 years old now I’m 20 I just think that’s crazy. I grew up watching you bro you’re like the best Minecraft you tuber ever.
0,If I may ask how do you get your first video popular
0,How you manage to rope in hundreds of thousands of viewers each episode is commendable.
0,"35:50 I don't get why people get grossed out by medical stuff.

I have a body, I kinda want to understand how it works and how I should take care of it!!!"
0,In which video was Etho answering the question if he will play or not Vintage Story? I kind of remember he thought the Terafirmacraft developers make it.
0,"Just been watching OOGE plays Spellbound caves, not seen this since it first came out. I loved Minecraft then, so much more simple."
0,"8:00 theres too much going on, trim down on the bushes"
1,"Hi Etho, I recently finished watching this entire Let's Play from Episode 1 and  just wanted to say that your pure joy at discovering new features even after all this time is one of the best parts of the series.
P.S. In regard to episode 600 'soon' is relative. At your current rate of 1 episode approximately every 2 months we won't reach it until September 2026, almost a year and a half from now."
0,Howdy Etho! I remember watching you play Don’t Starve and just started playing again. If you were to do another run of it would you want to do it solo or with someone?
0,We miss you eefo
1,"Etho! Look up a channel called why files, they have done a great job explaining all sorts of science topics including quantum physics and this really interesting experiment where these scientists shot a particle at a board that split it in half and when it was observed vs not observed they behaved differently. Which begs the question how does the particle know we are watching it? Very fascinating stuff. But yeah I highly recommend you research that topic and look up that channel. You would love it"
0,Etho would you ever stream on twitch again ?
0,just did a 20 episode marathon man what a ride
0,It brings me endless joy to return to your channel after years of being away and seeing that same intro! I have quite a backlog to enjoy ❤❤❤❤
0,"Who came here because ethos got
Mentioned in a new mrbeast video"
0,"I think you should keep the lava well, but I'm sentimental, so that's just me. Love the video as always ❤️"
0,everytime i come to check for new videos I understand a little more what the wolf in my sp world felt when I never returned
0,"Hey Etho, thank you so much for all of the videos over the years. I get excited every time you upload, ready with my snacks! I wanted to ask, whats your favorite minecraft update that's ever happened?"
0,I just watched youre first video with youre voice and this ine man so different
0,Hey ethos I don't know if you would care or see this message since im assuming you have many many backups but I just found one of your 2013 world downloads on an old usb I had and wanted to throw something down here
0,I think the well is good but I don’t see an issue with moving it somewhere nearby that’s a bit more convenient
0,Don’t get rid of the desert well!
0,"Etho check out ""Minecraft's new Super Fast Travel Method, The Wind Elytra Tunnel"""
0,Love that ethos still here I was like 9-10 now I’m 24 and etho was crazy even back then love to see it
0,"Hey Etho love the videos been watching for 11 years now. Question, does your skin under your jacket still have your face on it or did you ever switch it to the penguin head?"
1,You make life better
0,Etho laughs like Dr. Hibbert and I love it
0,Ethoslab still going strong ❤
0,"I have watched Etho for eons, always loved his unique building and insane red stone mechanics that only he understands lol,  I’m glad he’s getting more subscribers and more views for his hard work..    👍👍👍"
0,Definitely keep the desert well
0,Etho....I must know...have you also been addicted to Blue Prince lately
0,10:00 untouched crazy mountains are also good to watch <3
1,You gotta keep the well!
0,"im going to say that i care way, way more about personality than something being aesthetically appealing. as an artist, i can understand why, to you, it might not be so important. when you're the person making something, you see very clearly your own failures and patterns of growth and improvement at realizing your own vision. i am a staunch believer in minecraft as an art medium, and i think if there's anything you should never do, it's to delete or overwrite your old art (in this case, old builds). those are evidence of your growth as both an artist and a person, and by deleting them, you lose them forever. there is nothing i regret more in my life than throwing away countless drawings i made when i was a child, because i no longer have access to that part of my life that i thought was worthless at the time, but which i now cherish. 
all this to say, keep the little desert well. don't worry so much about not having a ""visually cohesive"" minecraft world. all the little quirks and incongruities of your world tell stories about who you are, and there is value in that.
i understand if you don't want to take it that seriously. i'm just really passionate about art and people, and how we preserve ourselves in daily ephemera. it can be a hindrance to cling too heavily to the past, but remembering old bits of fun, or your mistakes, or what you used to care about, and your past taste, these are all things worth keeping around in my opinion."
1,"Hey Etho,

One time you did a world tour with shaders. Looked pretty cool and showed off your world in a different light.


What if for the next tour you install distant horizons and preload the LODs? I think it would be cool to get a sense of where all the builds are in relation to each other."
1,"Hey Etho! 

After doing some reminiscing I was wondering if you would ever consider playing another superhostile game? I'm not sure if you can only play them on old versions but I was just thinking about how much I remember enjoying watching you play canopy carnage, legendary, and the videos with OOGE lol. Those times will always hold a special place in my heart.
Anyways, thank you for all that you do."
0,30:45 i think a big “sacred” tree would work really well there
0,"Thank you for the insights at the very end, Etho. I hadn't thought about intentionally working learning like financial, science and other into my and my family's lives. I grew up with it, with a dad who was an engineer and a mom who was a master gardener, but for my kiddos, I have been consuming more entertainment type things. I am also living the consequences of not having seen a problem before it became a big problem, and while I am not naturally drawn to things like financial info, it would really help to have a grasp of it and I am now learning very quickly to own it out of necessity, but some education and determination earlier would have definitely made a difference for us. As always, @Ethoslabs, your perspective is valuable and I appreciate the thought you bring to things. Thank you :)"
0,It’s crazy to think I first watched you when the first let’s play episode came out 14 years ago when I was 9 years old and now I’m going to turn 23 it’s crazy how time flys by so fast
1,I can’t Wait for the 600 Tour !!
0,I think you and Rekrap would get along well! You should do a crossover!
0,"Yay, etho"
0,"Hi etho! I’ve got a question, do you play any kind of instrument and what kind of music do you like?"
0,U can also till soil underwater btw
0,Ethos in the desert irl and lives in Canada??? That really only narrows it down to one spot and it’s the okanagan valley have I gotten that right????? 🤔 🤔
0,"Hey Etho. About a year ago you talked about being interested in playing Vintage Story. Since then the game has had several major updates and is in a very polished state right now. If you're still interested, there's never been a better time to get into it."
0,the office is a pretty good show
0,Don't you dare break that well 😭😭
0,I would say keep the desert well. It's been part of it for years and quite the memorable part too.
0,"I know I'm missing something but I can't figure it out;
could someone tell me why you can't break the third block of a cactus to handle all the flower scenarios?

It will harvest the flower of a 2+flower, and the third cactus of a 3+flower. I do understand it won't be anything close to lossless though."
1,Fire
0,I say leave the well but perhaps move it a bit
1,"It's not unfortunate that you don't have a ""unifying theme"". I think that's why I like watching your videos and following your journey. It is way more relatable to how I have always played Minecraft. Don't get me wrong - the theme builders are great too. But so is no theme :)"
1,"Just a quick thing i was thinking, to put some stone buttons in the desert also to make it more realistic! Just a thought, i love your videos"
0,"fun fact: okay for quantum physics and mechanics (i have studied it in courses because i am a STEM major in chemistry and a sub study in physics) , its the portion of physics that has many definitions but all definitions are correct, quantum mechanics and physics are in response to when things get so small or big that they are no longer governed by the laws of classical mechanics (newtonian physics) einstien and a lot of others pioneered the field because of their studies of light, the problem is that when it comes to quantum mechanics and physics that it is impossible to be 100% accurate because alot of it is completely theoretical, like the speed and position of a photo or electron, the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forbids anyone from telling both momentum ( mass and velocity ) and position, but by mapping out waveform and wave equations schrodinger was able to map out the concentration of electronic flow around the nucleus of the atom, of course quantum mechanics has alot of other things, where eisnstien proved that light ahs both a wave light property and a particle like property through the photoelectric effect. alot of stuff is revealed and broken by quantum mechanics because it defies our laws of physics that has governed our lives on earth, but the scope of quantum mechanics is what happens when you push the conventional thought of physics to both large and high extremes, in Etho's video he mentioned entanglement and speed of light, entaglemetn is when two particles of the exact same nature exist but are influenced by eachother no matter the distance, and the speed of light is the concrete barrier of the universe, because if you were to go close to the speed of light, you could travel forwards in time. just some fun facts if effo reads this because we're both science nerds, never felt prouder to be a nerd, love you etho!"
0,Random leaves on the sand looks like little piles of poop LOL
0,"Etho what are your thoughts on bundles? Some people seem to think they are only for early game, but I’ve found them to be super useful late game too, especially as a tool pouch.
Love the videos!"
0,The FPS is getting rough bro lol
1,"I love how excited Etho got about the cactus flowers and fire flies 😂. Also, please don’t get rid of the desert well."
0,"I find myself coming back to watch some videos over the years I remember when I was like 8 years old watching etho build the cave and I'm now 20 years old and this always brings me peace and tapping into my inner child, thank you etho for everything and always inspiring my younger self. keep doing this thing !!! P.S. I haven't finished watching the full video but I hope you still do fan comments at the end"
0,Can you pls upload another hermitcraft video
0,"Etho,
I died to your trapped desert well many, many years ago. I've been downloading your worlds for 10+ years, it's a pastime of mine... please keep it :)
I watch you because you were the MC content I started with... played the free MC weekend in '09 or '10 and bought it immediately (didn't even have redstone at the time)
Don't change a thing you do, your content defines Minecraft content.
- A very long time fan"
0,"yo please give us a throw back UHC season🥺🥺🥺 vintage beef, pause, guud, ect. I’ve been a fan for over a decade and those were my favorite videos to watch. ❤❤❤❤"
0,"yo etho, been watching your videos for awhile now and i know you've never told people what you did for a living before youtube, which is understandable as to why. My question to you is, how long until you made your youtube career into your full time job, assuming it is your full time job lol. Much love from a fellow Canadian <3"
0,Getting close to ep600! Can't wait for the world tour!!
0,10:51 KEEP THE WELL!!! It’s history!!!
0,1:46 I loved that classic chaos. I’m glad your world doesn’t have it!
0,"I think you should pretty up the desert well however you can, and keep it"
0,Do terra forma craft season 4
0,Doesn't your existing cactus farm just work as a cactus flower farm now?
0,I am glad to see you are still making content after all these years!(started watching in 2015 ) Great videos to watch while getting back into the swing of things with minecraft after a few year hiatus. <3. Keep the well!
1,Why do some people play Minecraft with clouds turned off? 😭
0,HOLY COW! YOU'RE STILL AROUND?! I remember when you made Wilson in your cave! I tried to do that 11 years ago as well. Oh I hope you're doing great! SO HAPPY YOU ARE STILL UPLOADING!!!!
0,Instead of destroying the well why not improve the well? Make it part of the landscape as if it was meant to be there! I think it would be a nice way to pay respects to the original build and it becomes something pleasant to look at.
0,"Echoing a lot of other comments here, but keep the well and keep the craziness and disorganization. We watch you for you!"
0,"Etho you are the best, haven’t watched you in awhile but have been a sub for 15 years"
0,"Hey Etho, been a viewer since elementary school and now well into my college career. I was wondering, do you ever go back and watch your old videos or series? I've been journaling for a while, and I find myself reading old sections from time to time to see what my thoughts were then. And you have hundreds of hours of content spanning over a decade, I for one probably would look back. On top of that, I know I am very nostalgic for my own memories of playing Minecraft years ago, I wonder what it is like to actually have access to all that."
0,"I really like the history of the well, and I think you should keep it. You might want to make it look like a preserved site, with iron bars or some kind of small barrier around it."
0,"hey etho! remember that weird intro you did in episode 525? been watching your old vids lately as me an all my friends are falling back into Minecraft. love your farms an just the way you play the game. much love! oh! forgot the question. will you ever do another modpack series in the future? if so, do you know how far that is? totally understand if it's far future."
0,"Etho, I said this a few years ago.. please make a second channel! record all your collection and stuff, it could be long episodes and you don't even need to talk.. obviously you know a lot of people love your voice, but also seeing how you traverse the world and collect your materials would be incredible and would certainly get a lot of watchtime!"
0,does he play in the same world?
0,what about moving the well to the empty area on the left?
0,I sprained my wrist really badly and I've been using the Etho desk/mouse set up to get through my classwork! Thanks Etho!
0,bro this intro KASdkaksd
0,Jenna!!!!
0,"26:25 I feel like I’m going crazy but weren’t fallen trees a thing already or was that just bedrock? I swear I’ve seen fallen trees in my world a long time ago.

Indeed I looked upon the wiki and silly pocket edition, my beloved, has had fallen trees for forever. Glad to know I’m not insane, though maybe I am for playing pocket edition…"
0,"Hey Etho, was wondering if you were a fan of tabletop games and what some of them might be. You seem to love the hermitcraft tcg so much after all. And a long time back you tried remaking one or two games in the world too. Dominion, Camel Up, Dixit and Marvel Legendary are some of my favorites."
0,"Etho, you feel like home"
0,Hey Etho I have been watching sense I was 6 and I’m now 17 it’s been a amazing adventure and your videos bring me soo much joy. I’m happy to see your still making them
1,I would snack the
0,Definitely keep the well
0,"Just went and checked out the Episode 500 world download I have after remembering him mentioning it this episode, and of course after 5 minutes I end up dying to general spaz. You got me Etho :]"
0,17:50 You can do this with regular carpets too!
0,i love the desert well!!!
0,12 years later and this is still my comfort videos
0,Etho! TFC has another fun update! Ever thinking of doing another TFC playthrough?
0,"You know - these updates are great; but, I do feel the game would be different if it started like this. What I mean is, these updates are awesome because of the evolution of the game. It makes it more enjoyable to play. Love your videos Etho!"
0,upgrade the well! i love it being a silly little thing there but with some tweaks it can be blended in to the new terrain
0,I think moving the well would be a good middle solution.  Just put it in a better spot!
0,"Heytho, I was wondering, have you seen the new Minecraft movie? If you have, what did you think of it, if you haven't, are you planning on seeing it?"
0,Currently listening to Vampire Empire by Big Thief
0,"You gotta keep all your previous builds, keep the history alive! Work to blend them in with the new projects, maybe turn them into ruins if it fits the need better"
1,Hey Etho with your world being as old as it is and you having to explore further and further every new update have you considered just deleting parts of your world just so you can regenerate with the newest features? As always thank you for doing what you're doing and stay awesome.
0,Etho the Minecraft gardener
0,The firefly bushes remind me of blinkroot from terraria! It might be a nice addition to caves.
0,Hey Etho! I would love to see you do a series on Craftoria if that interest you !
0,"Hey Etho, now that winter is over (at least where I am, two false springs....) what are you looking forward to the most this summer??"
12,"Hey Etho, Idk if you have noticed or if someone else has pointed it out - but the last world tour was on September 3rd 2020. If you timed it so Episode 600 released on September 3rd 2025- itd be exactly 5 years :O"
0,You should do terraria 1.4 is EZ
0,"Thank you for your comment on actively learning about things. I think it's very easy these days to just consume the content algorithms give us, rather than seek out information that teaches us and informs the way we solve problems and understand our world."
0,nice
0,I’ve always watched Etho growing up every mentions all the other Minecraft YouTubers but never Etho I’m grown up now but every now and then I watch Etho he’s the one YouTuber I’ll never get tired of watching. Etho was the first ever YouTuber I’ve watched from a app called “Ethoslab” I don’t see it anymore in the App Store but I sure do remember it but Etho is one of the best I’ve ever watched and hope he does stop anytime soon
0,"the mesa area looks great, the well should stay, or be moved."
0,I would say no do not remove the  desert well. It’s a nostalgic part of your world.
1,"Replace the desert well with an identical red sandstone well. That way you get to keep the homage, and it transitions your deserts together 🏜"
1,I love you keeping the history of your world! You have ample room to build new stuff lol
0,As a rule of thumb id say always leave everything line the well and the sand thing. I think the eclectic style of various builds is what makes your world so unique and relatable.
1,Are you going to go see the Minecraft movie
0,Etho I just checked your library on your LP world and it only goes up to E670. Is this foreshadowing! like the Mayan calendar of your LP world.
0,30:44 Move the well to this corner!! solves 2 problems at once!
0,"@6:33 EEEEK, you can see a sliver of dirt through the cracks. Someone didn't fill in their corners."
0,I know the exact blue LED video he is referring to lol
0,"Hey Etho, what's your favorite movie?"
0,"I haven’t watched this man in so many years… I’m glad he still uploads, and he’s one of the people I wish I could meet in real life as a legend from my childhood since I was about 10…. I’m 28 now and boy life is beautiful and such a journey, but I never forgot about you good sir etho. Much love and thank you for always being someone I have looked up to. Stay blessed but please never stop creating content. Someday I’ll have to catch up on the years I’ve missed 🫶🏼

Kids. Etho’s the OG of content and also in depth contraptions.. trust me watch his series he’s done and still has going, like the one I’m commenting on. You won’t be disappointed. 
Much love man 😌"
0,I think the well should stay where it is
0,E to the T to your mum <3
1,You should do a world tour
0,I think it would be cool to keep the well and maybe relocate it to that corner you said should have a structure! That way you keep the history but have more of an open space where you just did the majority of the landscaping and 'perdifying
1,F3: RTX 2060 ... Etho... my guy...  i will GiFT you a newer card! Just that the words:
0,"Etho, did you get the Mace yet? If not are you still going to pursue getting it?"
1,"I see what you did there, but scrap the well."
1,"Hey Etho, I was just wondering if you happened to see what squibble made with wind charges. I think one of his inventions would pair perfectly with your storage system. Squibble basically made a better enderpearl stasis chamber that can be activated from anywhere."
0,It looks like the main problem with the leaf litter placement is that it depends on your orientation. I think I might get sick from all the turning. :P
0,"Amazing episode, so comforting, love ya!"
0,I really appreciate the fact you decide to keep your old builds and spend the time to blend them in to what you want to do. I remember well when you built the sand converter!!
0,you really nailed the mesa section. It looks great and I'm proud of you for your progress on terraforming!
0,another etho therapy <3 thank you
0,"Honestly this update wasnt that bad despite being small, for me it really gave more life to minecraft worlds"
0,"Hey Etho, staying on the topic of science. How do you feel about Canadas Power generation? What do you think the future of power in Canada is? Nuclear/Gas/Both?"
34,"2:07 - I don't think your world not having a theme isn't an unfortunate thing. I think that's what Minecraft is. The fact any world can be as creative and unique as the person that plays it. It's amazing to see these medieval worlds, sci-fi, greek and such, but I find beauty in seeing a huge building very next to a space ship very next to a giant creeper statue. Rather than seeing this as a wasted opportunity, see it as an unlimited potential to build whatever you want without caring if it fits the color palette or the theme of the world."
0,Hey etho! How is chocolate island doing? I'm assuming you still have the world. How do you keep it backed up and is the process stressful? Seems so terrifying with the updates to not lose the lp world or others. Never know what they will change and how it can effect world saves.
0,"Hi Etho, do you read you comments? If you do please reply."
0,"I haven't finished the video yet but I do really like the new terraforming! I think you have improved immensely :)
I do also think the lava well should stay. It's a very old relic from the past, and I think even if you would like to keep a consistent theme, cursed desert lava well lurking outside the bounds of sandy city is cool.
tbh I don't think you should force yourself to do as others do, nor do I think you should keep everything the same forever. I think whatever style of content and building and so on that you enjoy, will be enjoyable to the rest of us, because people change and their inspirations change. 
Etho is what has kept me watching Ethoslab Videos. Not minecraft, or minecraft trends, or even nostalgia for the older days; and I believe others can say the same.
Thx for another video :)"
0,Love the new desert
0,Etho when are you going to do another Pokemon series
0,"100% keep the well, its iconic"

0,"As the cactus flower is nice, I feel like (unless otherwise told) this can make cactus farms kinda a pain cause if you have a flower growing at either 1-2 tall cactus, and they dont break with a block next to it, it’ll block production if it grows at those heights? Am I wrong? Yes you can use a piston or observer but like if you want mass production and the obverse is at 3 tall and it grows at 1-2. Then it ruins it? Idk may just be me"

You and the community probably know many smaller channels that would deserve more eyes on them, and could be an interesting angle to present one at the end of an episode.

If so, that was a good one."

0,"Quantum physics is overall easier than classical non-relative mechanics or EM in a theory or mathematical sense.

0,7:54 This is definitely a hit for me—great job with the terraforming!
0,11:38 What if you made a museum for the little things in your world that you weren’t sure if you should keep. This way you could keep some of the history —more than just from the original video—of the things that have long stopped working or would otherwise serve no purpose.

0,"I'd say keep the desert well, but pretty it up a bit. Change some bits around, add some detailing that isn't there on the vanilla ones, find a way to work it into the environment a bit more... that sorta thing."
0,You could upgrade or transform the desert well
0,11:00 I think you should move the well to that other small desert area off to the left behind the orange structure. That way you can keep the history but clean up the bigger area because imo its a bit out of place
0,"love how you first decided to polish the desert BEFORE the update and yet most of the new blocks got used for it, peak foreshadowing"
2,"I like that there's no unified idea. All those themed youtube worlds feel like they're putting pressure on me to also have a unified theme in my world, but I don't want to"
1,"Hi Etho! One thing you might consider with your foliage placement in the new mesa teraformed area is where the water will go when it rains. You’ve already got something that looks like a dried basin where it’s drier in the middle than it is in the sides, which really looks great. When I’ve been in the desert, the lower elevation areas tend to have less or shorter foliage because they would be the areas where the water sticks around longest after it rains so it would get washed away in a flash flood. You already seem to be heading n that direction, but it’s just something I thought about. Great video as always! Have a wonderful day!"
0,Moving the well down near that empty area you mentioned building a “new grass farm” could be a good way to maintain the history without it being in an odd spot
0,"As an artist. sayi g you dont have a  theme reminds me of artists saying they dont have a ""style"" Every artist has a style/theme naturally. I think your world does have a theme - its Etho. Everything sorta just works together just because youve made everything. 

Also, not having a major storyline makes 500+ episodes a lot more digestible. People can start wherever, and theyre not gonna be overwhelmed with lore."
0,Leave the well! It's history :)
0,11:00 Keep the well Etho! That's history right there
1,"I’d move the well down into the empty end of your little desert, right in front of where you’re thinking of putting another little mesa. I think it would give a reason why the wall extends down that way."

0,that desert landscaping turned out amazing!! i love that colour palette mixed in with the bright sand.
0,"Leave the desert well. It’s ugly, but one thing I love about your world is all the tiny landmarks that have accumulated over time. Plus, the new landscaping around it makes the area look nice, even if there’s nothing particularly exciting about well itself."
0,"It's cool when you place them. But when you have clear bushes for every build it gets a little annoying. Obviously I have played a lot of modded minecraft. That happens a lot in modded minecraft. You get a bunch of random junk that adds interest to the world, but at the same time, when YOU want to do something all of that stuff suddenly becomes an annoying obstacle in your way. There is a balance somewhere."

One option would be for elytra to work differently in different dimensions so they would still be effective in the end."
0,"Hi Etho,
I know you've touched on this before but it was especially apparent to me in today's episode with the goal of pertying up the place. I'd love to see some very basic, vanilla-adjacent shaders in your videos. I was especially struck by it around the time in the vid that you were talking about blue LEDs. Minecraft's blue gradient skies just don't match your beautiful structures, custom trees, etc. I agree one of the amazing things you've done with this series is keeping it vanilla, but it just doesn't do your builds or your world justice. Even a nice sky box with no fancy lighting features would do wonders in my opinion. Keep on keeping on! Thanks!"
1,"Etho, you don't need a theme. This world represents your journey, and that's all that matters.

I also wouldn't be too scared about changing your content. I think you'll find that a lot of your subscribers are long term fans...

0,Nooo etho dont get rid of the well...
0,"My first thought at 19:57 was ""don't eat the brown sand"" lol."
0,You should move the well to the left in the little nook you got going on. Then it’s a nice structure to show some history to your world without getting rid of it. Like so Ergo can see

0,I could watch these random build/clean/explore videos all day!

0,love the chaotic style of building that you do!
0,You've poured so many diamonds into that well. I think it's a treasure to the world. So maybe replace the well with something that pays homage to it.
0,The sand sounds like creepers and it was stressing me out the whole video
0,"I want to chime in that I love the chaotic, storied look of your world! Especially with your LP being one of the oldest in existence, I think that's part of the charm! Not that new developments or changes are bad, but I certainly don't think anyone is looking at features of the world and thinking they are outdated and therefore bad."
0,"Edit: Argh, I don't like the cactus flower mechanics. That breaks passive cactus farms if you don't use pistons... I do like everything else in the update though. I'm actually impressed on the side of ""more features"" rather than less. There aren't major structure changes (a lot of work but nonetheless affecting only a small area), but I feel like the world is more immersive now.

I've also seen the blue LED video. That was fascinating. One of the better explanations of band-gaps I've seen, but wow does that stuff still confuse me. I start getting a headache whenever I try to think about how colors are a result of weird quantum stuff and needing to shape molecules to have the right quantum bands to be new colors in the visible range... structural colors are really cool though.


I don't want to see the world getting a ""theme."" You already have one. I'll admit, if you make a dedicated biome change, like when you did the wheat field, sure, that's cool. But we started watching because you're a technical builder. Your world is full of devices you've made that do something, and the landscape is built around them (so, to that effect, adding landscapes around builds is good, and I love how the mini-mesa looks). I like that the landscape also looks nice, and it's been amazing to see your skill at that improve over the years, but I don't want you to lose that ability to make cool tech first and megabases second.


As for whether to remove old builds that can't function anymore (like the sand converter)... I have mixed feelings. Sure, if a design is broken by an update and just needs modernized because Redstone works differently now, fishing changed mechanics for the 18th time, or just can be made more efficient, I think it can replaced or updated in place. But something that was removed from the game, like the sand or old ice farms... on one hand, historical value. On the other hand, something else could go there. I'm honestly undecided on that part.

Please keep the desert well, though. That's definitely historical material and it's not ""nonfunctional."" Admittedly, it's not horribly functional either, but there's no reason to get rid of it."
0,you have to keep the well!
1,"Leave the old stuff!! The big sand farm, should just build something around it!"
0,I would keep the desert well. Maybe move it to that place that you said needed a structure?
0,"Instead of a wall by the river, why not extend the desert down to the river?"
0,You could move the well to the little side area where you suggested the farm goes. That way you get to keep it while also opening up the main desert area
3,"Tip for anyone trying to replicate the flower farm that Etho demonstrated here. If you run into the issue that the pistons don't work properly it might be an orientation thing. Facing North might not work, but facing South does. And facing West doesn't work, but facing East does. That kinda thing."
0,Keep the well! It's history! Maybe add a roof that ties it into the new area a little better?
167,"I’ve finally done it. I watched every single episode of Etho Plays Minecraft Season 2. 486 episodes starting at 105 and ending at 591. It seemed like such a big task when I began yet here I am, quite sad that I don’t have 100 more episodes to watch. 

I still remember the first video I watched from you 12 years ago. I think it was episode 290. I used to watch other youtubers playing minecraft survival at my school library’s computers, but they didn’t get very far or technical with the game. One day a guy came up to me and asked “Do you want to see what real minecraft survival looks like?” and pulled up your channel. I was fascinated at how advanced you were at the game, yet I understood nothing (neither the game mechanics nor english).

Years later I rediscovered your channel and watched your videos on and off with the goal in mind that one day I would watch your entire survival series, and I finally did it.

Throughout the series a few things stuck out:

How you and your episodes changed significantly while not changing much at all. You became livelier, more dynamic and charismatic, and as a consequence (coupled with the current standard of videos on youtube) the quality of the episodes improved a lot while barely changing the formula that you always stuck to. You’re still the same man who views doing youtube primarily as a fun hobby and focuses on bringing new, creative ideas to the table instead of appealing to the current trends. I do admit that I miss the “Let me see... what will we do today?” of the older episodes back when simpler videos we’re the standard, though.

Your progress with redstone and building. Your progress in redstone skills was like a flight of stairs, and there were three main steps: the pop-up sheep farm, Wilson, and the Nexus, after which you became the redstone wizard that you are. Your building, on the other hand, was like a map composed of mountains and valleys. One episode you would build something amazing, then turn around and build, well, the Ender Dragon egg room (the old one, of course), yet after a while, through persistent effort you became the amazing, consistent builder that you are nowadays.

The way your world changed in the last 100 episodes. Before, it was neat collection of structures, projects and builds, but after you started your biome enhancement project you made your world more cohesive, structured and pleasant to look at. In my opinion, not only is your world the greatest survival world in minecraft, but also the most famous/iconic. It contains the first iterations of redstone contraptions that are staples nowadays, and it is recognized at a distance by millions, as it has been a part of the childhood of people who are now adults with degrees, jobs, and/or a family.

And the thing that kept me more amused than anything was seeing when certain structures or contraptions were built and when things that are old news nowadays were added to the game. Every other episode I found myself thinking ""Oh my God, *this* is when he built this?"" or ""This was added *that* long ago to the game? It felt like yesterday."" I was surprised at how early on you mentioned the Nexus or how certain iconic parts of your world were built so casually. For example, the episode where you began building the entrance to the man cave doesn't even mention that in the title even though it is a very important part of the build.

Something else that stood out was the ""recent"" change in your mindset when it comes to farms. Before you didn't mind afking at all and you often prioritized originality/creativity over eficiency: your original design of the witch farm reflects that best. Also, the designs have certainly increased not only in size but complexity, which I guess is in part due to the saturation of minecraft content on this platform but also due to this mindset change.

Anyways, there’s obviously much more to say but this is boring enough as is, so here’s a quick question: is Pakkun still alive?

Thanks for entertaining and inspiring millions of people. You're one of the greatest youtubers of all time, that's for sure."
0,"He is alive! 🤗 Just kidding, its actually not that long since he uploaded, but i am just picky and only like the singleplayer stuff 🙃"
0,"Something I was hoping to see was the cactus flowers attracting bats in the same way bees ""pollinate"" flowers in this game. Lots of species of cactus are bat pollinated. I guess it'd be tricky to implement without killing the bats. 

Cactus farm efficiency has been thoroughly nuked this update with the flowers growing at any stage and not breaking when adjacent to a block. This hurts as cactus remains the only viable means of getting green dye in bulk and I wonder if the developer considered that when implementing the change."
0,You should keep the well but since it's man made I think you should be allowed to move it to a better location
0,"I would say keep it as its fairly nostalgic for me, but maybe hide it from sight by wrapping it in 'desert trees' or the like so its something visitable but not part of the general feel of the area as you are passing through."
0,"You should totally leave the fountain! Maybe even build around it like it's an old monument, or sculpture. Heck, maybe you could create story around it with the right builds that just give the impression ""Some guy just left this here and we don't know what to do with it..."""
0,"I have a fond memory of that desert well trap, but it is entirely up to you what you do with it! The design in that desert strip looks great!"
0,"The way the bush and firefly bush spread when bonemealed, should be added to lilypads too.
Also I wish you could harvest the dry grass and make it into a dry grass mat, that has similar mechanic to carpets. Just so we can have some beige/sand colored carpets."
0,"Leave the history. I think a lot of it is way cooler than the potential ""upgrade"" that would replace them."
0,"I think you should remove the self made desert monument, because it doesn't add anything unique to the area so less is better in this sense. Furthermore I would tone down a lite bit on the terrain details, in this case the colors stand out a lot so decluttering it a little bit makes sense. Anyhow amazing video! Its allways nice to see a new upload :)"
0,Not sure if you’ll see this but it might be a good idea to clump the desert grass near structures or natural stone. All the crevices of the structures and stone could potentially hold water that would help the plants grow. Kinda like how you see weeds around the edges/cracks of driveways.
0,"Terraforming isn't really for me, I think the history of the world and the changes is cool. Who cares if things don't blend in, that's half the fun! It will be interesting to see in another 10 years if people are still terraforming and blending, or if they've moved on (or backwards) to something else."
0,"If you feel the well doesn't fit, then it doesn't.
I love the building episodes, btw ! Awesome custom biome !"
0,"I like the well and maybe you could move it to the empty space on the other side of the path? It feels like the perfect space for it to me. Also I'm not the biggest fan of the scattered leaves in the open space  but maybe with the cluttered new grass it looks a bit better. Over all I love the improvements on the desert! Whenever I watch you design something, you always challange what I think goes well together. Every time I'm sceptical at the beginning but it ends up looking great! For example this time, I was sure the tuff would stand out too much and be too harsh of a texture but you blended it in so well. Love it!"
0,"Hi Etho, why not use that small area to the left of the sand converter to house the well? Maybe change the well to have a bit more mesa coloration in it as well. 

Love the videos, I've been watching since chocolate island and you're the best notification to pop up on my feed. I always have my snacks ready!"
0,"Oh, I saw that blue LED video I think. It was super interesting. :)"
0,Great vid Etho!
0,"Move the well to the other deserty bit using the exact same blocks, and redo the well there to fit the theme :)"
0,After 591 episodes this is the firsts I’ve watched in an airport
0,"maybe keep the desert well, but redesign it"
0,Not just moss carpet you can place on water. Any wool carpet can be too
0,Mojang **SPoiLing** us by making more decorative blocks placeable on most block😂😂🤩
0,I wouldn't stress too much about your world not having one big theme. You and this world are cut from a different cloth compared to these newer worlds and I think that your world having just random things is a nice thing that makes it unique.
0,Id say retexture the desert well slightly. Just a little revamp to make it blend in a but better but keep the structure!
0,remove the sand fountain with the lava
0,28:03 I am pleasantly surprised too. I honestly thought they would look way more aggressive/busy.
0,keep the well
1,"Hey Etho! I was wondering, what are your thoughts on pruning chunks? have you ever done it in your world? The thought came to me when i remembered you where considering changing your world from  an amplified world back to default, now with chunk blending, there aren't harsh chunk borders when changing version (which i always found ruined my immersion) so i was wondering if you've considered pruning chunks along some of the old version change chunk borders and letting them regen with the new blending. Also, I wanted to add my thoughts on switching to default, I thing there are positives, as its really difficult to build in amplified terrain, and you already have amplified terrain to use if you want to, default would let you explore and build in new biomes and features without the added chaos, hope you're doing well!"
0,"I love the desert well, just cover it with a few leaves it’ll look fine lol"
0,"Loved the terraforming episode! Hey Etho, can you clean up the portal room below the stronghold base next?"
0,Leave the well please. You killed me with it when i downloaded the world - it's history
0,Please keep the desert well!
0,dont get rid of the well it tells a story if you put more dry grass around it it might blend in better this my first comment i have been watching for 7 years keep being an amazing youtuber you are the first youtuber i ever watched so thanks you for showing me the youtube comunity
0,Save for the well❤❤
0,8:26 me when I break the grass of pain and agony 💔
0,"Finally something mostly unrelated to redstone. lol
As someone who quit MC so long ago it's like the least relatable and thus enjoyable content. So you working on overly complex redstone circuits is about as entertaining as watching someone write code with me not being able to actually read it (not dissing anyone who finds enjoyment in that)."
1,@veritasum Call out !!
0,Keep the well! I died to it!
0,Heyo I’ve had the worst week ever so thank you etho
0,Gotta keep the well. Just update it to fit the area
0,"I think it would be unfortunate for you to tear down old builds just because they don't fit the newer vision of Minecraft. That world is a piece of history on its own, I hope you don't modernize it too much."
0,7:30 oh that's a *lovely* scrubland 👍👍
2,"Cohesive worlds are awesome and perfectly suited for builders like Bdubs Ross, but Etho's world has its own direction that better matches his playstyle."
0,"It’s a little thing, but I love that Etho actually fills in spaces rather than just covering them up"
0,don't take down the desert well!
0,"17:55 you can place any type of carpet on water and lava
Also, if you want a fun channel to learn about animals, I recommend ""Casual Geographic"""
0,"Honestly at the end with all the stuff, the well doesn't really look that out of place anymore lol"
0,"DON'T TOUCH THE WELL!
Make it work."
0,"I agree with a what a lot of people here are saying about make sure to keep your style and don't feel like you have to do stuff you don't neccessarily want to do, although if you do want to do it, then thats your prerogative completely. Loved the episode, hoping we can get some more soon."
0,Etho confirmed to be a Technology Connections enjoyer
0,"the desert grass in the mesa looks surprisingly good, wonderful contrast."
0,"hey it looks great etho, good job"
0,Must keep the well 👍
0,"make it a split down the middle type aproach, keep it with a revamp to match the current scenario it finds itself in, is wahat i suggest"
0,Keep the well
0,"I did not know you could use moss as a bridge, thank you so much that's huge"
0,"11:40 You could ""move"" the well to a different spot? It's not a massive build so wouldn't be too tricky and then every time you'd see it, you'd have the added history to it of it being moved rather than wiping it from history entirely."
0,The well stays
0,Are you able to put cactus flower on top of moss carpet? With that moss carpet on water you could make giant lily pads…even for a frogger game or oasis/swamp
0,"Etho, I hope you read this, I've been watching your videos sinds I was maybe 14, which is half my life. 
I've moved on now, you've been awesome man. 
Thank you for the fun."
180,"Yo Etho I just realized - I am a grown ass man now, 32 years old. I’ve been watching your content since like what….. episode 6 into chocolate island?! Duuuuude it’s been so long and guess what: I still drop everything I am doing when you upload! New videooooo <3 Thank you so much for all the years man ❤"
0,"Etho, I’ve been watching you since I was a young lad. I’ve spent countless hours playing Minecraft watching your videos building amazing things creating some of the best memories with my brothers. I am now 25 and have a son, I can’t wait to show him your videos and play with him."
6,"""If you aren't learning something every day..."" I had a Pavlovian reaction waiting for the Brilliant sponsorship, but of course it was just Etho giving life advice 😊"
0,"Etho! We know you love to read, watch and learn about things. What’s the best book you’ve ever read that taught you valuable real world useful knowledge?"
0,"I like that your builds don't have 'one unifying theme' !!! It's definitely more creative and really showcases the history of your world ^^ plus, I think one thing that minecraft builders miss, especially when making cities and stuff, is that... even in the real world, uniformity doesn't exist. Most places have a lot of diversity in their architecture, whether it's because of differently used materials, different builders, different eras.... etc. And that's why a lot of minecraft towns feel kinda unrealistic to me. Almost dystopian in a way.. cause everything looking the same and harmonious betrays either EXTREMELY TIGHT organisation and planning.. or a lack of allowed creativity, or both. So!! This kinda turned into a rant, but I love your world, and your whole vibe, so please don't loose that unique spark that you have in favor of being like everyone else. We love you cause you've always been yourself above all <3"
0,Move the well over to the new cornor where you want to build some structures
0,I just realized ive been watching ethos for 12 years unsubscribed 😞😭
0,"Hey ergo, I think that maybe keeping the well but turning it into an abandoned one could be a cool refresh while also preserving history."
0,What if you moved the well to the back left corner where you would talking about adding a structure for farming the plants? that way you keep the history but it's less in the way
1,"I'm only 30 seconds into the video, and just want to say right off the bat that these polishing episodes are some of my absolute favorites throughout the LP series. There's obviously so much enjoyment in the grandiose projects and redstone innovation, but something about walking through the old world with new materials, tips and tricks hits SO hard EVERY time.

Editing at 7:35 ETHOOOOOMG THIS IS WHY THESE EPISODES GO SO HARD EVERY TIME"
0,"I love the lava well and how quirky it is, but don't be afraid to move it to another section if you think you need to"
0,"hey etho, possibly east solution for the cactus flowers: why not break the cactus that’s second from the bottom? might lose efficiency, but you could gain efficiency with scale"
0,Pls leave the desert lava well
0,"Hi Etho, Are you excited for the Minecraft movie?"
0,Is there a youtube channel that would allow me to learn new things every day?
30,"Thank you for answering my partner's question as the Comment of the Day. We started yelling when we saw it pop-up. I'm glad it was such a thought-provoking question and I hope it leads to many rabbit holes for you (and not the kind you twist your ankles in, in England)! To say that quantum physics has changed our lives is an understatement. I hope you find many adventures as you dive into the world of the unknown!  We love you, Etho! Keep up the great work in making your world fun.  (You've also inspired a lot of physics enthusiasts to come out of the woodwork with that comment!)"
0,Love the mesafication!
0,"Oh look! Etho's talking about my area of research! So, the best way to think about entanglement is my mind is to think of it as one massive particle with 2 sides, where the 2 sides are like the sides of a coin. So, if you measure one side of it, of course the other side changes instantly since it's one particle, but also, of course you can't send useful information along it instantly, since, if you flip a coin and see one side is heads, you now know the other side is tails, but that doesn't give you any useful information.

(unless you also communicate about you're measurements, but that means you're communicating below light speed again)"
0,"I feel like the mesa terrain has way too much variety/complexity for being right next to a desert. I would simplify it and remove some blocks completely, like less types of leaves for example"
0,does the new cactus flower break most cactus farms now? because the 1 tall cactuses have a chance of growing a flower instead of a cactus?
0,"The new update is so well done. More life in nature is the exact thing minecraft needs. BTW the ""problem"" with your plant placement is that they are space too evenly. Same thing as when children try to draw a sky with stars. They always space them evenly instead of in clusters."
0,wowww super impressed with the desert terraforming. great colors
0,"I think you should keep the well because you physically made it and it would be sad to see it go but thats just me, if you want to get rid of it that's your choice, sorry if that wasn't helpfull lol"
0,"quantum entanglement goes faster than light. It's almost retro causality. I think about something I've heard where a photon does not experience time. From it's point of view, it is both emitted and absorbed at the same time(time dilation). So it could be seen as something that connects the universe and possibly transmits information about what absorbed it(thus, what's in that direction a billion years from now). It really hints that time is weirder than we think... or that it doesn't really exist how we think it does"
0,Etho have you tried vintage story yet?
2,33:10 34min and 6sec is the optimal time between harvests. (Calculated it from random tick rate of blocks and linked binomial distributions)
0,What if you made the old sand converter building into a scam roadside attraction that claims it can convert sand but it's really just slight of hand
0,Put a fence around the desert well and treat it like a tourist attraction.
0,"I really like te leaf litter, but how cool would it be if we could dye the creaker resin!"
0,@Etho what if you make the redsand building into like something similar to a corruption? Kinda like the crimson in terraria!
0,"2 things!

about terraforming: when decorating, smaller spaces, i think it is important to decorate in clusters instead of sprinkling your deco out so evenly, because you want the eyes to travel from one interesting little spot to another only a few times as you walk around, and when deco is spread around so evenly, then it gets very busy for the eyes, and they have to basically hop around too many not-so interesting spots, which might have an effect you dont want.

and the other point: the desert bushes could look hella cool if you place a few patches within your wheat fields, to have it be a little less monotone! idk tho, havent tested it yet."
1,I'll save you some time if you decide to build a cactus flower automated farm that doesn't use observers. The optimal harvest time is in 34 minute intervals (34 min 6 sec) if you harvest the top 2 blocks :)
0,Rip the massive sugar cane farm
0,"I had an idea for if you ever wanted to blend your snowflake farm with the surrounding environment.  Create a localized area of winter around the base of the water stream, like it's a terraforming UFO."
0,good epsiode etho! :D
0,Etho! Will you play Vintage Story ??
0,Please play Vintage Story.
0,desert well has GOTTA stay
2,"Please keep the history, it's one of the things that make your world unique! Although I only have been watching this series for a couple of years, the bits I love are the experimenting with new updates, and the relaxed pace of those episodes - the massive projects are cool as well, due to your unique take on things, but this episode was reminiscent of earlier Minecraft videos - and I love it!"
0,"Hey Etho, I just want put this question out, so you have the option to respond to it if you want. Why do you give so little ""etho lore"" to the fans, like your growing up stories, you family stuff, if you have a girlfriend/wife and kids, car stories, do you have pets now, what is your address, okay the last might be too much don't answer that, so why do you chose not to disclose much about yourself? Are you afraid someone like rainbolt will track you down?"
0,Definitely keep the well!
0,We Keep It.
0,You should upgrade the desert well and call it a part of the Biome Enhancement Project.
0,I feel like the fireflies would also be cool in a fire type terrain like what rendog built a few hermitcraft seasons back to give the feel of like ash or cinders flying around
0,I would keep the well just blend it in
0,"Hey etho! For the 600 episode special you should do a clip montage like the 200 episode special, I think it would be really cool to see some highlights over the years. Just an idea"
0,"Thank you SO much for answering my question! Quantum physics can be very confusing. I’d been lucky enough to take a class back when I was in college that covered quantum physics, and it was life changing. The more you start to understand, the more questions you end up with, haha! But it’s very fascinating—definitely watch videos on it that interest you!

And these are some of my favorite types of videos from you! It was really fun, and I always learn something new! You’ve come so far in your building/decorating/terraforming, and it’s so inspiring!"
0,"An idea for deprecated and historical structures in your world which no longer fit in with the overarching theme, like the red sand converter in the desert: you could encase them in a modern building with glass walls and everything and turn them into a museum, with books/signs telling their history and their age, and have a little historical world tour ready for anyone exploring the world."
0,The terrain looks so great
1,Those firefly bushes would look great in de main cave. Imagine having it sparkle all fantasy like.
1,"It isn't just moss carpet but any carpet you place on water. It's good for maps where you can use frost walker, place the carpet on the ice and when the ice melts the carpet stays."
0,you could make a hidden trail with fireflies to guide someone
0,"30:39 I think the well would be a perfect structure to put here! It would tie together that area perfectly imo, and as a relic of the past i think the fact that it stands out and doesn't fit in with the rest of the place actually gives the area more character and depth, like an old historic statue in an otherwise modern town"
0,Get some bunnies and hide their lead. I think the only thing missing is a little “life”.  Beautiful world!
0,please keep the desert well! maybe replace some of the blocks and pimp it out but it's history and small structures are cool which is exactly why they were added to the game all those years ago
0,"Greetings Etho!  I've designed a cacti farm using the double piston design that you showed in this video. I'm not a professional redstoner, but I discovered that you may want to join all the piston mechanisms by the block where the redstone repeater is looking at and not by the glazed terracotta (or the not movable block) one. Why? Because in my design I connected a hopper clock and a simple redstone torch upper line to control the farm. In my design, if you connect the piston systems by the glazed terracotta, there's one spot that cannot be farmed properly, but changing to the block where is looking at there are no losses. I hope I have explained it well."
0,Keep the well!
0,"17:51
I did not, in fact, know this :)"
0,Awesome video.
0,you could move the desert well over to the other side where you said you need a structure :)
0,etho experiment episode! :D
0,"With each new MC update episode in this series, i'm reminded of 2 things: how much Etho loves this game, and how much i hate amplified world generation (because we get to see it when Etho explores)."
0,"Maybe it’s controversial of me, but I honestly really like the idea of trying to unify your world. Because it’s like a new way of trying to creatively connect a bunch of your buildings and projects together and I’m just a general fan of seeing terraforming and world transformations in Minecraft. Ultimately, I like watching you do what you like to do, and when you don’t enjoy it, I don’t want you doing it. Likewise if you are having fun doing creative projects, it’s fun for me to watch it with you. Keep it up ergo, you’re close to your 600th!"
2,"my god my jaw dropped at the terrain reveal, that terraforming is gorgeous"
0,Etho watches technology connections! Never thought that would be a thing
0,"I say blend the well into the scene. Dilapidate it a little maybe, add some of the new mesa colors encroaching onto the well. Keeps the history while also looking like it belongs and showing a little passage of time."
0,Thanks for the learning reminder ❤ I really enjoy The History of the Universe 's videos - astrophysics is so fun (and quantum physics comes up a lot too)
0,hey etho i have an idea for something you should try to do before episode 600. it would be nice if you finished your stronghold base or atleast the end portal area so it wasnt so messy. I think you could keep everything thats there but build around it. i know its been unfinished for a long time but i think it would be an interesting project and would help the world to feel more complete
0,"I would keep the desert well as a homage to that release.

We received so many different unique mechanics and design elements from that release it's hard to compare."
0,Going to be adding a lot of underground firefly bushes in snow biomes
0,But the real question is..... how did you get the llamas to walk around sandy city like that?🤔
0,I love how you started working on enhancing this little area and the next moment they released EVERY item for it to work better
0,Leaf litter on top of glazed brown terracotta looks really cool!
0,Good Video Etho 👍
0,"Keep the well, but maybe spice it up?"
0,"The red transitional area between mesa and desert looks good, somewhere between a gradient and a mess. It's my first time seeing the new plants, and I find them quite interesting. Especially the dry grass — you could make an awesome, decorative wheat field with it. Good video."
0,"So if I want to start watching this series now, what should i do?"
0,Oh my
0,"Along with other things similar to the desert well, I've always thought you could just update the look by making it a bit dilapidated and fence it off so that we keep the history but it fits in a bit more."
0,It’s always over too soon 😭
0,"Man I had a disagreement with someone not too long ago about the true primary colors and I ended up going down a rabbit hole learning about the primary colors and LEDs, super cool stuff! Would definitely recommend watching a video on the primary colors cause I can’t imagine the full picture is very common knowledge"
0,Keep the history!
0,"boabab style desert trees, or tree dracena (draco)? narrow fence post trees in white/pale wood with gtreen candles as waxy singular leaves?"
0,"Etho, a really artistic blend of colors on the orange Mesa transition! Amazing job with that lighting and color balance. Really has a good vibe. (Unfortunately we humans still have an alternating cycle) mostly magnetism.. I blame the imbalances on house-wiring shifting magnetic fields. But that Mesa blooming.. 😊 real color."
0,I also watched the blue LED video!
0,"For the dithering, you could try adding a line of gravel between the sand and dirt, and the three mixing into each other might help make it a little smoother of a transition"
0,"Wow, don't know when I was this late before"
0,its instant!
0,"I kinda think every plant should be placeable on every natural block or even any block in general. This would give so much freedom for detailing. 

Sure a flower on obsidian wouldn't look good, but thats the decision for the player to make. We can build homes out of sponge, glazed terracotta, and dirt, so why not be able to have ugly plant placement too."
0,You could use the well as an old source of water for one of the custom trees! Then you get to keep the well but also give it some purpose with a custom dry/dying tree for decoration!
0,The well is a part of history. Could be made into a statue or memorial looking thing
0,YOU TOTALLY WATCHED VERITASIUMS VIDEO ON THE BLUE LED
0,"For future building with desert grasses, often grasses also trap sand, creating Dunes, so if you want to break up an area you can create a little sand dune, and put some grasses on it to explain how the dune grew"
0,Convert the desert well into the red sandstone?  That would help it blend in more with the mesa nearby.
0,"about the well, I think if it has history, it overrides the fact that it does not belong 100% with the asthetic but, if you want to remove it and keep the memory, you could move it to another spot and make a lore build, like showing how it was moved somewhere else, idk... Also I think the spontaneous builds in your world, even if everthing is not connected perfectly, its awesome to see and gives a lot of personality"
0,"Hey Etho, why not move the desert well into that corner of desert that needs something? You get to both preserve the history and decorate the space"
0,"This might sound silly, but im proud of your terraforming in this episode, I think you’ve improved even just since that last hermitcraft episode"
0,Fallen trees have been in mjnecraft for years
0,Big numbers are a lot ngl
0,etho my favorite color is orange dont feel bad about people not liking it cause i like it
0,Bedrock had fallen trees for a while love em. Didn't know they weren't in Java till now atleast
0,If you want a decent grasp of entanglement I suggest looking up some videos on the Bell inequality. The experiments show faster than light effects and preserve the rule from relativity that no information can travel faster than light.
0,bdubz forrest in hermit craft needs you to prank him with fireflys hell never see it lol
0,"etho your landscaping has improved by leaps and bounds, the badlands effect with the tuff is amazing"
0,11:00 move the well? It's a hard choice ngl
0,Hi etho🙂‍↕️❤
0,Change up the well? Maybe add a sign in its replacement
0,"Keep the well...or don't, I'm not the Minecraft police. Or am I?"
1,"hey etho! what is ur most recent ""cool thing you learnt""? i love how helpful tour tips are on basically everything! thank you so much!"
0,Relocate the desert well to that corner?
0,"I only watch a video from you every so often. And somehow. The last 3 were all related to the desert.   
HOW. Entirely by chance"
0,I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA TALK ABOUT VERITASIUM
0,"The answer to the quantum entanglement question is this:

Entangled particles (if measured some distance apart), will have entangled outcomes ""instantly"". Partial measurements of one particle that affects the outcome of the other particle also happens ""instantly"".

However, it can't be used to transfer any information, as you have to compare the results of the two measurements to see the effect of the partial measurement (it is perfectly undetectable with only one of the measurements), so if you try to send information with entanglement, you have to send your outcomes, which is still limited by your other methods of sending information, which are all limited by the speed of light (as far as we know).

However, who knows if it's really accurate to say it happens instantly, because simultaneity is a rather nonsense concept in GR. If two events occur at times and places such that nothing could get from one to the other slower than the speed of light, there isn't really a correct answer as to which one of the events occured ""first"", or if they were simultaneous, though we can pick a inertial frame we like and ask which it learns of first."
0,This Dessert/Mesa transition is a perfect example of the great von Sway Style ;-)
0,"Etho! I'm curious about your editing process. When you're putting the video together, what are the first and last things you do editing-wise (i.e. not counting hitting the render button) and how do you like to structure the tracks in your editor?"
0,"You shouldn't destroy the well, it's important to preserve the history of your world, especially considering just how old it is. A slightly ""ugly"" world with history and character is far preferable to a smoothed over ""pretty"" world that's empty of quirks. That said, if you must, slightly moving or modifying the well would be a fine compromise, as it still holds that history even if its form is changed."
0,You have a desert city why not make a snowy city
0,GREAT EPISODE!
0,Keep all history!!!
0,You watched the Veratisium video about blue LED's as well!  🤜🤛 Shared interest!
0,the reason why your world looks good is because it is not one theme.
0,"First time I don't know about an update in advance, I'm so surprised and I love all the new vegetation!"
1,what a gorgeous birch forest
0,"One thing you could do with a lot of your old and random builds is, turn them into historical sites/structures. Give them plaques with a bit of history."
0,"You asked about the well but also earlier about your slanted/curved smelter building. I’ll just say when you first mentioned the building not fitting in I almost had a fit thinking you might possibly redo it and I LOVE it, personally. It’s iconic, it helps me navigate where in your world we are, and I think of it as a snapshot in time of your building prowess.

As for the well, it was a big ol’ meh reaction. Hope that helps!

I always love exploring new updates with you especially as you look for naturally spawned new blocks. So happy you were able to find everything!! 

The firefly bushes are incredible! And they have a very good daytime application to show allergy season xD Pollen floating in the air!!"
0,do a custom mesa well in place of the desert well

0,I watch Etho therefore I am
1,Don’t tell Etho that Bdubs’ mountains are hollow
0,How did you get the llamas to walk around Sandy City like that?
0,"I don't think speed of light has a constant. It's just theoretical that IF there'd be nothing then light would travel at that distance.
Have you ever proved that there's NOTHING in any given place? I have! There's no basis for that theory! X D"
1,"I love the colors of the Mesa addition! Orange sandstone, maroon, dark gray, brown, and evergreen looks amazing together, especially next to the pale sand ❤️"
0,"I wonder if you could use a lot of the firefly bushes underneath a desert to create a sandstorm effect? They might not create enough particles, but with the redstone control option you could create small random wind gusts possibly, that could even roll across an area with time. I’ve never used them so idk, but was a thought I had when seeing the particle effect."
0,Why not transform a couple of mountains to mesa instead of destroying the desert?
0,❤
0,Oof I'd much prefer just desert
0,Unexpected Food Science mention hell yeah
0,I would move the well to the location where you felt it needs a build. That way your terraforming gets the feel it needs and that spot too.
1,buildings dont have to blend innnn blending in is so boring
1,"Overall, I like the terraforming, but it's just a little to busy/messy looking"
0,"What is the green thing between the ""you've been Etho'd"" and the ""super storage""?"

0,"Don't you touch that well, Etho."
0,"Just learned about quantum calculators on my cyber security course, and I would say your assessment is very accurate :D
And definitely keep the well! It's a little piece of etho history. Maybe you could find some way to blend it into the surroundings?"
0,"Etho, your world does have a theme, its a theme of nostalgia and memories. While it does not match or blend it when you amass alot of that it becomes it own theme. I honestly love it, it reminds me of when i used play minecraft daily in high school. It has its own charm and i think most of the community will agree that makes its wonderful and beautiful."
0,my aunt and uncle areoving to canada! be nice to them up there hahah
0,Wow good job
0,"As someone who got killed by the well, I think it should stay! It could be moved a bit further back or even if there’s a little corner in Sandy City it could be tucked in nice to still be around, and trap people. Also a birch button instead may make it more effective as a trap"
0,"Does this break cactus farms?  Since the flowers don't pop off, eventually the classic cactus farm is going to have a flower on top of all of them, instead of growing a cactus to pop off?"
2,"26:16 Brooooo this is the 3rd time I heard someone mention fallen trees being new, I’ve seen them all the time?? They’ve been in the game forever?? 🤔🤔🤔🤔"
0,"Since cactus can grow a flower at the first level, is that going to break most cactus farms as eventually all cacti will be one tall with a flower?"
0,"at this point... id love a world restart, if only just to get more videos ...>.> i miss watching my weekly etho plays. and it seems this world has lost its pizzazz"
0,"You said we were going to do your favorite thing this episode.. then I proceeded to watch the episode til the end. I thought cooking with etho was your favorite thing 🤔

Keep the well, make it orange sand instead. Use the bushes under the corners to get the firefly effect.

Put leaves on the water in the well (if possible) do the leaves work on top of bubble columns. If so maybe a sneaky secret farm under the well to farm these new blocks and items"
0,"Keep the well in the world, but it doesn't need to stay where it is."
0,"9:30  absolutely shocked to see that etho could terraform this well . I'll be honest I kinda expected it to be not so good at the start but completely shocked me , more reason to never underestimate etho"
0,17:49 nahh etho just discovered something nobody knew about! 😮😮 That's so cool
0,keep the well... if you're struggling to make it work make it look like some dessert wind has blown through and buried it partially
0,"Your description might be a little off, version 1.21.1, isn't it 1.21.5?"
0,Ergo pls play vintage story

0,"I like the idea of a bit of mesa treatment at the edge of the desert....  but then I'd want to move the lava pond over there...  or maybe the well could go into the area you are thinking of making that little farm.  Removing the well would just feel wrong, but moving it would be okay.  Or perhaps the lava pit might work over there."
0,"When I was young, studying english, instead writing Desert, I wrote Dessert. The teacher was not impressed by that mistake."
0,i like worlds with no big theme way more. it’s more creative and interesting and innovative in my opinion and also very classic minecraft
0,"etho, having no theme is a theme in itself! i say keep the well!"
0,34:29 veritasium reference?
0,"the well could go in my opinion, but I'm seeing people like it, so I'm in the minority I think! what you could do is add some detailing to make it fit in more!"

0,Entanglement is instant :)
0,I feel the peace within your voice. thank you so much for the video man you help a lot
0,"34:41 as someone who is majoring in food science, I feel noticed lol"
0,Id keep the well!
0,"8:00 ish, I think the badlands area looks great! but it's uhh a bit over-decorated, relative to the surrounding area"
0,"Yea I never seen moss on water either but it does make me feel like we should do more with lakes. People treat them like swimming pools, flat plane of blue."
0,The count down to episode 600 is going strong
0,"You should keep the well and maybe make a little “trader like outpost” a bit of straw/hay some trading tables and rest spots, mini stables 

Also I don’t think a theme is needed in all worlds especially one aslong as yours where everything would start blending in too much :)

And I really like the idea of blending things in by terraforming over changing or removing the structure, worst case move it or per possible add more similar stuff to the initial thing around it to make it look like it belongs more

I also really like how it all turned out it’s amazing

Also the fallen trees have been in bedrock for years mwhahahaha ;)
I also wanna add the firefly bushes under my enchantment table for e different mix of particles"
0,Don't you get rid of that well! I'm already devastated from the lava pool being removed..
0,Do not remove the desert well!
0,"Regards to keeping the well. I think you should keep it, but add your own flair to it and have it match the surroundings. Then it’s still there, but doesn’t stand out."
1,"I say keep the well! What's the point of the place being beautiful if we gotta tear down such funny history to make it so

Edit: Hey I'm in college trying to become quantum physics-adjacent (nuclear)! maybe someday i'll have a better answer for you, just a freshman right now, but for now I think quantum entanglement is like knowing that two packages have a pair of shoes between them. If you open one and see that it has a left shoe, you then instantly know that the other one must contain a right shoe, no matter how far you are from the package! Just swap the shoes for particle spins and stuff. This may seem pretty obvious, but i think the reason it's generally thought of as a weird spooky quantum thing is because the wavefunction for both particles seemingly collapses at the same time, since before you measure either one they are in a superposition, but after you know the state of both, meaning both wavefunctions had to have collapsed instantly across however far you are from the other ""shoe."" This probably isn't useful for breaking the speed of light since you can't really tell if a wave function's been collapsed from the outside or anything like that, so you can't send information instantly and thus don't violate General Relativity or go faster than the speed of light, but who knows, maybe someday we'll figure something out with it! I think we already use it for quantum computing coherence stuff, just not its ""faster than light"" stuff."
0,"Hey etho. I know we all have that getting started barrier creatively. You can try using AI tools for that, just take a screenshot of your world and ask the AI to fill in something just to get a bigger picture. No idea how good it works but hope you find it helpful."
0,I think the area you mention to have a structure in the new desert area to the left (30:39) should be a stable with some camels

0,"Hey Etho I wanted to ask what is a project in your world that you believe lead to large change in the game or a really different new perspective on how to play the game that most people don’t know about, or has been overlooked?"
0,i am inlove with the mesa addition
0,see ya in a month
2,"I got so excited when you mentioned you like food science. I would love to hear more about some of your favorite concepts. My favorites are all about heat transfer; from sous vide, to resting meats, to sugar or salt content effecting boiling points and beyond. One of the coolest ones I learned from a combi oven demo was that they use steam injection to get a better ""fried food"" effect than a normal convection oven. It seems counter-intuitive because you would think water in the air would inhibit browning/crispy textures. What blew my mind is that this is only a factor if you allow condensation to occur. They cycle the air so efficiently that condensation is minimized, and the heat density of the air is way higher with a high humidity so its just quicker and more effective. So freaking cool."
0,"Hey Etho, I've been watching your videos for over 12 years! For half my life now these videos have entertained me, and brought a smile to my face when I was feeling down. I just want to say thank you. :)"
0,"im only at 15:57 where he's yippee-ing about it being placed on any block but i can't wait to see him realise (that unless this changed in the prereleases, in which case i will be mad) it ONLY needs a center block support - you can put them on fence bars and end rods and singular glass panes. this REALLY opens it up to being useful in loads of places, especially in water"

0,I have had a very bad day today. This was a nice surprise and a good way to relax from it for a while. Thank you for choosing today to upload!
0,"The terraforming you did kind of reminds me of the area here in Moab! If you added some plateaus, arches, or even a canyon it'd look just like Arches National Park. Love your videos Etho!"
0,keep the well but decorate it!
0,"at the end I feel like that corner area would be perfect for a town bathing and laundry area, with a small pond. Been playing Kingdome Come Deliverance 2 and I immediately thought it felt like the small town laundry areas you go to around the map."
0,You could add something or modify the well so it fits better.
0,"I really appreciate how etho always encourages us to learn, probably my favorite thing about his videos"
0,"Etho, I want to hear about your thoughts on food science."
0,"not sure if it's intentional, but the red sand building makeover creates an abandoned building kinda vibe which seems very fitting given there's no functionality anymore"
0,Hi etho thanks for the upload ❤
1,"Keep the desert well. It makes it feel like history of Minecraft, and your world, and it’s a bit of a call back to the old guard that remembers Minecraft before they came out, and how cool structures in the dessert first were"
0,Keep the well please!
0,"I'm totally impressed with your mesa Esque terraforming! also, keep the desert well!"
0,"I've been going through your entire let's play, and this video was particularly fun because I'm currently at the point where the pyramid and Sandy City are in its early stages. Very nice to see you still working on old projects and improving your world step by step!

However, don't say you haven't done some terraforming in your world! The biome enhancement project has made your world so much nicer already. I do look forward to seeing what your new skills in terraforming do to your world. It's at least off to a great start :)"
0,"I must admit, I ABSOLUTELY fell for all the traps in your world downloads back in the day. I totally forgot about them until you brought it up lol"
0,Honestly the mesa-fication turned out way better than I thought it would. I think the red may be a bit unnecessary but you blended it all well.
0,"On a different note, this was one of my favorite episodes in a while. Spending a lot of time learning the mechanics of a new feature reminded me a lot of the old days when you'd dedicate time to that every time there was an update. That's why I fell in love with this series - very fun!"
0,You have to keep the well. It killed me once. The way my jaw was on the floor..
1,"First thought when I saw the reveal, after you showed the wall, and befofe you got any of the update stuff… I straight up said wow, that looks really good! Cause it does!! Good job etho!"
0,"Now that you’ve mentioned it, I think the next world download should definitely include a novel way to kill the player :)"
0,"I think the new area is a little bit too cluttered, at least when it's directly next to the very plain sand. I think if you extend the mesa-like section across that whole area and up to the wall it'll help a lot to make it not stick out so badly. Alternatively, tone down the vegetation along the transition a bit I think"
0,Good to know Etho is a Veritasium enjoyer also.
0,"Etho, you should consider making a custom Ponderosa forest to help blend your mesa, desert, and forest. 
I worked as a backpacking guide in the badlands of the southwest US and ponderosa pine forests were definitely my favorite part. A healthy ponderosa forest should allow people to ride a horse full gallop through it and it smells like butterscotch, would be a cool thing to represent."
1,#Etho keep the well!!
0,"Etho and Bdubs and Scar uploads, all on the same day? Wahoo!

Nice plan for the day, taking a break to spruce things up... And ohhh, I'm so glad you didn't take that converter building down heh... Not only does it look so cool (I mean, I think so anyway!) but it's part of the history of the world, and idk, there's something comforting and orienting about keeping those things around. So I guess re the Well, I'd vote to keep it too, but I also think it's fine to fancy up an old structure or change some blocks... It just becomes more layers of history :) As a viewer I quite like being able to look at a thing and remember how it came to be and the changes it's gone through. (That all said, it is *your* creative space, and ultimately I'd rather you do whatever makes you happy!)

I love the way you're branching out with your terraforming and so on, trying out new things etc. And that mesa-esque biome looks awesome, it'll be cool to see it spread out some more! I do agree that the dry grass'll look better with it being in patches vs evenly scattered. And I had the same thought about dry leaves being blown up against walls! It's so great, the things they're giving us to work with.

Thanks for the episode! Now how to go about fixing my massive cactus-powered XP factory... Maybe it's just a part of history now, haha x)"
1,"I like you keeping old builds even if they're non functional or kinda ugly by today's standards. I think if you don't want the trap well in its current spot, i think moving it to the spot at 30:42 could be nice. Also I think it would be cool to add little landmark signs like you see in real life on preserved buildings that explain the original purpose of the building or structure, could be fun to make some dramatized explanations for old builds. For the sand converter something like ""we believe this ancient monument was built by an alchemist, who in his time believed it possible to transmute sand between its different forms"" you could also have a small simplified example build of the mechanism showing like ""yellow sand + piston = red sand"" in a pictrographic way."
0,That orange slice of a building looked most befitting to me. Like it was a lone shop that stuck out and sold orange juice
0,34:38 omg i get it now you are the reason i became an engineer 💀😭😭😭
0,"Hey Etho, keep the well! I beleive that you are one of the OG players in the games entire history and seeing you be able to keep history in your world and use it as a memento to all the time that has passed and how far you've come."
0,Remove the well
0,"If you so much as touch that well i am rioting

😁"
12,"I don’t think you need to worry about your world being a bit of a mod podge instead of a super planned out cohesive world. You’re probably one of the only LPs who still predominantly plays in the old days’ building philosophy, and it is extremely charming. Ironically, it also makes you stand out from all the other new forever world LPs that come out every day."

0,i saw a theory that just came out saying that our universe could have been formed in a black hole which if that is the case also theorizes we are in an even bigger universe 😳
0,"i'd be fine with you tearing down the desert well personally. while i get wanting to hold onto for history, given that it was mainly made for a joke i think it's fine to let it go. i'm sure that it got some people back when you added it, and so it can be said that it served it's purpose. art is ephemeral, not permanent!"
0,"For the sandstone well, if you aren't opposed to just a small retouch, make the blocks more like the red sandstone area behind it. I think that would be the best option. Keep some sandstone to keep the original style but add some red sandstone/sand as a small accent. Then you keep the deathtrap AND help further tie in the sandy village to the red ex sand farm :) that would be my vote BUT if that's too much then just keep the sandstone well as is :)"
0,"9:17 as a southern california local, this little desert revamp really feels really realistic to me. i mean most deserts have a hell of a lot more life in them than the typical barren waste you see in a lot of pop culture. this little path absolutely feels like somewhere i'd go hiking"
0,"Hey Etho, Just a thought but why not move the well into the corner instead of building a farm for the new grass?

Grass farm may be more useful but visually the well might look better there while still being preserved"
0,"So are classic cactus farms broken now? If a flower grows before a two tall, the farm just fizzles out?"
0,"Hiya Etho! I like the new items for biomes. I want to thank you for encouraging everyone to continue self education too! Maybe surprise everyone with adding a new suprise well? It's a pleasure to enjoy this series, thank you! <3 ~respect"
0,"I think it'd be super neat if you could compost those new dry grasses into sand blocks so you can make big sand farms, maybe then we would get rid of tnt dupers?"
0,"I think you should keep the well, but maybe move it over to that corner of the wall that you said needed a structure. that way you keep the history of the world but it doesn't distract from the terrain."
0,"First and foremost, YAY! Efo has uploaded! Second, I think your terraforming skills are coming along great! You'll be teaching Bdubs how to do it in no time."
0,"Hey Etho, long time viewer first time commenter. I was wondering if when you made Sandy City did you think that it would continue to spark creativity for you so many years later."
0,"I think the desert well can go. You're right it won't fit into the area. You could try moving it somewhere else too. 

I cannot wait to see what you do with the new update! These decorative blocks are a game changer! I hope they add green and fall colored leaf piles with their respective seasonal updates."
0,I’m studying Ontology on YouTube and it is the most difficult thing in the world.
0,"I think better than the wall is extending the desert to the water and around the piramid, because when you are flying the transition still looks very rough. Other than that I really enjoyed the video!"
0,"Hi Etho, long time fan here, I've really enjoyed all of your content but i find myself rewatching your CTM lets plays every so often and i always forget what's going to happen since its been so long. i know you said you couldn't play Vech's nightmare realm as a lets play because you've seen somebody else's, but if enough time has past and you don't remember a lot of it would you consider it? i know very niche question but would make my year lol."
0,"Maybe spruce the well up a bit, but don’t get rid of it"
0,Thanks etho!
0,Leave the desert well.
0,"I'm guessing the blue LED video is the one from Veritasium. I highly recommend watching it, it's a very interesting video!"
0,Move the desert well into the small corner spot
0,"This sounds tedious to do, but I think it'd be neat if you had fireflies in the man cave during night time, with daylight sensors to turn them off during the day time."

0,"Etho, you mentioned in previous world tour videos that the recording process puts strain on your voice, have you considered breaking up the recording into sections to give yourself a break? e.g mancave, then the surface around the mancave, then the nether, etc., with each recording done on a different day."
2,I love your process of discovering new mechanics in the game. Very thorough and scientific in its manner. Keep it up brotha!

0,I think you could relocate the well to somewhere it'll look nicer.
0,"The new desert grass looks like wheat, a least a new variation"
0,"I love this. I especially love how excited you are by the new plants. Question: do you keep plants or a garden? If so, what are some of your personal favorites? Bonus: why do all my pothos do great and then die? I don't think I am overwatering."
0,"If you don't like the well, take it out, its your world first, then ours :) but if you need a structure in the other area, you could also just relocate the well over there."
0,I feel like we need a museum for old builds or just random buildings that have to get demolished for one reason or another. That way you don't have to feel bad getting rid of something that doesn't fit anymore

1,Leave the desert well!!
1,hey Etho! I have been on the search for Etho  merch for a long time now. ive been watching you for 10 or more years now and would love to get something to put on a car or water bottle. Do you ever want to make your own merch? and does it bother you that other people sell stuff of your likeness?
1,"Quantum physics gets really bad in popular media because it simultaneously has a lot of really crazy results that are mind blowing, but is also _really_ hard to understand. So scientists will give shortened explanations, and then ppl will just spread the shortened explanation like wildfire and then nothing makes any sense.

Also, one of my favorite QM misconceptions: people often explain superposition using schrodinger's cat.... when schrodinger's cat was literally thought up as a thought experiment to demonstrate how crazy the results of QM were. (ofc, superposition really is a thing that makes sense within QM, but it's just genuinely something that takes a lot to wrap your head around)"
2,"2:00 dont blend everything to ""fit"", also 11:20 KEEP THE WELL
The history of it is cool in of itself because its been there forever, but also one of hte unique things here is that there are parts reminiscent of older minecraft styles. one of hte big separators between your world and most others IS that you have all this history with old builds; no matter how much ""objectively"" better it would be to smooth everything out to flow easier, its a style in of itself to have a sort of ""jumble"" of builds to a degree (every youtuber has a dozen giant fancy builds/areas in their worlds, so its not necessarily that interesting to see another world full of nothing but that same style)"
1,"Of course they had a ""fast turnaround"" on the spring drop.  90% of it was already out before the Minecraft Misnomer came out, so what would possibly have taken much time?  The only things that were new by that point were dry ghasts and the shaders, both of which were clearly done by the time they announced them!"

1,Etho watched veritasium confirmed
1,Keep the desert well!
1,You could make the well into red sandstone if you wanted it to blend a little better
12,"Hey Ergo, I just wanted to say that I started watching you in middle school and I am now a Quantum Physicist, the wave function can collapse when looking at of of the entangled states and then it ""instantly"" collapses the other, But the important thing here is that the information is not traveling faster than the speed of light because the information of what state the first entangled particle is would need to travel to the location of the second to be of any use and thus must travel though a classical channel and travel at the speed of light 

If you have a pair of gloves and put them in two boxes and then move the boxes far apart. Open one box and see you have the left glove that must mean the right glove is in the other box ""instantly"" however to tell the person that they have the right glove you would need to tell them though ways that must be slower than the speed of light  Notes: the gloves are predetermined when you put them in the box and not actually in a superposition state, but its just a close analogy"
293,"1:47 Regarding the missing ""theme"" in the world or I guess it not being unified:
I'll say it would definitely be possible to blend things a bit together, as in that they don't randomly appear like they do there. But honestly speaking, I watch you now for...13 years? I only recall someone mentioned on Monkeyfarms video that him and you were the best builders. I checked you out, didn't like there is no texture pack and left, but some video caught my eye (I think it was Episode 110 where you build a cow fishing farm and yes I extra looked that up now). Rambling aside, one thing that has been consistent is that nothing feels too tied together. Like yes, the things have a use, even if the use is just looks or having fun, but since they aren't that connected it feels like a new adventure when something new is build. If there was only the man cave then yea it'd be still a ton of fun to expand and change it, but a new farm attached to it would also just be another part in the big cave. One of my favorite buildings were the amplified mountain village and the episode where IIRC you exploded all of it with TNT. This is so random but also just felt like visiting a new dimension within the same world.
So yea, I do get the complaint about it when building now, it probably feels a bit limiting and no matter how good it looks, there is something in the back sticking out, but it gives a unique feeling to the let's play."
4,"I really like that terraforming palette! I also love that there are desert plants in the mix (the mangrove stuff) 
The leaf litters are kinda satisfying. Like the cherry flowers, I just throw a bunch on the ground without planning anything and it makes everything feel better somehow.
Update: ok, the firefly bush is my new favorite thing now."
2,It looks amazing ego!
1,I want to now what ethos thoughts on what mumbo  is doimg with fans...  there so cool.  Id love to see a etho take on it
1,I wonder if you could have a cactus block on a sticky piston and then a detector for when the flower grows. Retract the piston with the cactus block on it to pop off the flower and put it back again. It's also been a decade since I've played the game so no idea if that would work or not.
1,Did you mean to write 1.21.5 in the description?
1,"I don't keep up to date with the minecraft updates, so I saw this video and thought ""Oooh, new Etho vid- wait, the what?""
Guess I gotta go boot up my pc lol"
1,Never destroy a build
2,"Thank goodness, i needed some etho time today. Its been such a rough day, just need some time to relax"
1,Great video as always Etho!
1,i love your work and sharing your persona with anecdotes and creativity
1,How did you get the llamas to stop walking around sandy city?
1,"These are my favorite types of vides of Etho's just watching him decroate and experiment. discuss his thoughts, im no good at redstone so its lovely to see him improve things and chat!"
1,Decorate the well!!!!
1,I wonder if your old recreated cactus farm is producing any cactus flowers already
1,etho...its time...new world...come on man.
1,"So I say remove the desert well, you built it so you can move it if necessary. Also it sorta gets in the way with the new terraforming."
1,dont think i liked the mesa. Its too over reaching. I liked the simple and plain the yellow desert
1,Don’t tear down the well :)
1,Should add layers of terracotta to the hill behind the building like a badlands biome
1,Dr. Becky Smethurst is always a good watch.
1,Wow!  Really like the mesa and desert blending!
1,With the random plants I would make a path through them where there are not plants. Either a foot path or an animal path. You may even put some sand stone down in places if you want it to look well used and trodden.
1,Keep the well on the far side from the sand building add the floor design from a desert pyramid
1,The description says 1.21.1 instead of 1.21.5 🙃
1,"1.21.5 made several changes to bubble columns. I think the fix of bug MC-261385 caused the villagers to get stuck. This fixed a bug that made bubble columns with nonsolid blocks above them (such as a fence gate) not launch entities as fast. So you were right, that bubble column is pushing the villagers up more than before."
1,"What if the desert well was transformed into a bit of a ruin, as if we pressed the button 😁"
2,So close to episode 600! Maybe we'll get it before 2030 😁
2,"Man I have been watching etho’s lets play world for so long that I will be going to college before this series ends

Thank you for being my childhood Etho"
1,34:47 did Etho just say quantum mcphysics? Is he perhaps a fellow Philomena Cunk enjoyer?
1,etho are you gonna watch the minecraft movie!
1,The orange sandstone area gives me boarderlands vibes
2,Etho! The moss carpet on water isn't unique to moss. You can do it with all carpets!
1,The blue led video is probably the one that Veritasium made. That channel and Cool Worlds are two that I can easily recommend!
1,"I think the old desert well needs to move, but shouldn’t be forgotten. Maybe it can have a second life as the skin of your desert grass farm"
1,34:23 That was one of the first videos I ever watched from Veritasium. I've been hooked ever since!
4,"In love with the mesa, I love that the layers look like rock strata. I think the walls between biomes make the desert look sort of man-made. What I would do is make the new mesa branch off into the transition, and keep that theme consistent around the perimeter of the desert on that side. So just put tuff, red clay etc. in the ground, perhaps in the same vertical sequence to keep within geological parameters."
1,"The terraforming looks so nice! I actually love Red Sand and Red Sandstone, so I really enjoyed seeing it used."
2,"The bushes could make a great environment for a snow village. Perpetual soft falling snow. Love the watermelon cacti, definitely stealing that one for my world. Thanks!"
1,i wonder what foodscience say about onions :D
1,"Hello Etho! I was wondering what (kinds of) videos do you watch in the background whilst you're building?

P.S. You gotta keep the desert well. I fell for your trap many years ago."
1,For the desert well you should relocate it
1,"Etho, are the llamas still walking around the sandy city? The people need to know"
1,"Keep the well 100%. that being said, i do agree it looks really odd in its position, and its so small, id honestly just move it to another part of the desert. maybe in the middle of the sugar cane farm? Idk, i do think it should stay somewhere though. Those red sand cliffs look amazing too, it may be worth the effort to expand the area it covers even more too. it looks that good, my biggest problem with red sand is so few pallets blend well with it, resorting to almost exclusively high contrast builds. but here it works amazing."
1,keep the well
1,DONT TOUCH THE WELL
1,I think it wouldn’t really be removing the history if you kept the well but just moved it to a better location. That just becomes part of the new history
1,Your desert area looks so good! Your terraforming mixed with the new plants makes it so immersive
30,"I think ""It might be too chaotic, I""m not sure"" is *exactly* where you want your nature builds to be. absolutely gorgeous detailing and great variety but structured just enough to flow together without feeling artificial"
0,The leaves kinda look like foot steps a bit
0,I watched the same blue LED video I think. My favorite part is that red + green + blue light = white!  RGB!  If you mix those in paint you get vomit.
0,"Ok so now that we’re no longer fishing all the time, I see terraforming is the new subject to learn. Excellent because mine sucks and maybe I can actually learn something. 

Always makes my day when I see a new upload. And a BDubs today too? Sweet!"
1,I love stuff shown off at 8:00. Keep the well!
2,19:02 I see what you're laying down.
2,"Hey Etho I just wanted to drop a comment to say thank you. I’ve been watching for maybe a little over 10 years now and you’re always someone I can watch to just relax and take a break, so thank you again."
1,"Hey Etho, do you like candy corn? I love it, but some of my friends think it's nasty. Surely they're wrong?"
2,"1:46 If anyone tells you that it is ""unfortunate"" that your world does not have one unifying theme, I think they're being a bit toxic. Minecraft is a game about expressing yourself! If that means building the perfect fantasy world where everything fits perfectly together, then that's great! But to me, I'd find that a bit alienating from the way that I enjoy the game."
1,Brother you started Sandy City 10 YEARS AGO! EPISODE 389 WDYM LETS FINISH IT BEFORE EPISODE 600
1,"So you can actually put the cactus flower on bamboo, but only if the bamboo position happens to be close enough to center. I did some testing -- check my comment on the r/minecraft post ""**Uncommon décor combo due to bamboo being randomly offset. Only a centered cane allows you to place Cactus Flower atop**"" -- and it's about 1.55% of all possible bamboo positions globally"
1,etho do you watch adam ragusea?
1,11:09 that well have killed me before... 😂
24,"Hey Etho, how did you get the llamas to walk around sandy city without them wandering off?"
1,"Love the episode, Etho"
1,Maybe you could move the lava well to that spot at 30:38
2,I watched the video on the blue LED a few months ago! Such a shame that he never got the credit he deserved after putting so much work into finding the solution. Building your own machines to create something you don't know is possible is a lot of work!
2,"Didn't throw diamonds in the lava before removing it.... I'm not angry, just disappointed."
2,10:51 I definitely agree that the well should stay but it could be improved with some decoration. It might be neat to copy over some of the dark prismarine from the other build or make it look old and overgrown.
1,Please do another world tour on episode 600
1,Sometime building should be outstanding from other to make feeling that it is real.
1,"Man going around Sandy City the desert area is really shaping up. But I'm gonna be honest, I can't focus on it cause I'm too busy wondering how he got the llamas to walk around like that!"
1,"Oh, no, Etho is turning into a modern builder!"
1,Sandy city is my favorite project in this world.
1,the mini mesa biome looks amazing! i love the details and block choices!
2,Please don’t tear down the well.
3,I see Etho is as punctual with his Veritasium videos as he is with his finishing his Hermitcraft projects
1,"love the terraforming, but all the plant life feels a bit too cluttered. you may want to get rid of some of them. loved the episode!"
1,You need to build on those old mountains mr Etho!
1,keep it but blend the colors
0,"Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism"
1,"I think you should give the desert well a visual overhaul. It doesn't need a big structural change, just a bit more variety in block-choice."
0,I can't unsee the leaf litter on sand as a kitty litter box
1,"moving the well to where you said might need a structure near the end of the video could be a good idea, to remove it from where it's ugly but keep it still."
0,so casually Ehto made an quantum cactus solver machine
0,I don’t think the well makes the area ugly - I think a big appeal of lets plays like this is the history of the world and all the little things like that well that make it unique
0,Move the well to another location using the exact same blocks
0,Plz don't get rid of the jungle trees next to the pyramid.
0,"Keep the well, those memories are important! :) I agree with the other commenters though, find a way to blend it into the immediate environment? Or even better, maybe make your own version, and then edit the old well to look a little more decrepit/aged?"
0,"Everytime i watch an Etho video it just reminds me how hes definitely Canadian bc he talks like a Canadian, because he talks like my dad, and my dad is Canadian, farm raised and all, its a bit surreal lol"
0,Interesting comment of the day woo
0,"From what I've heard, if you think you understand quantum physics, you probably don't really. Also really hoping you find some of the new animal variants at some point. I forget, did you ever find an ancient city?"
0,Love the red sand additions!! So vibrant
0,I've been watching your videos for over 10 years and it's still one of the most exciting and relaxing things to see a new release from you
0,i missed you etho a lot
0,Those mountains by sandy city are my favorite type of terrain that MC ever had!
0,its instant.  there is no travel as they are `connected`
0,"I say keep the well, maybe spruce it up or even run it down like an old unused well that the town just leaves and maybe fences off rather than removes"
48,"Its nice to know that I'm not alone with obsessively researching random subjects and watching science Youtube for entertainment. I've gotten deep into so many miscellaneous subjects completely be accident. You never know when some obscure bit of knowledge will prove useful, and even if it doesn't its just so fun to be able to observe natural phenomena and understand what is going on. I also love all the obscure plant knowledge like cacti being edible (though do watch out for oxalate crystals, not all cacti are worth snacking on), its so nice to know that Etho actually appreciates botany, its super underrated."
0,😊 I love the new badlands terrain. It looks awesome!
0,"For those mountains near your base- would you ever want to add a little NPC style village? with little snowy houses, shops, and other things? I know it's more for decoration than function, so not sure if it's your style"
0,"there's a video that i think you might enjoy, ""Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists"" by Microsoft. i found it super interesting, being a programmer myself."
0,Pre-comment prediction: he’s gonna say many worlds is his favorite interpretation.
0,Keep that well Etho!
0,Omg its a bush? Keralis must be losing it lmfao
0,My YouTube runs at 480p (cause my internet is bad). But! that makes the transition between the yellow and red sand look really cool.
0,yessssss
0,The cactus and cactus flower launching across the desert had me laugh out loud. Something about it was just so comedic
0,Keep the well but maybe move it a little bit to be more of a centerpiece. Maybe even add some flourish around it?
0,"The cactus flower on a lightning rod looks like a feather duster. Could go in like a supply closet, would make a nice detail"
0,"You should keep the well, it's too iconic to be demolished"
0,"obvs keep the well, thanks ergo <3"
0,"Please please pleeeese keep the well!
It's too nostalgic for you to remove.
That and Spaz's house killed me. 😆"
0,"i thought fallen trees have been a thing, i definitely remember them in some of my worlds throughout the years. were they bedrock only or something? weird, but theyre so cool!"
1,The well's well
0,"I'd say get rid of the well, it just doesn't fit there anymore. It obscures the view and it's too bright when it's dark out. The argument it's history and been there for years goes for every block, you haven't touched, out there."
1,Get ur snax
0,The contrast between the sand and the forest is natural. Don't forget about the Athabaska sand dunes.
0,"Loved your take on quantum physics! I totally agree with what you said and think a lot of what gets spread around is the stuff that seems interesting and not necessarily what is true. Everyone wants to have their perception of the world shattered by something seemingly impossible but I think the physics of the KNOWN universe are crazy enough for a hundred lifetimes. I still am excited about the research and don't think it should stop, but I don't see teleporters or anything else coming out of it. It will probably just help us better understand what we already know and to do it better and more efficiently."
0,That red desert is beautiful
0,you would do well to keep it
0,Do not remove the well!
0,17:47 WHAT???
0,maybe move the well slightly but defintely dont get rid of it
207,11:00 the well is here to stay! There needs to be some relics of the past.
0,Make a tribute to the desert well. A spiritual successor that’s better
0,I'd make the well into a ruin itself so that it keeps some record of it once being there but gets transformed into something that fits in well (no pun intended).
1,"I just thought of something. Dessert have fatamorgana right? I think its possible to make that using shulker? Like maybe water or blue glass, and cover it with sandy colored shulker so from afar it looks like water, but once you get close it's just land😮 but I don't know if there's sand colored shulker"
0,You must like Technology Connections.
0,"I think the corner at 30:40 would be an excellent space for some camels to rest. Its a little closed off by terrain, its outside of the main city (where they are usually held) and a River is close by. That‘d be optimal"
0,"Thank you for your videos. I've been feeling like YouTube is no longer as good as it used to be, it's nice to have a channel that's just good content without clickbait."
1,"man etho, i started watching you when you started the man-cave and i gotta say, you dont need to copy the status quo and make everything uniform or purposeful. things can be spur of the moment and fun. it was your unique style and approach to things that drew me in all those years ago. dont conform, be you"
0,GET THE POPCORN ITS ETHO TIME RAHHHH
0,Love me a polishing video with tips and tricks by the Master! Promoting education is much appreciated. Something our society needs more of. Thx! A credible source is crucial to objective learning and the ability to ask reasoned questions.❤
1388,"Etho, don't fall prey to the modern Youtube tendencies of optimizing your content to be just aesthetically ideal and focused on showing results. We like the quirkiness of your world and how you build things, and it would be sad to lose that just for the sake of slightly better looking builds and quick gratification. There are a million other channels that do that. I've noticed you ever so slightly trending in this direction, so I just want to go out there and say, stick to your roots! Your style is a rare gem on Youtube these days."
0,"I would move the well to the corner where you want to add a structure, keep the history of the structure and clear out the main desert at the same time."
0,Leave the desert well
0,how about using a little bit of orange concrete powder to soften the red sand a bit?
0,"Would you be able to salvage the well by making it worn to time, overgrown with plant life and broken down"
1,"Etho, 
I have been watching for years and have a question because I remember you enjoyed Tera Firma Craft. Would you ever try Vintage Story? It is very similar to that old mod, but has its own challenges to it."
0,Dry grass plus Haybales would be amazing
0,Would stripped oak/birch help blend between the tuff/dirt and the original sand?
0,"hey sandy-city!

How did you make the Etho go around the Llama like that? 

(this joke is sooooooo old..)"
0,"To fill in those mountains, why don't you try building a Dwarvish city/keep? Its right up your alley (I know this concept was tested in Hermitcraft season 3...) and would look super cool and thematic. Plus, no need to build too many roofs!"
0,The Firefly effects remind me of the Twilight Forest Mod
0,I personally think you should either get rid of or move the well to inside sandy city. Sometimes we like to keep onto things for the memory even though we don’t actually look after or appreciate them any more. At that point it’s better to move on and make good use of the space.
0,And a let’s play episode at that 🥲
0,"Ehi Etho, have you ever thought about pruning your world from far away chunks you don't explore often? Since chunk borders are no longer an issue?"
0,Eeeeethoooooo!!!! Thank you!!! What a present surprise I was really not expecting an upload!!
0,Keep the desert well! I think the desert grass helps blend the structure in better.
0,I'd say leave the well.
0,"In relation to the comment of the day, you should check out the 99% invisible podcast. Every time I listen to them I’m so fascinated. I listened to one recently where they talk about cargo ships that are abandoned by their company due to high port costs. The problem is that they then won’t pay the cargo ships crew if they leave the ship, forcing them to stay on board for months or years until the issue is resolved."
0,"Hey etho, how'd you get the llamas to walk around Sandy City (tm) like that?"
0,I think you should just built a new lava fountain but in your own style honors the past but looks nice
0,I really like the sea pickles as barrel cactus and really enjoyed this episode.
0,"Yeah boys, we're on the final stretch for the next world tour. Looking forward to seeing that cactus flower farm."
0,"Etho, could you talk a bit about your thoughts on starting a new world? What would make you want to, do you think you ever will?"
0,Found out my wife was pregnant this morning and Etho uploads a video! What an amazing day today has been
0,"I'd say keep the well, but you can shrink it using thinner blocks while also keeping the killing function intact"
0,"As a physics major... quantum mechanics is definitely very theory based and the class I took on it was very much about the math. The only thing that can be shown from QM is the double slit experiment. Everything else in class was largely based on the mathematics and calculus II and III (integration and multivariable calculus). It's a cliche to say it, but if you think you understand QM you probably don't."
0,"Hi Etho! I think it's cool how a lot of biomes around your main area are close together. A theme that you could go for is containing the different biomes in certain areas (maybe the mountains could be made taller which could also be a good way to learn terraforming).
Kind of like Terraria where you have to contain the crimson or corruption from spreading. You could experiment with different biome blending techniques and such!"
0,Can’t believe that didn’t end with a sponsorship for Brilliant 😂
0,"Teetho, how did you get the [Tall Desert Grass] to grow around Sandy City like that?"
1,"Imagine the implications of toggle able fireflys for farm interfaces and mini games 
Its going to be really fun to use"
1,"I currently do research in physics but my field isn't quantum information (which is what covers quantum entanglement). My understanding of entanglement is that the entangled objects should be considered as parts of a larger object, like the two sides of a coin. If you look at one side of a coin, you immediately know what's on the other side, and it's the same for entangled things. If you look at one half of the entanglement (≈ a side of a coin), you will immediately know what's the other half is. (Although all this is complicated by the fact that entangled systems are like the quantum version of a coin, which, from the perspective of someone doing this experiment, would show up as different results even if the set-up is entirely identical.)

I think the reason you've been hearing that information is transmitted at light speed is that the particles used in examples of entanglement are often photons (light particles), which move at the speed of light, and the information is transmitted when the photons are sent out. But as another commenter said, no information is transmitted when you look at your entangled half, even though you immediately know what the other half now is.

Hopefully this was coherent enough. As xkcd #2501 shows, sometimes you forget that the average person only knows the chemical formulas for olivine and one or two feldspars. 😅"
0,The firefly bushes are so beautiful!!
0,I never would of thought of some of the building tricks youre using with the new block
0,Please leave the well. It’s got a personality.
0,Love revisiting this
0,I like that you are trying terraforming. It makes such a big difference and you need a lot of material so you need good farms :)
0,Keep the classic well! A piece of history! 😊❤
0,"Oh, I need to check the update for myself now! For the well, I say keep it but transform it into something a bit more interesting."
0,"30:38 I think a hotspring or something would look cool over there, out of the way for privacy"
0,None of my worlds have ever had a particular theme. It’s just I thought that looked cool so I’m gonna put it there. I like the kinda just running with it idea.
0,Lets Gooooooooo Ergo is back!!
0,You can bone meal the grass in birch biomes and get the wildflowers that way. You don't have to find them.
0,"I vote bulldoze the well. 🙂 Love your Minecraft videos Etho, and the fact you always stay you."
0,"Absolutely love the wild mesa transition with all the shrubbery, with red sandstone outcrops, reminds me of Sedona, AZ. 
Oh man, the firefly bush is so cool, and the sandy sounds too. It is a great update for sure."
0,"That 1 block cacti can grow the flowers seems to break all the normal cactus farms. You gotta do observer/piston ones now, since the ""pop it off with a sign"" ones will now all eventually get stuck with flowers on every cactus."
2,"Etho, I thought of a new series. Kicking back to old school gaming videos on YT. A voice over chat while the gameplay is going. You have a “Simple Knowledge with Etho” series that you talk about something you learned, site your sources for others to dive into it. Kids really look up to you, you help them get excited about learning more things outside of school, I think that could really help."
1,8:03 I like the red sandstone! It goes really well with all of the different types of greenery.
1,"Hello Etho, I have trouble sleeping at night so I often listen to your videos to go to sleep that's helps me out , I was wondering if you are ever interested in dropping them as podcasts on like Spotify as some video podcasters do, love your videos."
0,"I think they should make the leaves place based off of cursor position instead of player position. That way you don’t have to spin around so much, especially when playing a lot of them."
0,Move the well to the other side of the path with the little clearing
1003,"For years I wondered why all of the wells I found contained water, never lava. Today I learned desert wells never actually generated with lava, that was just Etho being Etho."
0,"9 ep left till 600, gotta fix up the place for the 600 world download.

no pressure xD"
0,😎
0,I think i saw the same LED video you watched. Fascinating
41,"1.21.5 has made worlds feel so much more natural. The particle effects, the dried leaves everywhere, the fallen trees!! its all incredible"
1,Idea: Keep the well but you could upgrade it with the underground fireflies to make a wishing well (using skulk sensor to detect item burning)
0,"A lot has changed since this world was created. With all these mechanical game changes are you ever tempted, or have thought about, starting a new world?"
0,great video etho! the terraforming looks lovely
0,"Re: ""quantum physics is very theoretical and it's hard to show and prove its results"" 

On the contrary! Quantum physics predicts essentially every observed phenomenon at the atomic and subatomic levels - energy levels in atoms, the behaviors of semiconductors (which underlie CPUs, SSDs, LEDs, and much more), lasers, simple chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, superconductors, polarization of light, thermal radiation, blah blah blah. The main difficulty is that it's often very far removed from typical human experience: we never ""see"" individual atoms behaving certain ways, we don't directly interface with quantum phenomena often (notable exceptions being sunlight, LEDs (most modern light bulbs), fire, computers, lasers)"
1,"Hey Etho. Your terraforming is looking great. You are right, the well doesn’t go well with the new terraforming. Pun intended. The fallen trees also grow mushrooms. It looks really cool. Thanks for the video as always. Also one day I would love for you to ride one of my Minecraft roller-coasters. Thanks for inspiring me to create them."
0,I’ve played wiiu mc since 2020 and there have always been fallen trees with stumps.  Fyi
0,"Hello Etho, you may have answered this before but what kind of videos do you listen to in the background while building? Good job on the terraforming, you've improved a lot!"
16,"I really love the ""overgrown vegetation around the abandoned building"" vibe. I think it's very fitting!"
0,"this update also changed the ender pearl chunk loader once more, now not only ender pearls load chunks but they also do random ticks, so any farm that needs a player nearby just to do random ticks can use enderpearls instead, things like copper oxidizing or crops growing"
0,Definitely put the fireflies in the swamp / mushroom house area to make it more mystical
0,"34:35 science fan I see, I’d recommend the channel StyroPyro. I remember you mentioned how you would make fireworks and stuff like that as a kid, he does that but taken to eleven. Lots of chemistry stuff, lots of electronics stuff, I think you’d enjoy his content"
0,Elbows up 🇨🇦
0,can you just move the well elsewhere?
0,"Etho, the leaves also look like footsteps! (Maybe something for your trails/tunnels)"
1,"Loved the texturing jobs! Personally I love the orange of the orange sandstone but the textures and plants variation made it soooo much better.
Had no idea about the moss carpets! Nice! I was disappointed that the cactus flower didn't go on lily pads tho.
Thanks! Was fun to watch!"
0,Hoho we get treated nice ❤
0,34:17 Etho watches Veritasium videos!
2,"Wow, awesome. I can't wait to see the hermits reactions to these updates."
0,We may be descending into facism but at least I can rely on etho
1,"the dopamine levels my brain reaches when Etho uploads is unimaginable. Great episode as always, thank you Etho!"
1,Personally I think you should keep the well and try to make it blend in. You never cease to amaze with your building and creativity. Thanks Etho I've got just the snacks for this one
0,Bro I was just about to go to sleep and then I see there’s a new Etho video…😂
0,Move the well to the corner you were talking about needing a structure at toward the end of the video. Feels like a good compromise
0,I vote keep the well but move it out of the way.
1,How did Etho get the plants to grow around Sandy City like that?!
0,Completly unexpected! Etho likes an update with lots of plants! ;)
3,Went out last with some friends for my birthday (which is today) and now having a relaxing day with a nice upload treat. Thanks for being my go to for comfort content throughout the years ❤
0,the terraforming looks great
0,You should reconstruct the desert well! I bet it would look cool with a little upgrade
0,"Definitely keep the well, but I think moving it about 20 blocks away from the red sand building might give it the space for it to breathe and fit in."
35,"7:48 as someone who has been to Zion and Bryce national parks, it reminds me a lot of some of the more secluded areas of the parks. It works great and isn’t too busy!"
0,What food science channels do you watch?
0,"35:00 yeah the thing is, noone really understands quantum physics. Everyone is just half guessing, some people are just better at the guessing part. You know, the physics professor opening the first lecture with ""right now I'm the only one who doesnt understand quantum physics. In a couple of weeks you won't understand quantum physics either"""
0,"Etho, I say move the lava well to the corner where you said you would maybe build a structure at 30:40. No, it’s not the original, but I think moving it would be better than getting rid of it altogether.

Also, you’re such a G"
0,"I like the well, might need blending in a little, but I think it adds a point of interest in that little dip.
I really like how you did the terraforming there, it looks like rock formations sticking out of the desert, or like sand has been blown into the area from further out in the desert. The plants and leaf litter really add some life to it too.  Mojang did a really good job with this update!"
0,I miss etho playing modded 😭 can't believe terrafirmacraft was 10 years ago
0,That is really really convincing rough scrubland terrain!! I love it
0,"Etho, your thumbnail-less videos will forever be famous
But seriously it's pretty interesting how even without a ""proper"" thumbnail, and even if no characters are in the scene, something about the style of the chosen moment still makes it immediately recognizable to me as an etho video!"
0,"17:55 this was a realization for me too. I was making a guardian farm and accidentally pushed my carpets onto the water. It’s not just moss, normal carpets work too"
0,No need to be clingy with every sentimental build in the world. If it directly disrupts a new vision or project then it’s okay to remove it.
0,"for me, Etho videos are drop-everthing-and-watch videos"
40,"That veritaseum video on blue LEDs has to be my favourite on his channel! I showed my housemates the video and they were completely engrossed, it's a really good story"
1,How did you get that texture for the sandstone? I thought it was smooth on top? (slabs?)
0,I think the new minecart changes would be perfect for a mountain rollercoaster...
0,Etho play some Vintage Story its like terrafirma craft but its own minecraft style game
0,Keep the well! It's got the same nostalgic chaos of a Super Mario 64 level.
0,"i really love how the terraforming turned out. who would have thought that using tuff, wood, terracotta, and orange sand would look good together? not me! they really work well in the area you put them in. the practice you put in terraforming is really showing because the work you did on the desert looks amazing. if this is only practicing, im absolutely looking forward to what you can do in the future.

i think that the well should stay, you can make the random positioning make sense by adding ruins around the area :)

love the video! the quiet building transition in between clips is so satisfying."
0,ethooo :D
0,that blue led video was amazing i watched that a few weeks ago too
0,You could move the desert well over to that corner where you wanted that grass farm structure to be
0,eto!!!!!!!
0,Keep the well. I personally dont like when you remove old stuff - but the new terrain is looking nice
0,Ethowo~ 🤍
0,"It's crazy Etho plays minecraft for a living and plays on a 1080 monitor with a 2060! Pretty cool imo haha

also 27:33"
1,Im probably in the minority but the desert well needs to go.  Its just fit with work youve done in the desert.  Maybe if the desert was bigger id say keep it but that desert is too small for a well that big.
0,"A food fact. Cooking works by denaturing proteins. Sanitizers also work the same way, denaturing the proteins in bacteria cell walls. But this means you could take a steak, and ""sear"" a stake with sanitizer in the right concentrations and it would be a room temp stake! Isn't that awful? Also, my daughter says to keep the well."
0,"Veritasium recently kept a mind breaking video on quantum physics, and I study physics at a graduate level and its still mind blowing!"
0,"Do you have any specific science topic channels you like, or do you just choose them at random?"
0,Keep well!
1,You don't need all your areas to match thematically. I'm honestly over the Grian/BDoubleO style of building. It's extremely generic and you see it everywhere now. It mirrors almost how all new houses built IRL are the same colour palettes and designs now. Its part of the reason why I've enjoyed going back to Beta Minecraft.
11,"Okay, I’m stoked for this vibe, it’s fire fr."
0,"I vote keep all the old builds. As a newer (relative to the world) viewer, hearing the histories of the world and all the old builds and projects  is cool."
0,The firefly bushes seem pretty cool. The particle effects remind me of kokiri forest in ocarina of time
0,"Hey Etho, I love the OG intro and I was wondering, is it still possible to open the original chocolate island world in the current minecraft version?"
0,Thanks Etho for the quality vid. I completely forgot about all the stuff in this update so thanks for reminding me how cool all the new foliage is
0,"The terraforming looks AWESOME! Please keep the orange sandstone and the well (but if the well ends up looking weird, maybe move it?)"
0,"Wow, we get a video every update"
0,Yeah. This update is pretty great. Gives you new ideas to try. I love episodes like this. Get to see Etho polishing and terraforming. I am still working on my river from last time. So many great ideas. Thanks again!
0,"Etho, relocate the well to the corner you said you wanted to build a farm for the new plants."
1,Let's play!
0,"ive been watching etho since i was 13 i am 25 now, every time he uploads it takes me back to the school lunch and chocalte milk days."
0,"Bro my survival world i live in a desert, so thanks for the ideas!"
0,"i think you could upgrade the desert well, keeping the original vibe"
0,"tearing down old structures? no, those are heritage sites. improving them? sure I think that's perfectly fine"
0,10:39 who else didn't hear anything and checked to see if the video had paused??
1,"Thanks Etho, it's always a pleasure to watch your let's play. A special thank you for promoting self learning, it is absolutely important. My uncle told me something when I was young, it was the best advice ever. Now I'm an old dude and I can say it to all the young folks: never stop learning."
0,"Loving the look of the mesa section near your desert town.  I think if you do keep the well, you redesign it maybe if it doesn't quite fit in."
1,"etho, why don't you replay terraria soon? IDK if you're up to date, but they're planning to add a HUGE update and QOL things really soon. I loved both of the 1.3 & 1.2 playthroughs, and i want to see how you'll play it differently with all the updates. 'cause 1.3 is EZed"
0,"Etho, now you gotta add firefly particles in the mancave at night, just another indicator of the time of day there :)"
0,"21:00 - dark thought... Did no one think to ask for a Villager Permit on Hermitcraft? And NO NOT HUMAN TRAFFICKING!!! THAT'S EVIL!!!... 

...staffing agency. 😂😭🤣"
0,"Hey Etho, I am currently majoring in food science, and it’s not very common to find others interested in the topic as well. I gotta know, what’s the most interesting or favorite fact you’ve learned related to food science?"
0,You don't need to do new Minecraft trends. You can still do old building styles.
0,Keep the Well!!
0,"Etho!!! 💖 I love all your videos :D
and keep the well!"
0,"Your terraforming is so good!!! I love the mesa section so much!!
I haven't been watching long enough to have nostalgia for the lava well but lol I love it please keep it! Maybe add some detailing if you think it looks out of place?
Yay cactus flowers and leaf litter!! :D Dead bush with leaf litter around it is so cool!
The whole desert area looks so good now with the new blocks and your detailing!!!
Fun cactus flower farm design! And yay learning in general yeah!!"
0,"Hey Etho, what do you think of monads?"
0,Could move the well to that little corner you mentioned at 30:38
1,+1 to keeping the desert well
0,Please don't destroy that desert well
0,"I mostly liked the new terraforming, but having the sides of the path be that tall made it feel a little bit like a ""digsite"" to me.
Which could be a positive trait, but right now there is not really much other elements for that to fit in well imo.

I don't mind red sand, but stripped logs is a no go for me on many occations. Love the high contrast bark way too much for things like house corners.

Leaf litters seems to also be very easy to notice on the sand, and having them semi-randomly scattered made it feel like there was a very visible pattern.
I think chunks might be better for those than scattering them everywhere."
0,Leaf litter kinda looks like piles of poop. Do with that info as you will
0,"Finally, my prayers found the ears I was hoping"
0,"To really understand entanglement you have to understand the concept of superposition, which is a notoriously counter intuitive idea but sits at the heart of everything that makes quantum physics what it is. It takes most students a decade or more of dedicated study before they really begin to develop an intuition for these things, but they are nonetheless very real. The predictions of quantum physics are the best tested predictions ever made. More than any other thing, this idea of ""superposition"" is the biggest barrier to understanding between physicists and the general public today. During the first half of the 20th century, physicists went through a hell of a time trying to make sense of the things they were seeing in experiments. The whole classical framework of physics had to be rebuilt to account for the new observations. This was a long and arduous road fraught with wrong turns and philosophical debates about the very nature of reality. Today we have an excellent mathematical model and much of the early confusion has faded, but there is still a great deal of debate and controversy about how to *interpret* what we've learned. Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave, to name just a few. The Copenhagen interpretation is the de-facto standard but it is far from uncontroversial. I think the ideas of QM are actually easier to wrap your head around if you think in terms of the many-worlds view. You don't necessarily need to *believe* in the many worlds, you can get right back to Copenhagen anytime but just saying ""...and then God rolls a dice and picks one world to be real"". Entanglement is all about correlations or causal connections between superposition states. Imagine you have a hypothetical perfectly fair coin that never lands on its edge. If you flip the coin and look at it, it can only be one of two states, heads or tails, there is no other option. Okay, the fundamental insight of QM is this: ""if a system can be in one of a set of states, then it can also be in a superposition of those states"". Superposition is a mathy word... ""super-pose"" meaning something like ""overlay"" or ""add together"", it comes from the study of wave interference. You should think of it like a kind of mixture. QM says that if a coin can be heads or tails, then it can also be any arbitrary ""mixture"" of heads and tails! For example it could be 25% heads and 75% tails (slightly oversimplifying here), whatever. These ""mixture"" states are called superpositions and also ""indefinite states"" because they have no definite value, the coin is neither heads nor tails, but some strange combination of the two. If the state of the coin is 100% heads and 0% tails then we can say it has a ""definite"" state. This idea of superposition can be extended to any system with any number of states, not just 2. Even systems with an infinite number of states (eg. a particle in a box). It is this idea which is the source of all the craziness and weirdness in QM, if you can get your head around this, you're over the hump. The truly profound thing about QM is the realisation that this isn't some clever math trick - *this is how nature actually works*!"
0,I like the plants on the mesa area. It reminds me of the more deserty areas of the west USA.
0,"Hey Etho, since you were thinking about maybe getting rid of the sandstone well, why not replace some of the blocks with stairs or walls to make it look like its slowly breaking apart from old age? Make it look like years of bad weather have slowly taken affect of it's condition."
0,Hi etho this is the first video ive watched as a new subscriber. I really enjoyed it also i love the desert well so i would suggest you keep it
2,"wise parting words at the end, because you never know when ""useless knowledge"" might actually become useful in your life."
0,"""that's how people used to play in the past, just putting things wherever"" Etho, that's how I play now in 2025. My longest running world right now (only like 530 in game days but its fine) is a hole in the ground with miscellaneous things just on the surface around it"
1,"As kid I grabbed my snacks.
As a adult now I should be making a meal.
Either way.
I'm watching etho"
0,"To echo others, I'd absolutely keep the well!"
0,"Was not feeling great recently but your new episode has made my troubles feel lighter, thanks for uploading Etho"
0,"Etho you have to keep the desert well, otherwise I won’t be Desert Well anymore :("
1,"Mr Slab! Would you consider a second channel that is low effort mostly unedited videos of your hermitcraft or the old starblight desert footage? Or perhaps would you consider streaming again? Anyway (I know you have heard this a million times before but I just gotta say it) love your videos, thank you for being here all these years!"
0,At a minimum keep the button!
0,"Etho you're the best. Been a viewer since 2012. With all this coverage on AI, there are many benefits and issues that arise. Would love to hear your thoughts on it! Much Love - Sebastian"
0,Please keep the well😩
0,I did not know the moss carpet trick on water! Very cool 😃
0,"hi etho,
i dreamt that you did a collaboration with setsuna ogiso (niche fictional character) from white album 2 (niche anime). and geminitay. so. just a thought"
0,Epic deserts
0,KEEP it
0,Hi Ergo! I really enjoy the episodes that are focused on revamping old areas and reliving the nostalgia but seeing new ideas arise from old ones. Do you think you will be revamping some parts of the Man Cave with newer blocks? I think that it's been a while since the Man Cave has been touched. I think as well with terraforming you could come up with some funky decorations that I'm looking forward to seeing.
0,"I subbed to Gneiss Name some months ago, he does geology and color theory stuff and makes models and presentations for it in Minecraft. I love natural sciences so when I found it, it was an instant must-watch when he uploads"
0,Is Etho back back? 2 videos in 2 weeks ❤
0,hot take: all the new plant stuff should require a shear to pick up
1,"Hi Etho, when I visit one of my old Minecraft worlds, for every build in it, it brings back all the memories of where I was in life at that time. 
I wonder if it is the same for you, and if you like visiting some parts of your LP world more or less because of that?
Have a great day."
0,First off I'm impressed by the terraforming! Second I think the well might go in that corner you thought needed a structure? Could be cool to keep it's history :)
1,"I love all the new stuff in this update <3 I vote to keep the well where it is, it looked fine in the end with all the dry grass around it, maybe place some small and big pots around it."
0,Keep the desert well! It's history.
0,This upload made my day. Thanks Etho!
0,Put a little broken caravan in that corner with some spilled stuff
0,Wasn’t there a 1 block tall crawling base that Etho built in the mountains by his desert?
0,"Hey etho, have you ever thought about mapping out your world? With how much has been built over the years it gets hard to remember what is where, i'm sure you have difficulties navigating too. Also in the description you wrote 1.21.1 instead of 1.21.5"
1,"Maybe you could embed the red sand generator in slime blocks as a sort of museum piece. That could look good in the desert biome , better than it is currently. Like it’s entombed in jello 😂"
0,I remember watching this guy when I was like 9 I’m 19 now man
0,I think removing the well is very good idea
0,I'm definitely an old school style minecraft builder. Random ideas there and here and all over.
0,"7:26 The reveal, it looks so beautiful! You did wonderful work!"
0,:)
1,"I think you should keep the well! You could blend it or change the blocks and improve it. Idk I like it but sometimes you need to erase the past to write more future. Idk that wasn’t suppose to sound deep but I think you get my drift. Anyways thanks for the video and all the entertainment over the years, heck decades now :)"
0,An idea for the terracotta side is an arch. Something like Corona Arch in Utah.
0,"I always love a Sandy City episode, I still remember when you started it.

Also, miss slab city although it wasn't meant to be <3"
1,"watching you find out and then explain the new features is always my favorite way of learning about the new updates! xisuma and others are doing a great job at giving us a lot of technical info, but there's something special in just hopping into the game, with very limited info on the update, and figuring things out!! reminds me of when i was a kid, and didn't know where and how to read patch notes, so i had to just experiment on my world!"
0,14:30 does that mean classic cactus farms dont work? since eventually they would fill with flowers?
0,So Etho is a Veritasium fan
0,"Hey Etho! Since you like science I thought I'd share my favourite science fact: magenta is not a real colour! Magenta is in between violet and red, but because violet and red are on opposite ends of the colour spectrum, the brain then lies, and finds the average of the two colours, and makes it up. There are also impossible colours, such as Stygian Blue!"
0,"You can always add like juniper trees, or bristle cone pine trees around to make your deserts feel less cliche tropical adjacent, and truly arid"
0,"The well should be kept, yeah."
0,"Perfect moment for Etho video. 11:20 pm, looking for something before sleep, got my tea ready, and.. Etho video!"
0,Keep the well for sure
0,10:58 the well HAS to stay
0,"Lets go, got some pizza and Etho LP life is good"
0,"Definitely keep the old build Etho! Either as is or repurpose the interior I reckon. I actually really like the contrast that build offers, especially now that you've dressed the whole area!"
0,broken farms update
7,"30:40 maybe move the well to the other side of the sand building. You can keep it and its history, but make it fit better to the environment"
0,dont destroy the desert well! build around it!
0,"The sandstone texture is very very coarse for being so high up, when its tonally opposite the rough texture of the tuff. The pattern is getting smoother on the gray to orange, then sandstone ruins it at the end"
0,I love learning about stuff unfortunately i have too much stuff to learn about and now it' going to be mostly for work. But i love more than anything is learning practical things like speaking a new language and learning to fix things on my own. The feeling of improving and mastering is great.
0,Do you and bdubs communicate on upload times or something? 😂
0,"For the well, i think moving it to a better planned location would work

Otherwise if you're interested in colors, i'd recommend learning more about what purple is - such as the ""line of purples"", confusion with violet depending on culture; as in language, place and time in history, and how that confusion interacts with the Abney effect. Also how languages start coming up with names for colours. Short and sweet."
13,11:49 I say remove the desert well and leave a few blocks like a ruin
0,"I say keep the well, but maybe move it a little so it’s more cohesive with the rest of the space, center it and make it a focal point of that little dip"
1,Grab ur snacks!
0,I love watching Etho on a sunday night. Calms down my anxiety before having to work on monday
0,Etho wants to get sandy city done by episode 600 so hes just reducing his upload speed to give himself more time at this rate hes got a year or so to do it.
0,Etho has awoken
0,dont remove the well!
1,13:42  am I correct that cactus flower has now broken cactus farms ?? 🧐 if so this is acctually a big issue 🤣🤣
1,i say keep the well; it's so fun to have that!!
0,"History is one of the things that makes this series legendary, and it can't be replicated. Not by anyone. That being said, I wouldn't care if it changed to fit the terrain, or was even moved to an entirely different place. Growth and change are also good stories to tell."
0,Ooh! The overgrown mesa looks great!
0,I reaallly like what you did with the orange sandstone!
0,"I love the way the red sand area is turning out so far! The only thing that I think could use a bit of tweaking is that yellow sand bit where you added all of the grass. I feel like it is a bit overwhelming, maybe tone it down a little bit. Sometimes less is more :)"
1,Patrick: why don't we take the well and put it somewhere else! (like maybe that area you wanted to fill next to the sand factory)
0,Something tells me Etho subscribes to Veritasium
1,Cogito Etho sum
0,The ultimate desert Tuff Guy
0,I love the randomly dropped videos.🇨🇦❤️❤️
0,"I think what really makes a highly efficent cactus flower farm hard is the fact that they can grow on cacti, that are one tall as well. If my thoughts are correct, you need to break the second block of a cactus (which makes it inefficient, because a 3 tall cactus has a higher chance of getting a flower) BUT you also need to break/replace the first cactus block as well. If I understand the mechanics correctly, if a 1 tall cactus grows a flower and you break it, it will neither grow back nor will the cactus grow. So given a lot of time, a farm would at some point stop producing?"
0,No! Don't take it down. It's so sweet. Just leave it.
0,So are cactus farms way more complicated now because you have to account for the fact a flower could randomly grow? Do cactus farms have to be based on pistons now instead of the pop-off feature?
1,"Loving the terraforming. I’d add some more splashes of colour going further out into the white sand, but the colours and textures are great. ❤🎉"
0,I grabbed my snacks to watch some YouTube and wouldn’t you know who posts… YOU! Lol. Bubs and Etho amazing duo
0,I think you should keep the desert well! Also I love all the experiments with the firefly bush. It makes me think of an enchanted forest with the floating lights. Got me all inspired to build!
0,"hey etho i love the landscaping but i think that having it so wild may not make sense right outside sandy city, at least the paths I feel might be more well kept as they run through and between more rough and wild areas"
0,I have missed your episodes!
0,The prophecy…
0,"FloatHeadPhysics is a channel I’ve been watching lately, he makes some really fascinating and easy to understand videos about relativity, gravity, light, subatomic particles, radiation, etc., I think you’d like them! My personal recommendation is to check out his series about the book Relativity Visualized, and especially the one about curved time.

Also, the terraforming worked out super well! Now’s as good a chance as any to utilize those mountains in the back for something like farming those new bushes and cactus flowers, though that would mean terraforming a section of the mountains all the way lol, up to you. Great video!"
0,"hey everyone, sorry if it's a dumb question, but what is that flying white build with the water going down (you can see it for example at 13:26) thanks in advance"
0,(there are so many hermit videos today! 😊)
0,It would be great for a Ethos spin on Vintage Story
1,Maybe move the well into the city?
1,"@11:25 I'd say remove it. It's there in older downloads, it has served its purpose. Few fans nowadays would appreciate its existence. Sure, it's nostalgic, but if it's that important, just move it somewhere."
0,"You could use buttons made from Cherry, Mangrove or that Red Nether wood for your cacti made of melon. That way, they look a little more like the actual ingame cactus :)"
0,"If you delete the well, you should rebuild it elsewhere."
0,"This video was fun to watch. I *may* have watched 2x the length of the video because it took me one hour to watch the first 15 minutes because I was playing Zelda for an hour while watching the video and kept rewinding to completely take in the video. I heard it’s good for channels to have viewers spending more time watching the video than the time in the video itself, so I’m happy I could do that."
0,I am for keeping the Well!
0,omg i just woke up from a nap and dreamed that you uploeaded something
0,Thanks for the upload Mr Slab 🙏 hope your having a good day
0,keep the desert well!
0,Happy Eid for me thanks dear Etho
0,"Hey Etho, I’d love to see more of the jungle cave project. I thought it would be cool if you added armour stands to the plantera fight."
6,"The desert changes look awesome! I love the tuff cliff area. In my opinion I don't think you should remove the well, yeah it looks a bit simple and old but it has been there for years and is part of the history of your world. It shows the evolution of your world, and the fact you had to make your own version of something that has been in the game for so long is a really cool detail!"
0,"Love the mini mesa, seems everyone else does too :) great work etho <3"
0,I really like the tuff in the badlands areas it kind of reminds me of bentonite clay you find in places like drumheller.
0,"I'd keep it, but find a new location for it."
0,"I personally think you don't have to concern about blending too much (that's new-school). Think of it more as history since it's an old world. You wouldn't tear down a historical building would you? Even though it's out of place and doesn't have a function, it's a place people can look at and say ""hey, this is how it was done X amount of years ago"". Please don't remove history, even if it's ugly. We learn from history."
1,i think you should tear down the desert well
0,"I am the same, I love science. That you mentioned that in your comment of the day.  This was so wholesome for me. Thank you Etho 😊"
0,Etho's new update videos are my favourite videos.
0,who remembers the world download with the house on the hill with the redstone torch that activated the tnt xD
0,Always nice to hear Mr slab
0,Keep the well
1,The Tango @ 23:19 
0,You could move the well to the corner you wanted a small structure instead of fully removing it.
0,on youtube ' Something Strange Happens When You Trust Quantum Mechanics' has a very cool experiment in the end of the video showing the theory of partials exploring all possible routes.
0,Idea: cactus flowers on some of your melon cacti?
0,DON'T TEAR DOWN THE DESERT WELL
0,Love the new little mesa area.
0,Sleep can wait
1,Keep the well!
0,An important thing to note about the cactus flowers is if there is a block next to where the flower would be they won't grow
66,"As a newer Etho fan, I love that his lets plays aren't super duper cohesive and don't follow some sort of storyline or anything because I'll literally just pick a random episode and watch it, note it down and keep going. It's an easier way to digest all the content I've missed over the years as a new fan. (Got into Etho after watching him herding the ravagers for frogger in Grian's video)"
1,"I think it's OK to get rid of the well. You don't need to be beholden to the past. Alternately, remake it to be your own design."
0,"I wonder if there's a way to preserve the well by incorporating or into the lore of the town? I'm just spit balling here, but maybe the well is seen as part of the town's historical district. You could have the well be the logo for some business that started around the time the town was founded, i.e. A bar. But maybe that bar is a casino now? Or a grocery store. I hate the idea of the well being entirely removed though. Whatever you do, I think it should be rebuilt somewhere, even if it is a little out of place. Maybe it could be the start of a memory lane."
1,"HEY ERGO, i think it could be a cool idea to use the coarse dirt after the path blocks to further blend the desert into the grass lands!"
0,"Oh my god, I didn’t know that about moss carpet on water. I need to add it somehow to my world. 18:04"
0,I hope you keep the well. Maybe make that feature displayed like something in a museum or an archeological dig so it serves a purpose and can be blended to the environment. Thanks for the video!
0,I really like the seapickles. They are like little cacti.🌵
0,2 etho videos in 2025? we are truly blessed
35,"Hey Etho! You mentioned wanting to put a structure in the space to the left of the red sand thing... And also possibly remove the well...
Why not move the well?"
0,"You should keep the Desert Well, but if you think there's a better spot for it, you could move it."
0,The desert area is looking great! the terraforming that you did this episode looks good and has a nice amount of busyness. Thank you for uploading!
0,Love the terrain and the orange! 😊
0,Lichen can blend green and sand !
0,yet we still dont have vertical halfslabs but the ability to put leafs on 4 different quads is ok
1,HES BACK.... IN LESS THAN A MONTH?!
2,"One thing I like to do with old builds that look a bit meh now is to make them into ruins- just rough them up a bit, break some parts off and put the blocks on the ground nearby. Swap for cracked and broken variants. People love it."
3,"Great advice at the end, any recommendations on good youtube channels about any of these topics?"
0,"i would say keep the desert well, or if youre torn between getting rid of it and keeping, move it like some comments have pointed out; im a sucker for nostalgia and all that so imo i would keep it"
0,"Keep the desert well! Maybe add a path up to up and add stuff around it, but it's part of the history of this world and series."
0,"I know the exact blue LED video you're talking about, and it really was fascinating"
0,Am I the only one who’s disappointed that shrubs weren’t re added? We got so close to them being back. I’ve been playing forever and now I’m complaining about silly little things like this. I will say this update is much bigger than I thought it was. I love your positive view of things. This update isn’t bad at all.
0,"If you haven't seen it, Veritasium had a video about jumping spider vision that I thought was fascinating"
0,Maybe use that desert empty corner to make a simple bonemeal farm for the new desert grass and firefly bush! Should be a relatively small and simple farm that could really fill that out and make a reason to come to this newly built area
0,"Although people want you to keep the well, I think that it would be ok if you were to move it elsewhere to free up the space."
0,1:31 I'd say keep it for old-time's sake. maybe you can convert it into something else in the future
0,Lol the dried leaves kinda looks like poop scattered around the desert 😂
0,Keep the desert well! But lol no etho I don’t think anyone knew about putting moss on the water lol.
0,"I love the new desert, but the bright green leaves don't feel right to me for some reason. Like the browns and the yellows,  they make more sense to me :) also keep the well!"
11,Don't get rid of the well lol. I remember dying in that trap 😂
0,Omg it’s eeeeeefoooooo
0,"I still want a boat with a barrel update, chests are one thing, but a fishing barrel in a boat makes a ton of sense."
0,i wonder if Etho would ever make a list of any of his favorite videos he's watched and learned from. Id be very interested to know what tidbits of knowledge he finds himself using most often 👀
0,16:33 that's a feather duster lol
0,"dear etho,
  How have you been?  Are things well?
This is my question:  What do you think about the announced vibrant visuals(vanilla shaders)?  Do you think this is a good thing or do you worry that it might negatively impact minecraft?  From what was shown, I think Mojang has done a good job but I was wondering what you thought. Will you use it in your LP?"
1,"35:00 ""Instantly"" and the speed of light are essentially the same thing in the context of human thought. We use the word instantly as less of a quantifiable metric and more of a way to describe something that happens as fast as we're able to observe it. We require light to observe things, so the speed of light is as instantaneous as it gets for us."
0,"Great video, have a good day!!"
0,You don't need shears to collect the firefly bush
0,"The tuff and Sand really makes the colors pop, looks great!"
0,It’s gunna be a good day 😊
8,"My favorite thing you’ve ever made is that potion store in mind crack, the Etho style to your builds is something that nobody can recreate. The Mesa area is definitely up there in my favs. Also if you get rid of the well I’ll scalp myself."
0,"Hi Etho, I really enjoyed this episode. I really like the new Minecraft update format I feel like you're getting more? Instead of a batch update you're getting little things over time, keeps the game interesting and exciting. I have a question, do you think you'd ever pick up No Mans Sky again? They've done so many updates and it's such a fun game I figured you would enjoy it and I'd love to see you play it. If not are there any other games you're playing right now that you're super into? Thank you for the episode hope you're doing well ♥"
0,the terraforming is amazing i love it
0,"Hey Etho, love the videos! But don't you dare remove the desert well. It's a historical structure, and it needs to be there. I remember you adding it and when you showed the death trap. That was fun.

Instead, try to add a custom tree/bush near it. That'll give the well a story. Alternatively, a dead plant, almost as if the well provided water and life to the plant, and after the well got corrupted with lava, the plant died along with it."
2,"All historic monuments should be kept around. If it's ugly - congratulations, you've made progress!"
0,Keep the well i think it adds a touch that the world has been lived in
1,You can harvest firefly bushes with your hand
2,"I would love to see the well stay. The trap aspect of it can be removed for renovations of the area or changed into another function but the well, lava, and button should remain. With the new vegetation added the well looked great whereas before it stood out a lot. 
Then again I may be too sentimental, I'm still sad the horse jump area was removed."
0,"I've been thinking of that red sandstone wall, and I wonder if it might not be a good place to sprinkle in a few resin blocks as highlights? There's some angles where you've got red sandstone in both the foreground and background of the view, and they blend together in an unsatisfying way. (See 10:40)"
0,I think you should make the well look like an overgrown ruin. Then it will be a memory in the world but it'll be better incorporated in the environment.
0,"In that corner where you want to put a structure you should put the desert well. It's kind of just a random corner anyway, and the size is just right. That way you keep the history but less obtrusively."
0,i love your building style mr slab
1,"Hey Etho! Not sure if you've addressed this, but why don't you play on snapshot versions for your lp world anymore? Just wondering if there is a reason you decide to wait for the full releases."
0,"I really like the leaf litter usage in the desert! What if you used the leaves to indicate a direction the wind is blowing through the desert, to accommodate the new wind noises? make them all trail off in a similar direction, idk if you could use blocks to indicate that as well"
0,"first episode i get to watch as it comes out since im now caught up! mesa area looks so good, firefly bushes work perfectly there"
0,"i'm glad etho's so happy about the update, personally i find the new stuff kinda feels rushed to me? like the development manager was just trying to get the update out the door so they didn't have time to extend the custom variant capabilities to *the rest of the mobs that have variants*, or add sheep variants, or do more with the ""weapon"" item component, or add more sound variants for mobs other than wolves, or add more environmental soundscapes to biomes... and i hope they're given more time for future ""game drops"" (although, according to the teaser calendar during minecraft live, we might be getting FOUR *this year*...)

idk, maybe i was reverse-spoiled by the terraria devs taking as much time as they wanted to make a good update so when *any* dev team tries to get New Content Out Constantly it feels like being handed a new slice of cake before you've even started the first one, instead of finishing the first slice and having time to contemplate before you even realize there *could be* another slice..."
0,"Strays do have a player-specific drop, which is slowness arrows. So wolves would help if you wanted to farm those."
0,"Have you seen Jake Kelton Crafts redstone Animation videos, such as animated flags or fans?
I would love to see what you come up with if you give it a try creating red stone animation-contraption!"
3,Bebo has returned. My life is now on hold for the next 36:22.
0,"Once again, I dropped everything to watch some etho. A good day"
0,Have you thought about what you want to do after youtube?
0,"17:50 

Let me tell you I was shocked XDD I have never heard of that. Not even once"
0,Glad to see new update eXplored in the Let's Play instead of seeing it off camera on multiplayer server! Really makes me think of how all these new things could impact the Let's Play world and how they can improve it like the desert grass in Sandy City. Can't wait for the next episode...as always.
0,Keep the well but move it so that it fits in better
0,"I am a chemistry major and hoping to get into food science a bit, kinda curious, do you have any favorite food science related factoids?"
5,"A quick thanks for posting this today. It's a grey rainy day and was feeling a little blue. Saw your video upload and I smiled. You've brought many hours of joy over the years. Appreciate you, man."
0,Leaf litter would look great in that tree covered path you have
0,Seeing those falling leaves in your video feels so strange for some reason.
1,“ I think were gonna use this stuff alot”  YUP‼️‼️‼️
1,"Sabine Hossenfelder is hands down my favourite science channel. When I was in my PhD, by nature of my expertise, we had to do a LOT of philosophy of science. Sabine is one of the few science YouTubers who I feel talks like how scientists are meant to. Words like ""evidence indicates"" or ""it seems that"" or ""the consensus is"". Science is a method and a dialogue; not just a series of facts. I like it when public speakers nail that.

Also she has an oddball sense of humour."
0,Keep the well
1,"Hey Etho! I know game design is something that fascinates you. If you were to revise any system in Minecraft to improve its game design, what would it be and how would you fix it? Sleep? Hunger? Enchanting? Villagers? Transportation? Combat? Bloat? Something else?"
0,17:50 No way! :O
0,Thanks Etho!
0,"17:50 this works with normal carpet too, I think"
2,"33:15 you don't need two pistons to push the slime blocks since they will stick to each other, so you could make the redstone way smaller"
0,The blue LED video got to be the Veritasium one
0,Hey etho what would you think about making the mini mesa a bit flatter? The rock outcroppings you've made are quite jagged and not as flat as we're used to seeing with a badlands style terrain so I was wondering
0,I don't catch all of the episodes these days but it's still appreciated Etho!
0,"Transport the well elsewhere! Good for history, but might not fit there any more"
0,"love the badlands area, i think the orange sandstone looks great actually especially with how you blended it into the tuff. i will say i think the plantwork you did is maybe like 10% too much it feels a little tooo detailed and cluttered and sometimes having a bit more room to breathe can add a lot to a build"
1,"hey etho you said about learning the sciences. What about the arts? like classical music, or painting?"
0,"Thank you for the og chill minecraft videos. I dont really play it any more, but i adore watching your excitement about new content :)"
0,"I guess I missed some update previews coz it's my first time seeing the bush and the fireflies! Both looks so good and adds so much life , add the falling leaves too! Great job on the terraforming job, the orange sandstone looks fine to me. The leaf litter and desert grass could use a bit of clustering I think but overall fantastic job"
7,"The terraforming was amazing!! The difference in the level between the terraforming in this video and the last HC video was pretty incredible, you're accelerating so quickly !!"
1,"11:25 I think keep the well! It is history and blends in well, however maybe update it slightly? Making it a bit more detailed, taller and more pointy, I think would look cool."
1833,"Physicist here :) Quantum Entanglement IS instant, but it does not convey information (meaning, you cannot send a message using it), hence it doesn't break the speed limit (relativity). Hope that helps! And hey, great Let's Play video Etho, we were missing those over here 😉"
1,"I love quantum physics, my favourite quote is from Einstein describing entanglement calling it ""spooky action at a distance"" and it's supposedly instantaneous. I especially like that anyone who says they fully understand quantum physics is either lying to you or themselves."
0,Is this the first the Etho has acknowledged the desert well?
0,I feel like this modern overly-detailed style clashes with the more classical style in the area around sandy city. Maybe it'll be better if he keeps adding more
0,maybe you could actually move the desert well
0,Doesn’t that mean your og cactus farm is broken now?
0,You're watching Ethoslabbbbbb.....you're watching EthossssssLABBBBBB
0,Been watching some old Etho FTB episodes lately. Feels like this is running at 2x playback speed.
0,KEEP THE WELL
0,Id say keep the well but improve it.
0,"I may push back a bit on the notion of dithering sand and grass, I usually try to create a nice mix of both like that akin to those beachsides which go from shrubby grass to shore. Mixing the new desert grass and normal grass has helped me out with that!"
0,"Loving the recent terraforming arc.  I think the well could use an update! Acknowledge the history, but make it blend in to the area.  Maybe a commemorative plaque or something to explain its original purpose?"
0,Move the well!
0,"😊  I love it, it's like the wilderness and the desert are competing on the edges; and the pathways would be more sandy.  I watched that video as well, I think it was a Veritasium video. PBS has lots of videos on quantum physics. I like the quote that a physics professor said, ""If you think you understand quantum physics, you don't understand quantum physics.""  There is also a Universe Podcast with John Green and Katie Mack that was fascinating to listen to."
0,"Also the well has to stay. You did this to yourself by being like ""uh huh not everyone knows this but that's not a naturally generated well... 😌"" every 20 episodes since you built it"
0,"11:25
For the well you should keep it. However you may still change the build to fit the terrain a bit better. Idk keep up the good work"
0,1.21 jigawatts! Great Scott!
0,"etho, if you're looking for videos on quantum physics, Scienceclic and Domain of Science have great videos on the topic"
0,Etho you should consider adding string to stop the snow on the mountain with the glowing tree from your outro. It's kinda a historical artifact that got uglified by the update where they added snowy mountains
0,I sit down for dinner and what do I see? An upload from ergo waiting for me
0,I feel like you should keep your well ! It blends in nicely with the new foliage !
0,I'VE SEEN THE BLUE L.E.D. VIDEO TOO! I love Veritasium and the fact Etho watches him too doesn't surprise me.
1,Leave the well! The history of this world is the most important part in my opinion
0,You could move the shrine to the small side area. It would be a perfect fit!
0,keep well
0,ETHO UPLOAD YAY!
4,bdubs and etho’s upload schedule intertwined as usual
0,how is this etho mf both one of the best redstoners and one of the best builders...god of minecraft himself
1,😮
16,"Me who hasn’t watched any Minecraft content in years, “Wth is Tuff?”…”Version 1.21??” 😂 

Last thing I remember are those shulker boxes. Guess I’ve got a lot to catch up to if my daughter ever gets interested in playing!"
1,"Hey Etho! I've noticed lately that when you make cuts in your videos it's right after you've just said something and the next clip starts immediately when you start talking again. Personally I feel like this can make sections of your videos feel very dense. Maybe it's a good idea to leave a bit more breathing room in between the talking when making cuts :) idk how others feel about it, but to me it's a little jarring. Besides that I still love the episodes like always <3"
0,It's nice going back to terraforming episodes
0,"Oh, this is gonna break the redstoneless cactus farms"
0,Hey Etho! Should I go to prom in a t shirt and sweat pants!
0,etho upload on my birthday this is the best present
0,"I'd move the well on the larger patch of sand towards the wheat fields. You can switch to a birch button to blend it in and maybe switch the lava to water and gather a (non-working) suspicious sand block and make a trap out of that for the next world download 
I love the mesa, i would have built more of it higher up the mountain on the other side of the yellow/red sand converter"
1,"I say keep the desert well. I think its unique/shows the worlds history. 

Also, question that I'm sure you've answered before but just thought i'd ask. Why not do video sponsors? I personally wouldn't mind at all and I'm sure a majority of your viewers wouldn't either. Especially if it helps you out/allows for more freedom for you in regards to what videos you make/when you make them. I know you've talked in the past about other games you would like to play on but that don't do as well as your minecraft videos.  Would sponsors help with that? (I personally have really enjoyed some of the other series you've made and would love to see more of those.)"
0,"I'm in love with the new cactus flower, It looks incredible!"
0,17:55 You can also do that with wool carpets!
27,18:53 it’s like leaving breadcrumbs behind you while you’re walking in the forest so you don’t get lost
0,"Super exciting to see this posted, especially right after I spent some time exploring the update myself! Really amazing speed, especially for the amount of work you did-- the transition between sand colors in the desert looks really good, and the rough badlands area in-between works really well! 

It's great that Mojang is really bringing some of the rougher areas of the game to life with new updates, so out of curiosity: do you have any biomes that you'd like to see an update for?"
0,such a simple wisdom suggestion but it's brilliant! do take care of yourself with a bit of knowledge about why we do things and what helps us!
153,30:45 You should move the well in this corner. This way you will preserve history and have space on the other side for the terraforming.
1,"I think that you should do the terrain whenever you get an area where sand clearly feels out of place, but you can't really just switch over to grass because it'll still be in a desert biome."
0,i'm gonna have to reload my world to see how this looks now!!
0,"Hey Etho, was the video you watch happen to be Veritasium"
0,"I like the well! but if it's obnoxious there, you could move it to the corner where you wanted a structure?"
204,What I love about your world is that it is just builds wherever you want to do builds. Never been a big fan of super huge cohesive worlds. That is for some people but I much prefer your variety.
0,Etho!! I love the way you did the terrain it looks so good!
0,ETHOOOOOO
0,I love ALL EthosLab videos!
0,"For the well, I think it should stay, but I would recommend giving it a little more detail for environmental storytelling. Either add some dry grass and maybe a skeleton head to signify it's long since dried up, or you could fill it with water and add some firefly bushes or ""bushes"" around it, maybe even with llamas in the area, for some movement. I miss seeing the llamas walk around sandy city -like that- where did they go?"
0,Bdubs and now Etho! AND ITS A SINGLE PLAYER UPLOAD!!! Today is a good day!
0,red sandstone the well!
0,"The terraforming is sooo good. Great job! 
I can't unsee that the leaves litter look like someone stepped in dog poo."
0,Will this break the regular fence-cactus farms?
0,"20:10

The dried leaves look like footprints…could be coyote trails in the desert"
0,"I think the desert well has to stay for world nostalgia reasons, even though it's ugly. The old (minecraft world gen) stuff was ugly, thats part of the charm!"
1,I lucked out my first wandering trader had the yellow/white flowers
0,I adored this episode. The terraforming looks amazing
27,"This is the first time I actually have seen the 1.21.5 drops in game, I've only seen clips and stuff like that from Minecraft Live. I love when there is an update and you experiment with it. You always think of something that I hadn't thought of to explore with the new items. 

I think that you should leave the desert well. It's a part of the world, and one with a fun story as well! I'm not ashamed to say that the traps have gotten me a couple of times, its one of my favorite parts of exploring!"
0,"I think with the well you could relocate it somewhere nearby so it's still preserved, especially as you made it yourself."
0,The well deserves to exist
0,leave the well!
0,Why is he playing this long series in an amplified world?
0,"I really like all the textures and stuff, but it all feels very chaotic and clustered together. I think it might be better if things were more spread out, although I know there's not much space to work with."
0,"i really liked this episode! 
very chill, exploring and studying stuff, terra forming and your voice were on point!
the new changes are really nice, so beautiful!"
0,Etho can you stream again please thanks
0,33:30 OOOOH sounds like Etho is a Technology Connections girlie
0,"Such a wholesome episode, thanks Etho :)"
0,"Etho! Love your videos, I was wondering if you plan on watching the upcoming Minecraft movie?  Also curious of your thoughts on it in general! Thanks."
0,"Keep the well, but modify it"
0,34:23 veritasium is amazing!
0,"Perhaps move the well? It is tiny enough that moving it wouldn't be such a big deal,and it does look a bit weird on the border"
2,Now in regards to your answer to the question of the vid: you said its harder to get a grasp on quantum physics bcs theories are different and harder to show/prove etc. But then you are interested in the way humans work. Based on the first part i would assume philosophy is not your thing bcs they [and me] like to argue different points and barely get anywhere; but then the way humans work is exactly philosophical antropology. I would love to hear your opinion about it :>
0,Fun idea: I added the leaf litter in a staggered line from my door way to create like a muddy entryway to my house
0,I WAS tired . Then I saw etho posted haha . I aint sleepy
693,Please leave the desert well. I'm one of the people you killed with it.
0,"I don't think you should get rid of the well, its nostalgic. However, it really isnt in a great place, maybe you could move it to a more open area of sand further away from the mesa-esque wall"
0,"Thank you Etho for the new video! 
Nice terraforming. Little inspired by island 7? Nothing wrong about little inspiration!"
0,Etho and bdubs on the same day?? We're spoiled for choice!
501,11:03 keep the desert well; I think it fits in nicely!
0,"GO GET YO SNACKS

edit: I adore the red sandstone look, it looks so good there! and please keep the well, blend it in maybe but its history, and I rarely see any world incorporate it!"
1,Wow that is amazing.  You should keep the well though as it has been there for so long.  I do wonder with the changes made does the fire charges Etho sign still work?
14,Love how the Terraforming is going so far. One minor thing I’m not a fan of though is I think it’s a little too busy in the flat sandy areas. Maybe remove the leaf litter that’s not at the edges and tone down the desert grass. Asides from that I think the area really turned out well and I hope some time in the future we can see more of your Terraforming learning experiences. ❤
0,It looks good!!
0,What do you think about adding a museum type of area where you move all the things that dont fit anymore? It can preserve the history while leaving the area open for new possibilities.
0,"if a building doesn't fit the world, then put it under a tarp or build a building around it, that way you still got the old building inside a building that might fit the theme more. that way you still got the history from the old times."
0,"11:05 keep and expand that well, make it big fancy with some new blocks in the details."
17,"I love that you’ve been in a building/terraforming mood lately! Not that I don’t love your usual stuff, but as someone who isn’t big into building and terraforming myself, I enjoy seeing the process unfold. I completely relate to testing things out, sitting with it for a bit, and seeing what works and what doesn’t.

I was also not aware of this update at all and I loved learning about it and exploring it through you.

Always a great day whenever you upload - thanks for all you do Etho! :D"
0,Maybe relocate the desert well? Its not a naturally generated one but the concept of it reminds you (and us now) of the little pranks you'd pull on world dowloads. That or make a mega lava fountain.
1,"Hi Etho, I know that you always mention that you watch videos on the side while you build. That are you favorite things to watch while playing minecraft. I hope you have a great day!"
0,keep the desert well but upgrade it and make it fancier
0,Did not expect the terraforming to look that good. I wonder if the yellow sand path / 9:25 would blend in better  to the red sand frame if the darker birch logs and planks were on the outside and the sandstone and sand on the inside of the path. I would say oak too but it may be too thin for that
0,"You could move the well to the small area where you wanted to have a small structure, then it keeps the history and makes the area cleaner, win win"
2149,"I don't think it's unfortunate that your world doesn't have an overarching theme. I think it's better that you aren't constrained by that, and I like that the 591 episodes make themselves apparent, and that you can see over a decade of history looking around the world."
1,Love the terraforming work!
0,Move the well to the corner and use it for the grass farm?
0,hey ergo llamas go around sandy city
0,I like the un-unified world. It shows so much history and it's just a bit more fun than these perfectly orchestrated worlds. (Those are also impressive of course but for me give me less of that nostalgic Minecraft feeling.
2,"7:30 Whoa... not what I was expecting! I gotta say, my first thought when I saw that wall transitional mesa thing was that it reminded me of some sort of alien or diseased biome, encroaching on the desert and terraforming it into an ideal environment for a new form of life... 👽"
0,"ergo, my friend, my pal, your description says v1.25.1...!"
0,"Keep the desert well, it’s great and it makes sense to have a well nearby too"
0,Ty mr. slab!
0,"fun fact, you can do what  you did with the moss carpet with all carpet, I use it for floaties and stuff like that."
0,"Don't tear down the desert well! A big part of this world is it's long and storied history, with the combination of old and new builds. Working around decisions you made a decade ago is what makes it all unique"
0,You could rebuild the well to fit the style better
0,OH MY GOD ETHO WATCHES VERITASIUM
1,11:45 I think you could remove it and build something more fitting that is a tribute to it instead.
0,we also need to find out how You made the llamas walk around in Sandy City before episode 600
0,"WEEL: I would keep the well, but move it to slightly to open space."
0,That's nice!
1,Okay but how did etho get the llamas to walk around sandy city like that
0,"Keep the desert well, but maybe put an Etho twist on it."
0,That generation in the birch forest is nutty
0,Spam a bunch of those little tan ones to signify that the area is not used often and is overgrown
0,The firefly particles might work well as snowfall or kind of kicked up snow as well
0,don't remove old builds
374,The old trusty Etho/Bdubs video combo
0,Keep the desert well!
0,I am so excited because I loved the Better Biomes projects you did a while ago
0,I hate the orange wall thing.
0,Like christmas morning
0,System is down at work. Seems like it’s ergo time!
0,when you started the mesa terraforming i was not loving it but you convinced me by the end. it reminds me of the painted hills in oregon.
0,Gotta keep the well. That well killed me about 10 years ago😂
1,Pls don't tear down the well :(
1,the fireflies seem like they'd be pretty good for cave or old house dust. It's cool that they can be controlled with redstone
0,"the well is almost like the ugly brick thingy of the desert, keep it."
0,Where my snacks at?
30,"28:46 when the bush is hidden, during the day, the firefly particles kind of remind me of snow when it's just a light dusting"
0,Voting on keeping the desert well!!!! Even making some updates to it might make it fit better but keep the essence and history
0,Ethos desert update 👍
0,"Remember to bring your snacks to the Desert, it gets a bit sparse."
0,Hey Etho! Have you thought about returning to Pixlemon in any way?
204,"I’ll be honest, I wasnt sure about the tuff at first- but when you showed it fully landscaped I fell in love! it’s such a nice little highlight between blocks!

I’m so here for the etho learns landscaping journey 😂 its been so fun watching you go through trial and error with different blocks and placing styles 😊

thanks as always mr. slab!"
0,Maybe you can add some smooth red sandstone. Might help blend it a bit 🤷🏽‍♂️
1,When etho and bdubs sincronize their upload i know that im gonna have a good day
0,Keep the well!
0,Always good to see you in your LP world! I wonder if another block that might help with blending the badlands desert with the regular desert areas is stripped cherry wood. It'll bring in a little more of the red from the badlands into a color that's closer value-wise to the sand.
0,how did etho get sandy city to walk around the desert?
0,"Hey, Etho! I was looking at your subscriber count and it made me think about your YouTube play buttons. Do you display them in your home at all? Or do you just keep them tucked away in a closet or something? Anyways, thanks for all the years of content!"
70,"you asked about potentially removing the desert well - what if you just did a bit of a visual update to match the detail present in the area? i think personally the oddness of it is that it feels very early-Minecraft in style - because it is - while the rest of the area has clearly grown and evolved. adding some extra detail could solve that, plus maybe some extra plant life (dead or not, your choice) at the base, by virtue of it being a well. and maybe nudging it a block towards Sandy City, because it feels a bit crowded by the new terraforming, but that might be personal preference 😹

i'm always seated as soon as i see you've uploaded but these ""sprucing up the place"" and ""exploring for new features"" episodes will always be some of my favourites, i think. and the new items look so nice in your newly-terraformed area :')"
4,11:05 keep it! Or move it if you want
0,"I personally think you should relocate the lava well slightly further back, maybe adding more variation to the sandstone blocks aswell :)"
0,"Thanks for the video, it was excellent :]"
0,Should think about adding large sand drifts that are over taking some parts of the wall
235,"I'm here for you sprucing up the desert well, but it absolutely has to stay. That's a historical land mark, that is. Even if you swap out some of the blocks for updated ones to keep in line with new building doctrines, that lava well HAS to stay"
0,The Desert Well must remain!
1,never been this early
0,Etho how did you get the red sand to walk around sandy city like that
0,I say keep the desert well.
0,"you say it’s probably well known, not putting moss in water blew my mind too, i just got a ton of build ideas"
1,Keep the Well!
0,KEEP THE WELL
0,"I think the desert well is in a very good spot, maybe you could spruce it up a bit but I think it is a good place for a desert well of some sort.

I wasn't sure about the tuff at first, but you really pulled it all together with the foliage and red sandstone! Etho is picking up terraforming pretty quickly. I think the terracotta boulders create an excellent contrast for the desert.

Edit: Of course Etho immediately reinvents the cactus farm"
0,go get your snacks!!!
0,don't tear down the desert well!!
1,How did ergo get the llamas to walk around sandy city?
0,Some ppl do things..but MY WORLD doesn't...gotta love the Etho.
1,Personally I love nostalgia so I wouldn’t tear down the well
22,i had my doubts about the mini mesa but WOW it turned out better than I ever could've imagined
0,"A polishing episode on #591 because of #600 world tour and download ??? Woohoo!!

One thing I don’t remember being finished or not was moving the comments of the day to the library. I think that happened like 100 episodes ago but I can’t remember"
641,"Haven't watched the whole video yet, but I think your world does have a theme, and that theme is 'evolution'. We get to see how one person went about creating in Minecraft over more than a decade, as the game changed. It's historical. We don't get to see that anywhere else at this scale. So I hope you don't remove anything you've done in this world, for the sake of posterity."
0,"Hey etho I’m assuming you’ve seen the official shaders being added to bedrock, I’d guess you won’t ever use shaders on the lp, but when it comes to Java will you use it at all for newer series?"
1,The new terrain actually reminds me a lot of the prairie!! Red rock coulee in Alberta was the first thing I thought of!! It looks awesome and is definitely at the correct place in your world (at least in my opinion)
1,"Etho, the sandstone texturing and landscaping looks great. Also I wonder: if you could add any redstone component to minecraft, what would it be?"
41,I would say that you should keep the desert well. I loved the fact your world was booby trapped. And the desert well trap did get me tbh XD
0,❤ today is a good day! and getting close to another world tour!
0,I’m so happy
0,you can also place regular carpet on top of water. i used to use it to make silence footsteps hehe
0,ETHO!!!! Back so soon!!! Yayyyyy
0,Finally not a Hermitcraft video! \o/
0,keep ye olde desert well!!
1,Wait Etho I think you forgot to include the other 30 minutes of content 😢
1,"I say remove the old well and make a new one somewhere around the desert, then again the city has a well too doesn’t it? Maybe some cave connection via false well."
9,Never thought I’d see you work on that desert by the man cave. It’s been unchanged practically for 12 years
32,"If you keep pressing 3 on your keyboard you can make Etho say 'tobadouwee"" over and over again"
24,never been this early for an upload! 3am in the land down under right now and prepping for night shift tomorrow - cheers Etho for keeping me company tonight and throughout the years🫶🏻
0,"I think for the desert well, maybe remove it but replace it with a new well with your improved building skills. That way you keep some history, but don't have to compromise on aesthetics.

Love your vids, long time fan <3"
0,"Sunday evening, new Etho episode hot cocoa. Life is good."
2,"Since the Desert Well is such an old build, you could make it some sort of Ruin. Style it like the badlands around it.

Leave the bottom free of lava and make it a secret water source like some deserts have.

Edit: maybe add a campsite, make the area look lived in a bit maybe."
0,"No i like the well!!! Its cute!! And i think its funny that u tried to kill us.
Perhaps u could rebuild it to make it cuter since it doesn't fit with the vibe? But i like it :)"
0,"for the well, i'd say keep it or just move it a bit so it isnt in a jarring position"
0,keep the desert well! :D
2181,11:25 absolutely keep the well! It’s history. I’d say blend it in but let it stay. It reminds me of small scattered old ruins that are scattered around deserts
0,Snack time

0,"set aside the chores and homework, etho is here."
0,"I wonder if there’s a way to build up similar custom plants along the river to blend the desert and green river areas just beyond the walls. Instead of straight grassy areas with trees, using bushes, reeds, and of cat tail like grasses along the river bank to smooth out the transition."

0,10 years later and still here
0,"Since you mention ""dithering"", I don't know if you are aware but there's more interesting pixel-art concepts to be be applied to block placement in Minecraft like ""banding"" and ""pillowing"".

What do you do to help through tough times and rough mindset? You've dabbled into this before back on the old terrafirmacraft series but would like to know how you've evolved"

1,Yippee
1,Hi :D
1,i love you ethooooooo
1,"Twelve seconds!! :D

Edit: I feel like Etho is just someone whose good at Minecraft. Like he doesn't just specialize in one specific thing (I know redstone is big but you can't say he's not a builder or a terraformer at this point), he was making videos before the game even released, he's been building upon the same world for over thirteen years, I could go on! When you say the word 'Minecrafter' and try to think of what it actually means I think Etho just fits the description best"
1,hoooyeh
2,Godspeed etho
1,Love you etho

0,Etho you can do the same way JaidenAnimations does and have the fanart slowly pass at the end of the video. Check it out maybe you get some inspiration from her
1,22:45 BOBER!!
0,33:42 PEA... no that cant be right AAAAAHAHWHAHAHHHAHA
0,28:22 etho has a folder for fanarts he sees :)) this is v endearing to hear as an artist
0,the beaver 🦫 design made me giggle so much
0,The museum immediately reminded me of the Getty as soon as you walked up to it. Looks sick!
0,"31:27  ""16 is like a nice round number"" um, actually, its a nice SQUARE number (haha math jokes)"
0,"Way too late, but a comment on the rocks for future rock purposes:  When in moving water, the sides will be less curved than the top, because the river has worn then down over time. Taking off even one layer on the side will create a more ""cylinder-dome"" shape that is more natural"
0,23:38 If I were you sign up for aunty  Gem school for rocks terraforming she do a very good job of it.
0,"22:54 to be fair Etho some of us many people are fans of the hot beverage tea that over time the teeth gradually turn yellow some that use the cigarettes also have this issue of yellowish - brown teeth, I personally a a fan of tea so in all honesty to save myself to having to have a few trips to the dentist I personally won't have an issue of yellow shaded teeth especially if it is going to add strength to them, can't speak for everyone I won't have a problem, however if young and do have white teeth and do not use tea staining tea or maybe use that whitening chemical to make teeth white then nope would not what it, now other time and a fan of tea drinking I would not know a problem they going to be yellow anyways."
0,"Rivers naturally keep curving due to things such as sediment and erision until they hit themselves, in which an oxbow lake is formed. The curves that rivers have is the path of least resistance"
0,"I would Trade Up to Iron Infused Teeth, but I been a transhumanist since I first played Syndicate on the SEGA as a young boy."
0,"When thinking about creating rocks in Minecraft, definitely Bdubs at the top of the list and I also think of Grian! His main base and shop was all rocks so he'd also be a good person to ask about rocks"
1,"23:15 in a heartbeat- if that existed (and didn't come with health risks) then orange teeth would become the new attractive trait overtime- just in virtue of it signalling good health and therefor better genes and- you get the picture. but even jsut ignoring that, a lot of people who have been close to people with repeated teeth issues would, and people who are fanatic about their own health, and youtubers would advertise it via ""I Tried Recommended Toothpaste and it made my Teeth ORANGE"" or ""I tried xxx for 30 days"" - in other words, yeah, it's totally have its audience"
0,"i hate how slow your upload schedule is when i'm watching minecraft, but having not watched minecraft much recently the slow uploads is kinda nice because i dont have to watch 20 videos to catch up lol"
0,What do end crystals do
0,Me not wanting to finish the season 37:36
0,"Soooo, Etho's probably seen Hermitstuck, lol"
0,"rivers will meander as they encounter ANY friction, including a few extra pebbles that are stuck in the river bank, this will create a ""torque"" and softer soils will also erode faster than others

rocks also rarely are bare on top because soil gets deposited, plants grow on top, rocks crack and plants grow in those cracks, etc. all to have grassy foliage on top of the rocky surface

plants will even try to grow through asphalt"
0,People could submit that you can use their art in your videos when they send it to you.
0,The hermits are loving waterfalls this season! Its so cool to see all the different styles you all come up with
0,One thing that helps me in making rivers is remembering that rivers (generally) follow the path of least resistance
0,Dude I love your ideas for like a beaver dam and the falling dmg game in the next episode. So cool :D great to see this season back cause I was following and suddenly it stopped that was a bit sad. Great to see you guys are back!!
0,"It's so cool seeing so many of the hermits try branching out from their main ""Minecraft player archetype"" to try different things and learn more from each other."
0,"The artwork in the museum is AMAZING. Especially the Decked Out related ones gave me goose bumps, oh boy the memories of that time came rushing back. Great job everyone who sent in fanart!"
0,"I have a thing call flourosis which makes tooth enamel harder and more resistant to cavities. It causes spots and yellowing, kinda like a beaver lol. It really didn't help that I had buck teeth too 😂"
0,"15:42 add water. That will give you a visual to work with, and will also change how much and what type of shading you need.

16:49 I spoke too soon."
0,"I’ve been watching him since my early teens I’m now 24 this man is still a legend can’t believe the vibe hasn’t changed props, ❤"
0,"As a Kakashi and Etho fan in equal measure, Etho fanart goes so hard"
0,17:37 Terraforming canon event
0,Love the beavers and idea of their enviroment ❤
0,"If you wanna show off fanart in the videos, like DocM does, why not have a Discord server or email where people can send their art if theyre ok with it being displayed? That way you get to share it with the community and promote the artists, while also being 100% sure people have consented to their art being displayed 

Although i guess obnoxious people could submit art that isnt theirs"
0,Love the kakashi hatake skin
0,"Bdubs is a genius, if it comes to immersion and scenic views."
0,"etho terraforming and bdubs making farms, what a time. I need more !!!"
0,"I was thinking that campfires may help add some detail to the top of the beaver dam.  Also, your terraforming and building in general has really come a long way, it's looking really good."
0,"I remember watching a video about how rivers curve because they were already slightly less curved, so the rocks aren’t completely necessary"
0,"your building scenes are my favortites! im not into redstone, but love your exictuions. you are an artist in many forms"
0,kakashi?
1,Etho will never know what happened 💔
0,Jenna
2,"for the rocks: this feels weird to say but there might be too much blending. I think you need more contrast?  with pearl's rocks, there's a bit spiky, so you see the difference with the values a bit better 

+ sometimes the non-stone blocks can register as a bit weird with stone. cause subconsciously you know it isn't stone. mb add a bit of regular stone between the tuff n gravel and stuff and the concrete powder and wool? dunno if the warm/cool value of the regular stone matches up though"
1,"Give me the orange teeth and i would chuck wood, like the woodchuck"
1,bro I just hopped in this video and its been like  10-12 years since I last watched Etho back in highschool. I was surprised he's still using the same Intro after all these years. It's like watching my childhood again. I watched him so many times as a kid I know hes using the same exact intro
1,Just wanna say I absolutely loved watching your videos as a kid. I was in elementary school at the time and now I'm fresh out of college. Thank you Ethos! Words can't explain the nostalgia.
0,Ethos such a cheeky dude
1,"Late comment is probably invisible, but ... I'm not sure if knowing that Etho hoards his fanart to hard drive makes me feel better about also doing that, or worse."
0,"So in real life, rivers actually curve and bend and meander naturally, and those curves and bends change slowly overtime.  This is because there's a natural element of randomness to how the terrain erodes.  If you see a straight river in real life, that means that humans have messed with it to keep it from ruining their property, and to prevent it from flooding.  And like many things humans do, that's bad for the environment.  A straight river is a dead river."
0,You need higher darker points and spots of darkness
0,Your intro reminds me of f11shstance - when I look up from a fishing spot and everyone around me are ducks!
1,Building nature scenes always drives me crazy because there's so many details you can add but then you step back and it's almost not noticeable
0,"I feel like the rocks in the river are odd, because they're boulders so they probably need a separate color palette compared to the river wall rocks. I just like placing boulders in places so I'm not sure what the fix is exactly, but I think they're just missing some slight separation."
0,"4:17 so true, respect for Doc for pulling it off with ease, while being a ""fluffy"" goat inside."
0,15:22 it looks good rocks also have specks of other colors. Rock On!
0,"Bit late so doubt you will see this, but as someone who grew up on a rocky river, when rocks are in  a river, you need to inverse the texture, water smooths the rock out, so anything underwater should be a smooth texture, and then rougher textures above the waterline.

Then also the layer that is at water hight can be much darker than the layer above, rather than a smooth transition, wet rock is dark and dry rock is pale (making several assumtions about what type of rock ""stone"" is in minecraft), this can be used to show where water ""splashes"" like on the outside of a bend or around a waterfall, by having darker spots above the water line.

It looks great! But maybe just some things to consider for your next rock river project as you do care about the ""real world reason""."
0,can you show us a full showcase of the house it looks reaaally good
1,I love the beaver dam ecosystem idea! The beavers look really good and the river looks great so far! 😄
0,Just got done watching Doc's latest episode. Can't wait to see you play his new game!
0,white rocks might be cool
1,"I come from an alternate universe where Etho Uploads weekly! and compared to this dreary place, its a paradise!"
0,"Thanks Etho ❤ 

Love the beaver!"
0,Go get your snacks!
0,Damn Etho you did a really good job with that museum area! The colored blocks you chose all did a fantastic job of making the artwork pop! It adds a lot of beautiful color to the space without taking away from the art. My kudos!!

0,Ethoooo
1,"Hey Etho wasn't sure what video to post this on but some ideas I think your fans would like

1. use classic textures on your LP world but modern textures elsewhere, your primary singleplayer is a nostalgia series and the new textures ruin the feel

2. don't wait so long to post 1 big video, but rather do like you used to, daily / bi-weekly videos of smaller more relaxing content of just you playing, mining, building, etc."
0,"I know this is older video at this point, so likely won't be seen by Etho, also i stopped to type this at the 14 minute mark, sorry you already do this later in the video, You can use the darker shade in the line of stone for the watery parts, as it would make the stone look wet."
0,im ngl i was half expecting him to punch an end crystal at the outro when he did the whole f5 -> punch/wave goodbye thing
0,<3 u etho
0,Wow haven’t watched a video in years decided to look you up and I was very surprised to see you still posting hermitcraft vids. They were always some of my favorite along with the redstone videos. Glad to see you still at it man!
0,I think the rocks before you added any shading was a lot better. I think less is more when it comes to environments.
0,"I love the terraforming exploration! Things are going well. I think the key for Rocks that I have found is to give them volume. It's hard to do rocks and have it follow ""typical"" Minecraft generation. But giving it a rounder shape is good.

The Beavers are PERFECT with no lever legs!! They look AMAZING! Maybe blackstone for the eyes might work? This was an awesome episode!"
0,2 weeks in between episodes
0,I hope to see wadzee on hermitcraft one day
0,"ive been super curious, what's the redstone for the crafters you have on your storage walls. you used to have the redstone componnents, and i wanted to make one too in my world."
0,"Etho: i build to make things look good. Im not really into making things look real

Also etho: we need boulders in this river to make it look real!"
0,"That fanart is gorgeous! I love how the frames complement the artworks perfectly, truly this community is so talented and I’m so glad people are coming together to appreciate the Slab Man"
0,"I loved the free glass prank in Season 7! My first season of watching Hermitcraft! Thank you for the videos Etho, it’s always nice to come back to an episode during my lunch break :) love your terraforming too!"
0,Etho was slightly on minecraft live!
0,"26:30 ""fox in my berries"" out of context sounds so inappropriate"
0,Thanks for posting this etho. I know I’m a little late but I have been going through it and this just makes me feel like I’m a kid again. Thank you man❤️
0,"Etho i LOVE the lake, even undecorated it reminds me of a trail in the mountains my family goes to every so often. I think if you added a dirt trail, cradled in trees and undergrowth, maybe a dock/boat ramp on the far side, it would be beautiful!

Of course, its your build, the lake just brought a vivid image of the lake i know in real life, now that its spring im gonna have to drag my family up there again. 

My suggestion with the river is to maybe lower the water level; yes rivers change direction because of changes in the landscape, but it also changed simply because of erosion and what the ground is made of. Most flowing rivers and streams are carving away in canyons or ditches, and you have to walk down steep ground to reach them, so they more follow the shape of the land. Boulders dont need to shape every curve, maybe theres just a hill with more tree roots holding the dirt in place in the way!

Looking forward to future episodes, as always. hope youre doing well and good luck with future projects!!"

0,"Yo Etho, you make me want to continue playing Minecraft again but the issue is, I have a realm with a friend but it’s laggy. Is there anyway to fix that. We have add on’s but been reading Realms a laggy in general"
0,"Even as I've aged out of the game itself as so many of Etho's longtime viewers have, Etho still manages to make engaging content. For me it's the beaver stuff in this video, and the light shading in the previous episode. He always seems to find a way to keep it interesting!"
0,How would the River look if the water were diagonal as it went down a layer? You would have to make the water layer underneath non-source blocks.
0,"It's always a question... Who owns it anyway, does this count as a derivative work and if so, do you own it? They are not violating to your rights if posting it with permission but idk who would own it without it being explicitly stated"
0,Hey Etho! You could try and put spruce or dark oak buttons on the dam. It would add some texture but not create chaos. Cheers!
0,"I mean Most rocks in rivers usually have seaweed on them. Mossy cobblestone kinda thing, yeah?"
0,"Rivers in Minecraft kinda just appear.
Would be nice with like a high up lake that the river flows from. Maybe a cave that the water drains in to before flowing on
edit: beaver d*mn is a very good idea!
edit edit: And what a great idea with a lake! =D"
0,"10:20 That can be it too! But the way the rivers curve, is due to the currents eating their banks. So it eventually curves so much, that it ""snaps""! Then the whole process starts again. Its really interesting"
0,I can imagine Etho got inspired with IRL beaver dam he's got near his house in the woods
0,"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ETHOLAB, I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOUR VIDEO FOR 7+ YEARS YOU ARE THE BEST 🦾"

0,Don’t let’s post 10 near the beaver dam
0,You should take the shopping district police to court and try to get the end crystal permit removed as it is not an item that people are buying enmasse.
0,"Rivers actually curve on their own in time. The water flows to the edge of the river and knock loose some dirt and small rocks. That makes the other side of the river shallow and the other deep. Also in time when the river is really curvy, the water finds the path of least resistance and skips over the curve and creates a C-shaped lake."
0,Never seen Etho so self aware about avoiding work 😂 it was like the theme of the episode 🤣
0,Stone and Andesite stairs and slabs are the secret to terraforming stone stuff. you can do lots of details with them like little cracks and holes.
0,23:15 I would without a second thought.
0,"The beaver dam was a great idea, and the beaver is amusing =) Lol at using the POE building as your shop =P"
0,"I'm about four days late and not entirely done with the video but I think an important thing with the rocks is: If you want them to look like rocks, stray away from messier textures at the top. Wool and concrete powder look like wool and concrete powder even next to water. Best to stick with messier textures that you choose only for color in darker areas that will not well-seen (i.e. near the bottom of the river). thats just my opinion though"
0,Rock ideas: keep the rocks smooth at the bottom where the river has eroded them; and make the rocks up top rough. I think that's where your distaste for the concrete looking tops comes from?
278,"""16 is a nice round number""  spoken like a  true computer"
0,wow i haven’t watched an etho video in forever and holy he sounds so different now!
1,"I watched a video about rivers, and basically they curve because they are too fast, so they start eroding their own banks until they create a curve."
2,"Wow I got recommended an ethos video in 2025 after years, finally yt algorithm is doing something right"
0,"Yo. the rocks. dont make so many and dont make them so small. Its better to maybe make one or two bigger, 'feature' rocks. Like... go bold. 
I'd recommend using some reference materials too, it'll really help you visualise and pull off an idea and choose the right blocks too cos itll work kinda like a palette too. Personally i use the word 'fantasy' when searching for reference material cos it tends to give lots of art / painted concepts which can often be a lot more visually appealing than real photos."
0,24:46 Did that make you juuuump?
0,See you next month etho
0,Add trees near the river to have the roots as a transition between the different colored rocks
0,Make a dragon killing challenge so the people want the items to spawn the dragon
0,10:10 not sure that the curvature of the river is caused by rocks... but an expert can explain how it is caused by sediment.
0,How are you gonna make a beaver and not get Gem’s opinion on it?
0,I just designed a ghast tear farm and it was an awful failure. Thanks for showing me a better option!
0,Miss you etho boo
0,I think the rocks lining your river are too high. You might have some sections of the river where at the bend the less erodible material is visible but frequently it isn't visible. You might walk on moss right up to the edge and then realize there are rocks under you. I think you'll like the look of it more if there only a couple of spots with tall rocks.
3,"Etho: I don't know anything about art

Also Etho: *designs a perfectly adorable and functional gallery space off camera*

I've been doing some rock texturing myself recently, and something I've found is that you can definitely get too textured. It helps to have a base block that you're texturing from, as the main block in whatever you're building. For rocks, that should be the type of stone, be it Stone, Andesite, Netherrack, whatever. Having smooth central pieces of that main stone gives focus points for the eye, and stops you from ending up with what just looks like grey dirt"
0,"Another fantastic episode, as always."
0,"Whenever I see anything on Hermitcraft that vaguely resembles cult-like behavior I'm automatically like ""mmm.... Cub was somehow involved in this"" 😂"
0,"since the surrounding  area of the river is super green, incorporating more nature-y and more green blocks in the rock area would look nice i think,. and vise versa, since you want the rocks on the surface of the river, maybe incorporate more rocky blocks in the grass areas. if that makes sense. i think either way would create a nice blend of the gray/green colors... also the beavers are absolutely amazing!"
0,1 video per month is crazy
0,"on the fanart thing, you could have a specific tag that would let you know which fanart is ok to feature in videos? and then link to the artists in the description.

the river came out so good honestly!!! would not be able to tell you havent done terraforming often"
0,HE LIIIIIIIIVVVVESS! 😂
0,"Etho, I don't think anyone would go for the orange teeth since I'm pretty sure our teeth should be able to handle 30k pounds of pressure and they have been weakening in recent history because we aren't eating tougher raw meats anymore"
0,"10:15 Did you know: Rivers meander on their own. If there is even a slight disturbance somewhere the water will have to flow around it, the speed of the flow on the other side picks up and washes away more ground. So the bends in a river become more and more extreme until they form a full loop and the river cutzs through to straighten out. Thats how the horseshoe lakes around rivers come to be.

So there doesnt really need to be a reason."

0,"I remember when Etho wanted to make shorter videos at the start of the season...
Not that im complaining!

0,"Bdubs gifting you ""some grass"" and its only short grass is so funny and fitting for a short man"
0,Maybe the Poe needs more advertisement in case they don't recognise your creative shop efforts
0,Ask Cleo to help you make a armorstand beaver on the dam
0,"I've always wanted to have flowing water be a thing. I mean water that is directional when on a horizontal plane, instead of having to drop elevation to get movement. Rivers would be so much better if you could have a flow to them."
0,I think the rocks should be less bouldery. Less like lots of little blobs that looks a bit odd to me. What if they flowed into one another more
10,"Usually large rivers like that have a lot of erosion and very large rock beaches instead of grass next to large boulders. I would recommend lowering the water level, and have the lush plant-life overhang off of the edges of the river."
0,Love the beaver!!
0,It’s crazy the amount of views he gets yet his channel never grows
0,"I'm not a builder, but I have a process suggestion. Etho, you showed the blocks you considered in air at 13:34. To pick out underwater blocks, shouldn't you dig a big two block hole and put building blocks in the bottom, water on top?


And those beavers are a masterpiece!!!!"
1,"Great terraforming, love the beaver dam!"
0,"I really like the damn, both in concept and execution"
0,"Don't they technically relinquish the rights to the art when they send it to you as fan art, so if you want to show it off you're allowed I don't think you can replicate it and claim it as your own"

0,"Boy you can tell Etho is from Canada lol
So much time spent on beavers"
0,"I love your videos etho, i wait for em and make full arrangements when you upload.
Tablet instead of a phone, highest quality, window shutters down, fan slowed for better audio, full volume, snacks, door shut etc. I wish that you uploaded more frequently but it is awesome that the vids last long so it feels like a movie and one forgets everything else for ~an hour."
0,I can't believe I've never seen someone make a beaver dam in MineCraft.
5,"Watching someone like Scar or Pearl do ""just a little terraforming"" is like watching Mumbo do ""really quite simple Redstone"". Watching Etho terraforming still looks great but feels down to earth for a pleb for me ❤️"

0,for  detailing the beaver dam maybe try dead bushes or campfires
0,I'd take the orange teeth. And if people give me a hard time about it they can kiss my shiny metal face.
0,"Hey Etho, could you create a clock on an enderpearl stasis chamber for as long as you were gonna play that day (say 6 hours) so no matter what happens, even if you get exiled, you’ll get brought back to your base at the end of your session"
0,Please do a create playthrough
1,Please don't judge rocks too harshly :D
0,"i dont know if you'll see this but i think the river side has too much rock, normal rivers usually do not contain so much rocks and sometimes sandy sides opposite of the rocks due to the corrosion of the rocks and when they hit another rock they slow down and place to the opposite end of the river."
1,Try iron ore with the rocks or copper
1,you should build a shop for beavertails
0,Beaver dams have an entrance underway. Wonder if Etho can do a mock version of an entrance?
0,"You should build a geode shop, covers all of your stones and your end crystals don’t need their own whole shop"
0,"End crystal shop idea if yours becomes compromised : make a ghast out of blocks and a dropper with the crystals so it shoots out the crystals they buy. Simple 3-5x construction, maybe make the eyes of the ghast from end crystals to advertise."
0,"""End crystals are super low demand"" lol mumbo laughs in season 8"
0,"DUDE, beavers alllll the wayyyyy! Let's see if we can convince Minecraft to make them a standard critter!!"
0,"I am surprised Etho believes there isn’t a demand for this when there was an entire bit a season or so ago blowing people up with end crystals. I could see a war sparking between the POE and NO POE factions and anyone selling weapons (End crystals, charged creepers, mobs, firework crossbows etc.) would make bank as arms dealers 😂"

0,"Epic video Etho! 

I'm not artist nor do I play the game, but regarding the river rocks: I feel in parks and such when you're walking along rivers you don't generally see much by the way of boulders along the shores (at least sticking up like that). 

I can think of places where you might during ""rapids"" / when the river is descending quite a bit. (Plus consider that you're going through a ""field"" with the river, so the only place where boulders are are in the river. I think that contributes to them being unnatural because a river would take the path of least resistance. ie run through soil, not rocks. 

I think it's much more common for there to be trees, with roots being what keeps the shore line up against where the water is.

Not sure if this will help, but FYI the build looks great even if you're critical of it, loving it :)"
0,Invisible item frame with stairs or slabs for the legs of the beaver!
0,"Not all river influencing is natural.
On the build side, there could be some retaining walls helping shape and define.
Also, some rocks will be eroded below the waterline, don't slope everything back."
0,"Maybe add some leakage to the dam so the river has a ""reason"" to flow. With the waterfall at the end the river would be empty in no time"
0,"Bdubs tries to use the contrast in shades to add depth rather then using depth to add shade.

This could help you with the texturing abit :))

Try comparing it to pixel art or painting"

0,Create the demand for end crystals. I think a crystal based game is in order.
0,Love you etho
0,Etho there a mod I believe add Cat tails and decorative Items as well as new mud block If your Makeing a beaver dam for your river add some Tall grass and Rocks log with mushrooms to give the idea of the bank being old and Woody
2,I’ve watched Etho for over a decade and still look forward to every upload <3
0,"you should mix in some other colors to the boulders, maybe some brown or if you can a washed out blue or green, maybe even some rare but occasional yellow. mostly grey but you know add some diverse color tones to it to break up the monotony. if you're gonna add green or yellow or red , what ever color scale from grey to the selected color. also consider how you imagine the sunlight is hitting the stones, this way you can but some consistency where the lighter colors should go. like if there is shady trees near by, those stones would appear several shades darker then the ones in direct sunlight. idk food for thought."
0,Terraforming rivers with TNT is too much fun. It also gives the river a very natural shape. You’ve done it again. Thank you for the great idea!!
0,It's a shame this isn't season 8 lol. Peace Love and Plants Potato Jumbo would be buying up end crystal stock 😂
0,"Etho, you did finish a project in one video from start to end!
The ghast farm, the End crystal shop, the museum decorations.

As for not showing the full process in one video, I think it just gives the series a good  sense of continuity! The audience gets a little taste of the idea in one video, then they look forward to future videos. And they also get to play around with the idea in their own minecraft worlds for awhile until you show it in a future episode. (hopefully not years later )"

I just wanted to leave this comment here to say thank you for making these videos, I am glad that you still like playing Minecraft and making videos after all these years. You are a huge inspiration to me and many others and will probably be a well known name for all of history given Minecraft’s great uniqueness that you embrace so well!"

0,Add some sand to the river?
0,My hot take is that ‘shading’ at that scale doesn’t look great. Especially using blocks like wool. IMO it reverses any ‘immersion’ that the shading would bring. Could just me be though I’ve been a hater of that building style since day 1.

0,IMHO Wool one is to bright for the rocks
0,"The art was SOOOOO cool
Amazing job everyone"
1,"I thought of some ideas to make the river more alive idk if that makes sense😂… but anyways I think if you add level changes at the edge of each turn (considering the current of the water flow in the river) to create a sense of motion.

Now this motion would create an upstream which is more polished due to erosion (meaning smoother/polished rocks so basically lighter colors) and the downstream side of it would be darker as it tends to gather dirt and moss. 🫶🏻"
0,I think the pale moss gives the rocks too much of a grainy texture maybe some dead coral or more stone blocks
0,Would never have guessed that your free glass prank would’ve cause you so much stress!!! You surely brought so much spice to s7!!!!

0,I am worried for Canada now. 😢
0,"Rivers and water in general tend to flow along the path of least resistance, which means they twist and curve around obstacles such as rocks, hills, trees, and other geological features. 
Your boulders are massive



And the rocks along your river are comically large compared to the size of your river, so they stand out quite a bit. Also, having one of those big rocks located at every single bend and curve in the river further clutters your landscape around the river. Additionally, the block palette you've used for your rocks doesn't really integrate into the rest of your landscape, so they pop visually. 

You could decrease the size of the rocks, maybe choose a different palette for them, and use different geological features to force the river to bend so it's not all just big rocks around a shallow river."
0,"Etho, a suggestion for the nook in the art gallery:  that nice open space in the middle of the carpet is a good place for a long bench to sit on to admire the art for longer."
0,Does etho post videos outside of YouTube? Cause sometimes he talks about stuff he did that I had no idea about
0,"A cool idea you could do to flesh out your river a little more is to put blocks under where the water flows, so when the water is going to the next block down its not a straight line, and then remove the blocks of course. Basically flatten out the height changes"
0,ITS A ETHO!
0,"Rocks shear honestly and I think that may be what is missing. I see large rounded clumps which looks man made, but a more natural feel is rock layering and then shearing where you often get shelves or cliffs depending on how it 'sheared'. That may give you a concept to run with and see how it feels."
0,"I like watching your videos because you DON’T follow the tried and true tested YouTube video format.  I hate it.  Everyone copies each other, and it’s all so fake.  ❤"
0,You should make the bigger rock granite because it is one of the harder stones
0,"Hey Etho, for your rock problem, it might be a texture issue. Most rocky rivers are smooth with layers. I think you might have added too much texture.
I like the green rock you did, but I think if you want to add red rocks you might want to add more than one. 
You could also try some yellow? Maybe add some as sediment near the water edge to show the water breaking the rocks? (also if you add some sand under the water near the bends, it will add a little pop for when you are looking at the water."
0,I’m sure NOTHING will happen with those crystals he placed!
0,For the waterfall you should check out Jake Kelton Crafts's video about using piston feedtapes and redstone to add motion to a build. I saw that video after watching the fan one which inspired Mumbo and was wondering who was using waterfalls but it would be a perfect place!
157,"Rock feedback: I liked the final look of the rocks the most, and I think it's because the textures closest to you are the ""natural"" ones (actual stone materials). Wool and concrete powder and stuff are great for shading at a distance, but up close they look odd and out of place."
0,Hey Etho. Can i recommend something? Maybe make a booru and have a specific tag people can add if they would be okay with their art appearing in episodes.
0,"Man, the jingler card straight up spoiled that mystery for me lol. I never knew it was Cub. I wasn't super into the lore, i just knew about it and wasn't sure who it actually was. The first time I saw that card, i was straight up like ""dang..."""

0,etho why do you know so much about beavers?
0,"Do you have to charge diamonds at your end crystal shop? If you make the price end rods or eyes of ender, or even glass, then your shop would become a lot more sustainable.

0,Beaver dams! Genius idea. And I think I'm a convert to river building with TNT. And your new shop is perfectly located.
0,"For the rocks it may be worth putting some noticeably darker blocks at the waterline to make the edges look wet. And since the underwater sections are hard to see, you're only getting a third of your colour range above the water so that might take some shifting too. The mossy rock is a great step though, definitely the best looking one of the bunch. I wonder if the intense greens and saturated colours of the surrounding build might see more benefit from darker rocks, but then you couldn't use that amazing pale moss tech, which is adding a lot of detail."

0,22:37 That is one chonky beaver.  Aren't minecraft blocks supposed to be one meter cubed?

0,"Beavers are gradually being reintroduced in some parts of England's countryside, and some parts of Europe as part of natural flood prevention, etc.  A bit of lichen will break up some of the same rock areas, whole not changing texture too much, for variation.

0,Funny how the sweetest membest take over the vilain role
0,"A bit of feedback on rocks by the river: Think about real rocks by rivers. Most river rocks are worn smooth on the inside (facing the river) by the river and flood periods rushing water. They're often a single type of rock per big boulder, so mixing rock types (for instance, andesite and stone) might look odd compared to just mixing shapes, but there's often a decent number of big boulders per river, so you can still get that variation along the banks -- kinda like you did later in the video (like around 23:00). I'd say, past that, think about silt/depositions, adding gravel and tuff as more sandy/silty sort of material that gets added on the sides and along the bank due to the river dropping the silt stuff off as it goes past -- put bigger piles at curves where the water would pile up and lost momentum, even momentarily, and less at straightways where the water can more easily pick up the particulates. Then, finally, no wool -- why would there be wool in a rock where no sheep/fluffy animals are nearby? Trade out that material for some other gray material, or mix in brown wool for it to reflect the beaver fur being washed around."

0,Thanks for making my day and uploading a new hc video
0,beaver details!
0,I think the rocks look good maybe what’s missing is the blending into the dirt. It’s a harsh line at the moment maybe mossy cobble and other blocks to blend. Bdubs used some warped block (can’t remember what block exactly) to add these highlight bright teal pops that are so good.
0,You say out of your element but real life experience of nature is definitely helping you. Definitely can tell the outdoors is in your wheelhouse.

0,"I like seeing you experiment with things you don't have much experience with! My personal suggestion would be to have the water lower.

0,"Hey etho, rivers curve naturally, constantly, by virtue of physics at play. The sides of rivers (in contact with the riverbed/things in the riverbed) move slower than the center, which inevitably causes curving, and rivers constantly curve back and forth along whatever natural plane they've happened upon. Over time they wiggle back and forth at grand scale. You can virtually arbitrarily curve rivers any way you want as long as they're realistically scaled curves.

Having a narrative isn't bad though, just letting you know for future terraforming, rivers are neat and like to dance around."
0,"Month of December, classic Etho."
0,When artists put artwork online on a reddit does that not imply they want it visible? Makes no sense to me they would put it there and not want it spread. In my opinion if you put it publicly online it's free game. As long as you don't try to sell it as your own of course.

0,"Rivers tend to curve more on flat lands, because of the way the sediment it carries from the mountains deposits on one side more than the other to cause the stream to be pushed out, so it would be more logical (but maybe not as pretty) to have a more Gravel based obstacle in the curve of the River"
0,"The free glass prank wil for ever be my favorite prank. When people ask me wat HC is, i tell them about shade-e-e's"
0,Bober? Does he bite?
0,"Showing someone's fanart isn't violating their rights if you stay within fair use.  Commentary and critique purposes are covered under fair use.  If you are showing the art and *explaining* why you liked it, what lead you to pick it, that is perfectly legitimate.  Things like commenting on how you like the lighting effects on the shoe.  Including it in the *world download* was the much more difficult area that required doing things to cover legal issues."
0,Also self sharpening teeth due to being more iron rich in the front.
0,Ah yes the new end crystals shops is totally not going to create ANY problem
2,"I honestly actually prefer the way you do things. Starting new projects every 5 seconds. It makes it fun! And we get to see you actually doing the things you enjoy and are thriving on!

When you enjoy playing the episodes are more enjoyable to watch. 

So I prefer when you don’t finish things hahaha"
0,i didn't expect to learn so much about beavers today ! really like the level of detail and i think the beavers look quite cute €0:
0,I would 100% trade white teeth for orange teeth
0,If you don't add a waterfall secret elytra entrance into the lower levels of your base I'll be deeply disappointed
0,The day Etho and Chris smoove stop uploading on yt I’m done for 😅
0,I like your new shop. I can tell you put a lot of time and effort into building it xD
0,"Bdubs hooked him up, that must be a few pounds of grass at least."
0,"Re: Permits:  Go the malicious compliance route... make the shops.  Stock them with one item for sale.  Set the price at 12,000 diamonds per 1 item.  Your shop will be made, it will be stocked, and you will never have to restock it 😂"
0,"Hey Etho! Love the dam and the 🦫 s.  They normally build the den separately from the dam right? Might be an interesting addition. ""The Beaver Dam"" hideout?"
0,I would 100% trade my teeth (not perfectly white) for stronger orange teeth.
0,Maybe on the beaver dam some armor stands holding sticks or saplings poking out would help sell the beaver dam aspect.
0,19:18 The month of December… We need Etho hitting that record button more
0,"4:15 I'm not a huge fan of the villain drama-type stuff, but then again the free glass prank didn't come across as especially villainous, if only because nobody had to actually watch anyone going through all the chests of free glass and emptying them out. If we did have to experience it ourselves however, then maybe it'd be villainous and tedious and frustrating and all those bad things, but since we didn't it just seemed funny and entertaining. I'm mostly just here for the cooperation, cool builds, and funny interactions."
0,10:02 rivers will also get bends due to sediment deposit. Fast flowing water brings gravel and sand and then drops it down stream. This causes buildups that change the flow of water and naturally it diverts the path of the water. Oxbows are an example of this effect.
0,"The beaver is so cute!  Great idea to do the beaver dam; I haven't seen anything like that Minecraft, and it looks dam good."
0,You need to help or start a war like Grian does usually.  Or prank their beds and ender pearl stasis chambers
0,"You built a pile of rocks, it sounds like you wanted a boulder"
0,Build some beavers also
0,When making rocks it’s best to use just regular stone and andesite or gravel. While using stones utilize the half slabs and stairs
0,I would have orange teeth if they would be stronger! It is a pretty big fear of mine to shatter a tooth.
0,"Etho large “detailed” boulders would actually be amazing, idk if you’ve ever rock climbed, a bouldering environment/crag would look great around the lake. If you’re not too sick of rocks already 😁"
0,"So I know for creeks, the sides are a ton or dirt and mud; not alot of rock/boulders. So I’d say lose some of the rocks on the side and have exposed tree roots because those are typically what causes the shift in direction."
0,White teeth for the win!
0,PEA... WHAT DOES PEA MEAN ETHO.... ETHHOO?
2,"Etho, you need more boulders peaking out of the ground around your base. If you want everything to have a logical flow, why does only the place where the river happened to flow have boulders that reach up above the ground level. It would make more sense to have the occasional stone patches in the ground by your pace to set a tone that there are a lot of rocks right under the surface. Because right now it is like those boulders only exist to serve the river, but have no natural explanation."
0,That’s me guys 26:20
1,Etho could you please put some running water through the beaver dam? :)
0,For your rocks in the river since you have specific rocks for all the bends you should try shading different rocks a different shade then the one next to it. Could make each rock stand out a little more and create a gradient across the river so the stone tops won't seem as bland
2,"Rivers naturally meander over time; they don't need a boulder or rock to create a winding shape. Difference in water speed cause natural erosion and deposition, which over time forms meanders. You can see this process when looking at the difference in young, mature, and old rivers. Creating a meandering river with different river speeds and flows that form cut banks and point bars would look realistic and really cool!"
0,I did not expect to hear Etho talking about wet beavers today.
1,4:13 I think it's very interesting that Etho sees himself as a villain on hermitcraft.
0,"EXCELLENT video. The quick tcg explanation was just enough for me, the teraforming process exclamation was informative, soooo much variety of content, and beaver facts! Loved it (ps i personally def vote for more mossy inserts on/around the river rocks)"
1,"Rocks by water are smooth at top, because running water flattens and smooths out stone. Have you ever seen a river stone from the river bed?"

0,That ending.  XD     Oh god I've missed these episodes.
0,I do not think anyone would say your videos are getting long. absolutely love watching your videos!!!
0,So happy to see a new video!
0,"love you and missed the vids, never stop and hope this year has been treating you right"
0,"If you really want to be Exile proof, I did think of a easy way. Details after the fold.





Setup a stasis chamber attached to a timer. Have the timer be for something like 8+ hours. Setup 2 buttons  in your base. First button chunkloads and starts the timer. Second button stops and resets the timer. It's a basic UnalivedMans Switch. Now all you have to do is hit the first button when you log in and the second before you log out (or get close to the max time).

Now if you get exiled, you just wait and eventually you get sent to your bunker."

0,Etho casually threatening the whole server with end crystals spread around the shopping district is wild

0,"Prince Etho Returns! 

So glad to have you back on Hermitcraft and posting! I’m absolutely in love with the idea of you terraforming stuff, though I know how hard it is. My first few years that I’ve tried never really succeeded, and im working on it to this day. As for the cute little beaver? Omg! Adorable! 

Also, that’s so you to say that you’d try to avoid the POE (permit office enforcement) and then just smack down a shop in the middle of their office 😆 😭

Always a pleasure to watch,
Your proud Ethogirl"
0,what is the autocrafter design around the storage room?
0,The bever is perfect. Saw a chubby one cross the road today up in the Yukon. You dont really see the legs when they're tucked under a fat butt
1,i just want to beaver to know that they are so loved
0,I believe Scar gave over the interior work to Skizz for the POE POE station which is why there is only a crazy elevated table for them to meet at in there.  Love seeing your process and hard work on the river rocks!  Absolutely love the beaver dam idea!  Very unique and very Canadian eh?

0,I'm sorry this is how you have to find out but there's no such thing as a beaver.  A beaver is just a backwards platypus...  the platypus conspiracy is all I could think about the whole time you were talking about beavers.

4,"Dear etho, as well as anyone reading, (question later on what’s your favorite native plants and animals, native could mean local, state or nation you live in.) 

I love the beaver dam idea, also how Canadian lol. I’m a big fan of supporting beaver habitat expansion in the United States, we have a lot in Minnesota but they used to be much more prolific here and across the continent. Fur hats and all that, they also can be a nuisance to people flooding roads and fields and whatnot. 

Slowing water from point a to point b is an important principle in habitat and eco restoration. It’s the fundamental key in restoring decertified land, like the desert forest of Shaun Overton’s Dust Ups Ranch here on YouTube. 

Hence why I’m such a fan of beavers, their outsized positive impact on the natural world they inhabit. Also that they use their ponds and lakes over winter as refrigerators to keep their veg fresh and I think that’s cute.

My question is to you etho, if you see this is, what are some of your favorite local, or nationally local native plants and animals? And why?

For instance I love that wintergreen is native to mn, it’s a treat to stumble apon and taste such a fresh ubiquitous flavor growing native and wild. And Minnesota wild rice is so tasty. I love the look of smooth hydrangeas, it’s rare to see native perennial flowers used in landscaping here, but it’s getting more common. My brother is a landscaper, sharing the love of the natural world I have, he constantly teaches me
About different plants, how they grow and how to identify. His work sends him to a lot of conventions and sometimes he takes me.

Trees like the white pine are also incredibly beautiful, and the prefect places for eagle and bard owl nests. Pine martens and Fishers are cool, I think they are some of the few animals that successfully predates on porcupines. But what I’m really excited for in the next few weeks and coming spring months are our chorus frogs, I cannot wait to have my window open for them sing me to sleep, their choir drowning out the highway near by and seemingly the whole world. So when I sit out on the dock the late at night it’s just me, the moonlit lake lapping at the shore, the frogs singing and maybe a fog so the lake seems endless. I don’t exactly spend a lot of time in nature and outdoors but wow do I have an appreciation for the life around me. And take immense satisfaction doing when I can to minimize my and societies negative impact on it.

Anyways I could ramble on, maybe I’m wrong but watching your videos for years and years I get a sense you appreciate nature and the land around you. 
Clearly I know you enjoy computer games and tech as well, so do I and as I’ve gotten older it’s occupied more and more of my life, but I just saw that beaver dam and it struck me to ask you about something unrelated to the digital world we all engage in. 

-with love from a long time viewer and someone who started playing Minecraft around late 2009-20010 K Spivis. (That gives me cred right? Jkjk lol)

Also ps I know this “Letter” is probably too long for any of your questions of the day and I’m not even confident right now that you do those on hermitcraft videos but I thought I’d write to you regardless. Maybe you’ll see  this maybe you won’t, maybe others will see this and respond with their some do their favorite native plants and animals, but I hope you do too, if you even see this but i wouldnt blame you even if you do see this one long comment among thousands of others, obvi. Okay goodbye."

0,etho slowly typing out PEA for Permit Enforcement Agency was SUCH a good bit
0,"love the terraforming! for the rocks: theyre a little horizontally stripy, maybe incorporate a little more shading between rocks to break them up a bit more? also, the two different colors of rocks right next to each other doesn't make as much sense for sedimentary rock, but if you fade the different colors over the course of the riverbed it might work better, like where it's dryer the rock is a little redder or something. or maybe on one side of the riverbed the rock and biome in general is different and the way the sun comes down and the river splits the landscape affects the different rock formations and deposits?"

0,"I've been using a modified version of this sorter on a bedrock realm. It took a lot of tweaking for my personal use but  it's still functional.

Hopper clock just as you have that sends out carts. It runs through a water stream under a chest that gets loaded with items. Cart goes through entire system and at the end, leftover items pull from the cart and water streams back to a chest above the input water stream, but directly after the user input chest. This means i can input full stacks and let it go. There's a standard MIS at the input for things like cobble, dirt, etc. Most of the tweaking was around bulk items getting through the entire system and filling up the minecart dispenser when the cactus breaks the cart"
0,"I highly recommend you add mossy cobble to your stones, especially because it makes sense for water, animal life, etc., to cause moss growth on river rocks, but also because it helps with the color transition from the stones to the surface grass!"
0,I actually started using tnt to terraform because of you and never went back
0,Couldn't you use and activator rail to lock the hopper minecart so it cant steal any items?

0,"i think youre off to a great start with the river rocks etho! I love terraforming as a peaceful way to pass the time, but I’m ofc no expert. However, I did want to suggest maybe adding a block to unify the layers. Generally I go for stone/cobblestone. I’ll make the overall shape I want out of that base block, then go in and add shading and highlights here and there. Otherwise the ‘boulder’ ends up looking too much like different layers in the ground, instead of one cohesive structure! 

Anyway, this was a fantastic episode and I really enjoyed watching 😊 maybe talk with Scar a bit to get some more ideas? hes a landscaping expert! 

thank you for the episode!"

0,You should install a redstone clock on the beavers so they can periodically slap the water with their tails
0,33:48 you had me rolling on the floor with laughter here 😂 pea
0,"My two cents on the rocks:

Large stones that break the direct flow of water are usually homogeneous. Cobblestone (in Minecraft, the block I mean) is sediment. It looks like dense pebbles unlike stone (the block, again) which looks like a cube of solid stone.

So when making rocks that are going to block the flow of water, I would think you'd want those boulders to appear as a big, solid, stone, rather than sediment. Because you're trying to mix up the palletes in your boulders (which is good and necessary) you're mixing in some blocks that I'd categorize as ""packed sediment"", but perhaps it feels a bit off because it doesn't seem like those blocks could affect the flow of water. 

Another way to think of it is that if we had a ""block"" of cobblestone in real life and put it in a rushing river, the water would push the cobbles apart and sweep them away.

This is also why you get a lot of sediment at the bottom of rivers, but if the boulder is affecting the flow then it's still solid.

Excellent episode as always!"

1,"I think the issue with the rocks might be the block textures rather than colours. The colour gradient looks pretty good, but blocks like wool and concrete powder don't have a texture that makes you immediately think rock when you don't have the context of the other blocks, even though their colour is good."

0,"10/10 episode thank you very much! <3

Got two suggestions for the terraforming: 

1. don't be afraid to use normal stone in the rocks as well! I think the thing that you can't quite put your finger on/that makes it ""uncanny"" is that there's no regular stone in there at all, and so the minecraft brain doesn't fully register them as rocks 

(Also personally I'd ditch the wool, because it has a strange texture for a rock, but that might just be me)

2. Take a good chunk of the plateau in the ""balcony"" area towards Pearl's base and lower it by 5 or 6 blocks to create a second plateau, say, a 20x30 block area or so. Put some natural stone stairs leading down - it will help break up the terrain and enhance and frame the panorama view even more! Bonus if you can see down to the foot of her base (and perhaps even the ocean) when walking out from your front door"

0,How dare youtube not recommend me this immediately! it got recommended 17 hrs later
1,Etho. You got too many rocks. Rivers do randomly meander especially through flat land. The other option is small cliffs. Just raise the land on a spot you want to turn away from 5-10 blocks. Also you're in a mountain put stones out of the river where you want it to go down. Make rapids
0,"If you get to hide your bed, you should use the trick of covering it but leaving the corners free.

Considering the depth of the river, that dam isn't damming much. 😂

Unless there is another blockage later, maybe a big rock just before the waterfall and at each elevation change.

1,I love that hermits projects have become so big that they are allowing them to be passed to forward seasons without having to redo all the work.
1,"I love the the idea of incorporating an ecosystem to give your terraforming more life. Plus, it makes for an interesting story and world building! As a biology student, I got so exited when you were talking about the river and the sorrounding fauna. You keep introducing us to such great ideas! I look forward to what you have in store for the river in the future. Thank you for the video, Etho! Take care always 💚"

0,"ooh! this crystal would be bought, don't you worry"
0,"Etho, some river facts for you. Rivers naturally carve through terrain and there does not have to be a terrain reason for it to bend. It's the flow if the water that erodes the terrain and in doing so creates bends. A rivers bends are always changing, it's an unstable system."

0,"I made a beaver dam/lodge base years ago and I never was quite satisfied with it since I really only had logs, stripped logs, and dirt to work with.  Basically ended up with it mostly being a single huge tree the ""beavers"" felled (beavers have interesting lore on the main server I play on) with stuff filling up the gaps.  Ever since the mangrove roots, mud, and moss became a thing I have really wanted to try it again but just haven't gotten around to it."

0,You should see if Cleo would armor stand a family of beavers
0,Can Poe really exile Etho? He's quite literally being a hermit
0,I think what makes the rocks in the river look meh is that they lack some shape language. They are more of a coat of paint on top the landscape but don't have distinct shapes worked in or out of them. One trick which I have found helpful with that is simple rule that blocks of different material ie. rock and grass have to be at right angles. Materials shouldn't transition on the same plane.
0,I think the beaver was actually better with the item frame still visible; looks like a little face
0,Definitely add some reeds and lillypads to the lake
0,On the lake you should use green glass panes/ bamboo and brown candles to make cattails as well as  sugarcane and seagrass around some edges to make little nooks that fish can hide and live in.

0,"couldn't you have a way for fans to submit fanart and give you a license allowing it to be shown in a single video or something?

I mean, you would probably need to double check with a lawyer that you're not taking away their ownership of the piece, and make sure that its just allowing you to use it in a single video, but that might be a solution if you really want to show the artwork (though this would ofcourse be a lot of work)"
0,"Rocks: the side facing upriver add sticks and mangrove roots etc that ""got caught"" on the rock. Downriver side more greeny mossy cobble stuff because the water doesn't flow as much so it gets all algaeeeyy-y :P
Love the damm, can you swim inside? That'd be a cute detail"
0,"Ahh Etho, you missed the chance to extort diamonds from poe via crystal shop. Since it is a low demand high input item and the permit office wants a shop for it, you can in a way ask them to fund the shop just like the real governments fund the less profitable but needed business."
0,"9:57 In real life, rivers actually tend to bend more and more over time until they either get so curved that they collide with themselves or they hit something they can't erode as easily
You'd need justification for it being entirely straight if it was long enough and surrounded by dirt"
0,Etho who are you gonna vote in next canadian elections ?
0,"etho, you should make your end crystal shop a super high end with basically an all white room with only one thing in it and it's super rare which means it's super expensive! so that means no one will buy it so you won't need a large inventory. win win"
0,"Not only rocks change the flow 
Its mostly the debree with different mass and density that settles at different point from entering the river and it also depends on the volumentric flow (speed) of the river and also the it changes over time by the average diameter of the riverbed becouse it narrows by the settlement"
0,"About rocks: think of them shape first. Rocks are pieces of big burried stones. You have to give a feeling of this, a bit like some 90s 3D artist making a low poly rock, get that shape to work for your landscape. Then only do detailing.
Also about the gradiant: it's not progressive at all. The wet par its much darker. Even if you want to shade according to lighting at least work along this logic of faces. If you just do bottom to top gradient everything is shapeless. 

IMO your approach of ""making sense"" is excellent. If you feel stuck, always come back to it.

Your barrage and pond are great btw. Awesome beavers!"

0,"Your rocks are maybe a bit too like a stair. Try making bigger blocks, squares, or maybe steeper parts as well, to make varieity :) 
Thank you for the video and I love to watch you learn"
0,"Wait, the permit office warned for months, you didnt build shops
Deffinetely their fault?"
0,"i think the issue with the rocks is that there's just too many of them. natural rives have more shallow sections where the water wouldn't be more than one block deep, and this is where the mud shines. if a river is wide and then has a small section the water will flow quicker through that section, likely eroding rocks quicker, while the mud will pile up on the wide slow sections. vary your sections and chop the top off those rocks. it makes little sense for the ground to go up around the edges of a river when it should go down instead. unless you're going for a more man made channel type situation but considering the beavers (which looks so cute btw) i'd say widen everything and make for more of a transition of the edges. more vegetation in the slow sections (dripleaves, leaf litter, mangrove roots, lily pads) could make it look more natural but that's a later step."

0,"I think, for competitive games on Hermitcraft that span many months, it would be better if the trophies didn't go to the people that have the highest scores that season, but to the people who both have the highest scores AND beat their previous all-time highs that season if they've been a winner in the same place or higher before. This prevents trophy farming, where Joel wins the first try, i.e. he has to play better than his best. It makes winning feel like more of an achievable goal, because winning isn't necessarily directly dependent on the big numbers you see on the scoreboard. And it incentivises pacing yourself a little bit more slowly and not overplaying the game, lest you set a high score that is unbeatable by your future self."

0,the moss rocks are really pretty !
1,I'm starting hermit -craft from here hop you don't kick the bucket anytime soon❤

0,Just came to the conclusion that I’ve been watching Etho for 13 years. Feeling old now
1,"Gotta use stairs and walls to create ""cracks"" and imperfections in your rocks to make them look more natural, if that's what you're going for. The standard Minecraft block/slab look is too clean. Could even incorporate glass panes if you can get the colorization down well enough."
0,BEAVER DAM IS JENIOUS JENIOUS
0,"I think the mossy rock is the best, especially since it's next to water. I also think that the beaver dam should be just slightly taller, it's too flush with the ground, it's hard to notice what it actually is from above."

0,Stop spending so much time on rocks
0,"FYI, rivers don't need boulders to curve, you can watch the video ""why rivers curve"" frome minute earth if you want to learn about it but the TLDR is that any slight curve will make it so the water slams against the exterior of the curve and will bend it even more over time. So the slightest asperities could lead over time to bends."

7,"If you think Minecraft limitations make those beavers too big, you're wrong! That 3m-long and 1m-tall body perfectly matches the size of the giant fossil beaver that that lived 1.9 millions to only 11 thousands years ago: _Castoroides_ . Etho's beaver's are that, that's the best headcannon, and you can't convince me otherwise. 🔥

0,make a pvp arena made of obsidian so people would buy the end crystal
1,10:01 did you know that rivers naturally start to curve because the erosion of the water slowly wears down the bends that are already there due to gravity and the waters natural flow. This continues over time and just strengthens the waviness of the river! I forgot what it’s called but I thought it was cool. :3

0,"snow is melting for me, streams in the forest hills are bubblin'.       imo etho, u should have mud/sand/gravel/cobblestones as a riverbed.   the sturdier stones should be lining the stream because that's what it hasnt been able to erode yet.   and at least around me, the rocks that are at/above the waterlevel tend to be completely moss covered.   tehe for extra credit, u could even construct a wind-blown tree that fell across the streambed cuz i see that a lot 😊

With the rocks, I remember from one of bDubs' videos that he tried to use the highlighting and shadows to make each rock/boulder distinct from each other which can be found in the boulders around his ""starter"" house. I wonder if doing something similar would help it not feel like one jumbled stone, but instead separate big rocks making up the rivers edge? Just a thought"

1,"The places where the river drops, you should add some partially submerged stones to break up the drop point. Most rivers have drops like this when there is a row of rocks blocking the flow"
1,"You are on the right track for terraforming with trying to make it make sense! Like the rocks to give the river a reason to bend. Its not always necessary but its a nice marker for where you should place details around your river. What i think matters more for the trajectory of the river is the overall shape of the area. Only adding rocks to guide it is going to make it feel man-made even if the rocks are supposed to look natural. 
The thing with the rocks feeling off when you go further away is not rly an issue with the rocks but just an issue of having to tie the river in better with the rest of the area. You could lower the water level by 1 block, whittle down some of the rocks and some of the terrain between them to get some erosion gaps. Think that would both give you a nicer view of river and help tie it in with the rest of the area. Also think adding a few rocks outside the river instead of having them only around it would help tie it in with the rest.
One thing you could do to add texture to the rocks is just add moss or folliage on them. Maybe even add some folliage into the parts of river that would be calmer and that could serve as a ""seed"" for the folliage to creep up on the rocks as well. 
And one more thing that kinda bothered me a little bit with the beaver dam is that the volume of water flowing from it feels like too much to be leaking from a dam."

0,"Hello, I love terraforming in minecraft and it takes ages, but when working with water a really easy way to make it look tons better is to make everything under the water slightly darker than above. So If you've got the pale moss in an area where water is going to be going next to it, keeping the pale moss above the waterline but changing the block below to be darker makes it look awesome. I figured even if this doesn't get read by Etho, someone might appreciate the info, so here it is"

As to your rock issues, as someone who has done EXTREMELY little terraforming, one thought that I had was that something that was looking unnatural about the rocks was that it was one big boulder, not like a bunch of medium sized rocks. So maybe try playing with depth and different color palettes to make it feel like there's multiple rocks, not just a big boulder? idk, something to try perchance"
0,"The beaver made me laugh so hard, I love the design"
0,"Definitely go for the mossy rocks! River shores are very damp places, after all. You could also go for a smooth look rather than having a ton of texture, since they'd get weathered away by the water flow."

0,"While river courses CAN be diverted by large rocks, that is not the reason they meander.

The reason has to do with flow rate and dissolved sediment. When the dissolved sediment drops out and builds up enough to divert the water course it is essentially lengthening the rivers total course and therefore reducing it's effective flow. Eventually reaching an equilibrium where the rivers length and its ability to carry sediment are balanced."

0,"Recommendation for the rocks? Cover them up with grass! It'll give the appearance of a river bank, look good from the land (just grass/hill), and look good from the other side (rock).

Otherwise, I honestly think that the smooth stone looked just as good. Detail can pull the attention away from the shape and pull focus towards the texture, which I don't think is preferred here. Smooth stone gave the idea for what's going on with boulders (which I generally associate with being one kind of rock, not multiple) without being too bland (once the water is added in)."

0,"You could actually just give the Poe Poe back any permits you don’t want to use - but this is so much funnier!
For the rocks - maybe add more variation in their size and reduce the number? Another thing that makes a river bend is different densities of soil (soil that has more clay in it will erode slower than that without) you could mirror this in-game by using the different dirt types: coarse, regular, and rooted - regular should erode fastest (lightest), then coarse dirt (heavier), then rooted dirt (roots bind it together so it can resist erosion better). It may also help to pick an imaginary position for the Sun, then you can make areas facing that Sun lighter, and those facing away nice and shady - that should add depth to your rocks."
0,Hey Etho! Have you ever considered breaking up your videos with contents in the description? Sometimes I go to a video and have trouble finding a certain part of it because there aren't any sections to hover over and select from.

0,I'm stumped on why Etho ate that zombie flesh at 11:11
10,I’m only halfway through the video but a suggestion to make the beaver dam more *tastefully* chaotic would be adding smothered campfires and/or some brown candles because then there’s more depth/dimension but not to an extreme extent

0,"Hey Etho. With rocks I find less is more. Your rocks were quite busy. Which might be why they didn’t look right to you. The last two rocks that you made were good. The granite rock and the moss rock. Rocks near water usually have moss or other green colouring to them and rocks further away from the river, usually have different colours and depending on the environment and temperature is how much green they may have on them. I am from a hot tropical area and we have a lot of mossy rocks around rivers. I love the beaver idea. Looking forward to seeing how that idea turns out. Thanks for the video."

Anyway thanks for the video Etho, they're never too long, and this was awesome 👍❤ ALL of that fan art is amazing btw you guys, wow!❤

Etho- you asked for feedback on the river? I was thinking, anytime I've been in a natural forest area with like a creek or a small river, I've noticed that there are a LOT of brown or brownish rocks forming the waterway, it's not all just grey. I think granite is a little too red to work, but maybe if you could work some dripstone in there, and maybe something else more brown? Mix that in with the grey rocks, and then add some moss/mossy stone to the places where the water wouldn't be moving quite as fast, like especially above the water line so it's visible. There are also other colors of lichens and things that can grow around those areas, I think you might have to just play with it a little. But those would be my tips 😊 (Also, I like the tuff and the dripstone blocks for their textures, they both kind of insinuate movement, and I think that works for moving water/maybe the idea of light reflecting off the ripples and stuff.)

Also, best shop idea ever, well played 😂❤ They never said it's illegal to use an abandoned structure.  The holes outside from the imminent explosions will add a nice weathered feel, too!"

1,lighting is going to RNG one of those end crystals and its GOING to be funny
0,"@EthosLab 
The problem you're having with your gradient is that, as you mentioned, you don't see any of what's below the water.  Bring your darkest blocks up until they are at or just below the water surface and then do a truncated version of your gradient.  Water makes dirt dark, so lighter colors under water make no sense unless they are individual stones.
I suggest invisible armor stands holding the lighter color rocks just at or barely below water height.

Second, your ""Feature Boulders"" should be a different color from your river bed to draw the eye and keep everything from looking monotone. Even if it's just that they are a shade or two lighter or darker than the rest.

Along the same lines as that idea, you can incorporate a few ""gemstones"" in random places, especially below the surface.  The sparkles of color will do amazing things.   For this, Id trade the light color stones for Glass Blocks, Amethyst Blocks, etc...

Also, break one block on your Beaver Dam to let water pour over.  It gives the build life."
0,I think adding some buttons to the rocks would look great for some extra detail!

0,Turn the rocks into boulders. Make some of them extend 3-5 above the ground
0,"I think the main issue you're having with the boulders in the river is the layering is too uniform, and they're all kind of 'facing the same way'. Try and layer some rocks at an angle against others, these aren't necessarily sediment rocks, they could have fallen into the river and gotten lodged at different angles, and different heights. You have all the same blocks in all the same layers no matter the rock, which Is contributing to them looking very blob like and non-distinct. I would also try to add some highlights on edges of different rocks against each other, not necessarily the brightest block in your pallet, but at least a couple shades up."

1,"Wait wait wait waaaiiittt… Season 10 episode THIRTEEN?

LOL Talk about a slow burn."
0,"I prefer the cartoon type villains, Cleo was exceptional this week! 😊💐"
0,"Fun fact about rivers: Even if you had a perfectly straight river, minuscule deviations in its flow will cause portions of one bank to be eroded more than the other, which will in turn direct more water against that bank, which will erode it more, eventually forming a curve. The interior of this curve, having slower-moving water, will deposit sediments, further shaping the flow of the river. The curve will direct the water against the opposite bank further along the river, doing the same to it.
Eventually, this cycle of erosion and deposition results in rivers so curved they look like a bunch of S's in series. When the curves grow so wide that they meet each other, the water of course takes the path of least resistance, and stretches of the river dry up - but the deepest portions of the curve remain as lakes, and due to their curve they're known as bow lakes.
So if you want to terraform a river, figure out where you want it to start, then where you want it to end, and mark out the likeliest route - then as you're digging it out, pay special attention to making sure its curves are wide and sweeping, and try to match each bend with an equal and opposite one further down the line."

I feel like if you brought the (light concrete) edges back into the grass and added mossy cobble. It could make it more appealing... bushes as well... 
Also, consider light posts as if it's a park or fishing spot. I think it would tie your base back in. Since you have a lot of grey in the river. Adding some colors, like benches and lived in areas, will add a nice contrast to the grey scale."

0,"Rivers don't really curve for a reason. They are chaotic, ever-evolving systems. The slightest turn will cause water to erode one side more heavily than the other, which causes the turn to grow, which causes further erosions. Eventually, the curve grows so big that the river hits itself, making a shortcut for the water and slowly drying out a large section. The cycle then repeats."
1,"The rocks look good! But I think the issue might be the graininess of the block textures, it makes the rocks look like they would weather away from the water easier than your idea suggests; of them being tough enough to resist the water. The granite ans mossy rocks look way stronger."

Overall, I think you should focus on having a nice ""background"" shade that's meant to look like one main formation, maybe mostly smooth stone/andesite shades, and then mix in granite and diorite features, to mimic the way rocks form naturally in the real world. Cleo could probably lend you some of her geology knowledge in that department :)
Also, you should try tripwire hooks for the beaver's feet!"
4,21:09 you could add camp fires to the dam

0,"My feedback on the rocks - I think that the concept of ""These asre boulders diverting the river"" is getting lost and it just feels like ""There is a gray edge to the river"".

Adding seapickles or other glowing items under the water can help to let people SEE all the cool details your adding as well!"
0,i think some gold ore would look great in your river

0,"I think with the river the problem is you're using rocks to build a bank, rather than the river and the rocks carving each other. That dip under the rock int he river is a good feature but I think it would do better if you made the rocks ont he far side a bit more cliff-like and possibly instead of looking like piles like a large boulder sitting atop it. Also the darker parts should peak out out fo the water where the river is hitting the rock, at it is constantly being sprayed, and more moss would grow in those areas. a bit less rock and a bit more dirt above the water might also help, and of course foliage will just make things look better in general. Foliage is gonna want to grow next to the water so theres gonna be topsoil and little scraggly bushes growing from the rocks. especially with how deep the river is, it can be expected that its been there a long time, but with the beaver dam feature consider the while area would be flooded before that, so maybe bring the bank back a bit where the soil is and have the rocks shape be more affected by the rushing water. part of it is that the rock features end at the riverbank despite sticking up so high."

0,"For the river, I would put a defining line where the water is, so that it's dark *under* the water and light *over* it. Right now it looks like you just made a gradient and then chucked some water in wherever. (cause you did ...)

For your end crystal shop, you could just craft one and set the price to 1,000,000 diamond blocks. Technically fulfills the contract and you won't have to make more. (EDIT or you could do some absolutely diabolical Etho-level trolling, well done)"
0,It was amazing to catch up. We'll see you back in 3 months
0,You could possibly detail some of the river with root wads using mangrove roots and maybe some stone buttons in and around the water
0,"Fun fact: Rivers actually snake naturally, even without any notable obstacles. The reason in general is that the erosion tends to make even small bends even larger. This happens motly on rivers with small slopes though."
0,"Hey Etho, you mentioned that you enjoy logical reasons when designing your builds. While logic is a great focus, it can sometimes mask some other aspects which would make the build a lot more natural looking. For example, water may divert because it hits a dense rock. But it also diverts because it hits a softer area of soil, or reaches a slope. So if the rocks are getting too frustrating, maybe instead make that portion of the river use some ""softer"" materials, like clay and mud, all the way up to the grass, and then have maybe some course dirt as a buffer between the rock and that softer patch?

Either way, I love the video and hope that the landscaping doesn't wear you out too much."

0,"Etho, when trying to replicate rivers that are rocky like this, it’s important to have rocks in the river that break up the flow of the water. Often times the rocks are subsurface and the water flows over top of them which might be hard to reproduce in Minecraft but is something to consider. Rocks that jut out over the river are also very common.

A suggestion for making the rocks look good is to make sure to clearly outline each individual rock. If the shading is uniform across every rock it’ll look like there are no individual rocks which is not true to real life and just generally doesn’t look as good. And of course vary the sizes of the rocks to make it look a bit more natural. In terms of moss vs no moss, typically if the river is in enclosed in the woods there will be moss on the rocks, but if the river is out in the open there usually won’t be."

0,"Important terraforming trick for rocks: Add slabs, stairs, and other non cubic blocks, and add foliage! Also, think about how the natural erosion would shape it, and add textural elements based off of that. Also I feel like the shading is way overhyped, it always looks unnatural to me and only makes sense on a very large scale. In real life rocks are not naturally shaded like that. There might be textural and colour differences but definitely not a consistent dark to light bottom to top gradient like that. Foliage helps to hide a lot of sharp changes and jank, and helps make things look more natural. It also helps to blend in with the surrounding lush nature. Hope this helps! Landscaping is like the one bit of Minecraft I'm _actually_ good at lol, so its nice to be able to chip in for once."

0,"this was absolutely jam-packed omg!!!! a proper feast, thank you etho!! 

honestly I really liked your terraforming of the river, and that beaver dam is /amazing/. I think my one thought from my own terraforming work, is to not be afraid to let some areas be just one type of block. I noticed you sort of did layers of each block up the side of the river's edge - which also, yknow, happens irl as sediments do their thing - but I think your build style intentionally meshes really well with the scale minecraft operates at (compared to other hermits who may build bigger (ex. bdubs + scars trees, the cities vs. the armor stand mod tricks.)) so matching how minecraft lumps blocks together may help you out as you build up your skills to the more detailed terraforming other hermits do

love seeing you branch out, excited for all the exile shenanigans"

About your river struggle:
I'd try to just hide the rock's backside when you can't figure it out to make them look good. Juat put some shrubs, some leaves and such on the side away from the river.
For the beavers: How about trip wire hooks for feet? Or item frames with... Wodden shovels maybe?
For the dam: a few dead shrubs (the atuff you find in MC deserts) would look great on it. Loving the idea!

I love the beaver dam!"
0,"Loved the video, Etho! Starting the episode by going into your base and checking out the mail makes the world feel more real and alive. I think it would be good to add different points of interest further into your house so we get to see you walk through and interact with your house more often in the episodes.
The river is looking great. No idea how to help you with the river rocks other than adding slabs and buttons. I also think you might be going a little wild with your palette, just some basic cobble and smooth stone is probably enough but always interesting to see you find your own unique solutions.
Framing the view as you leave your house with trees seems like a great idea in my mind and I'd love to see how it turns out.
Kinda crazy that building that entire ghast farm was just 2 minutes of an episode. I do love seeing a bunch of different projects in an episode but I also like more ""Hey let's try building this thing together"". We almost don't get to see you place any blocks anymore with the ultra polished video style you're moving towards.
Looking forward to the next episode! <3"

0,"Ohh Etho, you are so cheeky with that bit at the end xD
I love the beaver dam and the beaver is perfect, really cute and sells it despite it being such a small scale! For the rocks I do think the mossy boulder looks better than the granite, maybe because there's not a lot of other red rock in the area so it stands out a bit much, I think.
Hope you're doing well! Thanks for the video :D"

0,Hi @etho. I think the rocks work in the context of the game for why the river bends great. It also helps with the visual appeal which is the most important part. I just wanted to nerd out a little and mention that rivers will naturally bend without the need of rocks. A river that starts straight with a slight perturbation will naturally become curved overtimes. This is because a small bend will cause water to impart a force on the edge as its velocity is changed. Overtime this will erode the edge more and it will become even more exagerated. This will lead to other edges having a slight bend which will also become exagerated. So its really just time + physics = curved rivers. For more info the wikipedia page on meandering rives can explain this in more details.

0,"Hey Etho! Love your river and how it is panning out. But you said one thing that got my geology brain a thinkin'. Andersite, Diorite, and Granite are all Mafic Volcanic rock that are denser and more resistant to erosion. I suggest that at some of the river bends, you put these types of blocks into the bend and mix it with some smoothed versions to show long-time water erosion. Which is what happens to river rocks over time. They get smooth."
0,"Beaver dam,... Maybe break a block so the water spills over? Looks a little too contained as it is."

12,"Any mention of rivers curving just puts me right back to year 5 geography, studying oxbow lakes (the curves get curvier and curvier until they curve into eachother and become straight again). I love the beavers SO MUCH! Beavers have just been reintroduced to the UK, after being extinct here for 400 years, which is pretty dam (haha) cool :)
It's also really nice to know you save fanart... as someone whos made fanart I always think its one of those things that must be a little bit weird to be on the receiving end of (or at least it would be for me). It makes me happy to know that you are both aware and appreciative of it :D"

Add trees growing on the sides or on top of the rocks can add more greenery 
Make the waterfall drop more steep and a single water block height because waterfalls usually came from the river's surface falling off a cliff (big waterfall)
Oh and add invisible armor stands holding a stair block for the beavers feet"
0,i love you 🥺
0,LOVE the beaver dam!! going to be putting one in my area on my server :]

1,"Great video! Lots of great moments all around, I especially love the little beaver you made and the contrast of beavers living in a jungle! You did a great job with making the river look natural, and the lake being at the base of a mountain makes a lot of sense for why there would be so much water pooling there.

1,"personally, id take orange teeth of they were as strong as iron, but maybe im weird 😅😅"
0,"Your rocks on your river may be to ""chunky"", too fat and too close together. It could work on some terrains, but your base main area is quite flat, so your river should somewhat reflect that instead of clashing with it. Try to make some wide rocks on the side that merge on your ground instead of a big line of balls as a border between the 2 features."
0,"Love the river, the beaver dam and the beaver!❤ As mentiones by others rivers dont need a reason to meander, they just do. Riversides are often very wet, so lots of moss, ferns and foliage. Thats why the red boulder feels off(too clean). The area around rivers can be very heterogenous/patchy because the river makes some parts wetter than others (swampy). Suggestion: every good lake needs a little cattail/reed patch"

P.S. Googled beaver teeth - they really are BRIGHT ORANGE oh my goodness!"
0,"maybe make the river vary in thickness for a bit more natural appearance?
and the mossy rocks look real nice in the green jungle, they make sense to be overgrown in a place so green. I also like the granit rocks cus orange and green are good color combination"
0,"Sir etho it’s about the color of the rocks, the color sort of flows like…sediment? What I mean is it’s meant to take the adherence of darker rock sort of slowly layering into lighter rocks. Kinda like how it would happen in rivers or lakes in real life. Also bring the deep slate deeper into the mud. I think that would help give you more room to work"

48,"absolutely love the beaver dam. fun fact, in real life beavers are considered a keystone species, which is a species that is particularly important in maintaining their ecosystem. in simple terms, beavers make a dam, the dam makes a pond, and other species come live in that pond! when you mentioned how the dam could inspire more details like the birds nest or the fallen trees it reminded me of that. art (or minecraft build) imitates life! :D"
0,For the end crystals: Just secretly sell them in the obsidian shop. Shade-E-E style.
0,"on the dam, have you seen B'Dubs' waterfall?"
0,"i think for rocks, i agree with more ""sectioned"" as opposed to true ""random"" but you need to mix in randomness, for example a ""darker"" section is 80% deepslate and 20% tuff, then for a mediym section its 50% tuff, 25%deepslate, 25%light grey wool, and then light section is 25/75 light grey wool and tuff just for ecample. so view the regions as ""more green/red/stone"" as opposed to more granite more moss etc"

Doing too much before you even fill is stupid."
0,"You might have already thought of this but for the sorting system if you space the chests further apart the hopper minecarts wont be right beneath the hoppers. While this increases the space, it avoids the issue you mentioned letting you run the minecarts at 5s instead of 15! As always love your videos <3"
7,"personally i think the pink rock looks better because it matches the mud pathways and the cherry leaves in the back, but both are very well balanced and look great"
0,"Rocks around river IMO are weathered above the water(adding the noise and texture with tuff on top instead of middle) and the close to river is usually washed and does not have much texture. To me the shapes are fine, but it feels like the top of rocks are not textured enough. Maybe switching the wool with the tuff/pale moss could change the feel of it. Of course it is a personal preference so build as you feel. Thank you for another fun video <3"
0,"For your first attempt at terraforming, this is really good! I believe a big problem that's making the river feel odd is that there isn't much of a transition from the landscape to the river. Also the river is mostly consistently wide and I believe variations in how wide the river is would work wonders. I would also consider variations in the sizes of boulders (possibly use the golden ratio to determine the size variations). I love how you did some of the boulders with granite. To help with the shading, I would research pixel art shading (hue shifting, limited palette + dithering, pillow shading vs. proper shading). In order to maintain vibrant colors while shading, you can adjust the hue and saturation instead of just adjusting the value. Brighter moves closer to yellow and darker moves closer to purple. Something that may help would be opening up the Minecraft textures in photoshop and doing an average blur on the textures. While you construct the boulders, use the resource pack and then turn it off when you're done."

14,"Just as a note Etho, rivers will meander even through uniform soil. The smallest perturbations to the flow of the water will over time become more pronounced, unless the river is unnaturally straight and the flow of the water if perfectly laminar, which is not possible under natural conditions, then imperfections will accumulate and cause the water to exert uneven pressure on different sides, leading to different levels of erosion, and eventual bending. The factors at play in the winding of rivers is extremely complex, there are entire careers based on learning and understanding only parts of it. Hitting a harder layer of rock or soil isn't required for a river to divert, it's not possible outside of man-made materials and maintenance for a river to flow perfectly straight, at least not for an extended period of time.

For the bever dam, it doesn't look like any water is flowing through it, the bever dams don't fully block water flowing, only partially. To make it looks like water is leaking through the dam slowly, the roots you have there can be waterlogged, at least the ones near the bottom."

Your Beaver dam blew me away on its own but then when you added the little Beaver 😢 oh my goodness. On the subject of keeping the area scened appropriately, make sure you leave some birch trees around (custom or not). Beavers love birch! Though you seem knowledgeable about them so you probably already knew that. 😊

Side note--- Mumbo made a fortune on his end crystals in season 8. You can too!"
0,Aww a beaver dam is a lovely idea :3
0,"About the rocks: I think less would more. While I like your texturing it feels a bit odd that only at the river there are (so many) rocks. Maybe try to reduce the number of river rocks (by half?) and add one or two stray around your house?
About the reddish rock: Maybe indicate only one or two red veins in the other rocks instead making one big red rock?"
0,"The reason rivers in nature become curvy is because they flow from an incline into flatter regions.  Without the incline, the water slows down and drops sediment carried within it.  That sediment then blocks it's own flow, leading it to divert to the side.  Over time you have rivers move in a snaking motion because of that.  So a winding section would usually sit on a flat region following an incline with rushing currents."
0,Where I live is covered in beaver swamps. From the thumbnail alone I knew exactly what you were doing. Beaver dams are always downstream from a beaver swamp. Would would consider a flooded forest in your landscape? Mostly dead trees with one or two flood-tolerant willows or something?

1,"Beaver facts!
Beavers use a substance called “castoreum” mixed with urine to mark their territory. Castoreum is stored in castor sacs near the anal glands. Castoreum is used in ice cream as a vanilla substitute, under the guise of “natural flavoring.” There is a common misconception that castoreum got its name from the myth that beavers would castrate themselves to spare their lives from hunters looking for castoreum, although castor sacs are completely different than *ahem* other things down there. The “castor” part of castoreum comes from the Latin word for beaver, castor. Both male and female beavers have castor sacs. Male beavers are incredibly territorial, and hunters used this to their advantage by spreading another males castoreum-urine mix in his territory. The beaver would run up and mark the territory for himself, giving the hunters easy pickings. Your welcome."

I think the mossy rock and the granite rock turned out really nice! With the gray rocks, you might be happier if you used the darker blocks like tuff for the parts above the water; your shading lost some context with the flooding and using the more ""stoney"" blocks might help add the context back"

0,You're my number one still.
0,"I know a thing or two about hydrology, and the reason rivers and streams turn is actually simpler than that. Water wants to go downhill. Even if it's just a grain of sand in the way of a trickle of water, nothing in nature is ever going to be perfectly flat; there's always going to be  slight dip that make one spot lower than the next. and if it's flowing towards a little lower spot, the water is going to erode more of that spot, making it larger difference. So now you got a slight bend in the stream, and because if how water moves it's always going to erode the outside of the bend and deposit stuff on the inside of the turn as it loses speed. Which makes the bend more extreme and exaggerates it. So over time you end up with a river that's literally snaking it's way across the landscape by weaving back and forth.

And I'm sure nobody with care about any of that, but I find it interesting."
0,"So in the past when I had a lot of energy and free time. I'd say I was a good builder and terraformer. But after not ""training"" enough anymore my skills still improved, but the community and technics improved so exponentially that I'd say I'm just oke...

So I got better but I'd rank myself lower than I was before lol. The game and people became so good at it"
0,"imo, two block beavers are too big. and spruce blends in with the dam a little too well so it kinda just looks like more dam.

you could give em eyes if you put a blackstone button on either side of the head, though they might look pretty derpy."
1,I give those end crystals 3 days MAX 😂
10,"The best advice I've ever heard for trying to replicate something from the real world, ie rocks, is to look at reference.
Cuz when we think ""rock"" it's easy to imagine a gray, roundish rock, but then you look at actual boulders that line rivers, they're varied and colorful. You might even find a rock or a picture of one that you like enough to try and replicate it exactly.
Always reference, reference, reference ❤"
2,You taking over scars building really makes me think someone needs to build a shopping mall and let people rent spaces for there lesser valued permits.
0,"The channel ""practical engineering"" has a good video as to why rivers are curvy, but the short version is that if a river is straight, it makes itself not straight."
0,"So if you had the darker red rocks by the water line then lighter towards the top, maybe even sandstone-ish, it would look like the tops are sunbleached. Also, if you pick your south side of the rock you can shade the rocks on more of an angle and its easier to tell where to shade when the rocks overlap. Like the north side of the boulders would be darker and mossier"
0,End Crystal shop is very Shade E-E
0,Thank you ETHO!
1,"Hey! On the topic of why rivers turn, they actually do make turns without reason. It's called meandering, a process where friction is higher on the outside of a stream, where it thus erodes more ground. This creates bigger and bigger turns until the river cuts through a weak spot."
0,Rivers also just refuse to flow in a straight line in nature. They're constantly eroding and depositing sediment that eventually causes the river to form snakey patterns.

0,"as an artist, i'm definitely in favour of youtubers showing fanart in their videos; i really appreciate how much support and appreciation doc gives to the fanartists in his community, for example. i understand the copyright concerns, but fanart is often a grey area in that sense anyway, since fanartist also don't own the intellectual rights to the things they're making art about. ultimately fanart is created as an expression of love and appreciation, and shouldn't be about monetary gain – the best thing that can come out of fanart for an artist is building a community with people who enjoy the same thing, and having the artwork shared is a big part of that

maybe there's a way for people to indicate that they'd like their art to be shown in a video by sharing it in a specific place or with a specific caption or hashtag or something? (as long as it's not twitter, because, well, yikes)

unrelatedly, i love the beaver dam and the chunky little beaver :D as for the rocks, i like the mossy one you made, and i think you could add some interest and impurities like you said to the grey rocks by just mixing in the occasional reddish block; i think the full red rock may stand out a little too much from what is a very natural landscape"

0,"Etho, not too long ago I started watching Naruto despite having little to no interest in anime and actually got kind of addicted
And I completely blame you
If your skin didnt happen to be Kakashi and I didnt happen to get curious this never wouldve happened, but now I am a person who watches anime. This may be a blame comment but it is also a thank you comment, thank you for getting me into a new obsession :)"

0,Love the beavers! Cheeky end crystals shop!
0,"Another river rock comment:
I would be wary of having too many rocks in your river. It looks unnatural for there to be a perfect channel bordered by rocks on both sides. You might swap out some of the rocks (especially near the house) for a ""man-made"" retaining wall, something that a human would have built to stop floods during heavy rains, or to prevent the river from meandering under the house and destroying the foundation.

As others mentioned, curves in rivers can happen without any obvious obstruction. They're also extremely liveley, and the river's path can change dramatically over seasons within its floodplain. Consider some wetland areas bordering the river (on the far side of the house? Maybe import some frogs??) to sell the ""natural"" part of the river. The river's edges are probably heavily vegetated and muddy, rather than rocky. You can find more structured ways to direct the river flow closer to the house.  

I really love the idea of this terraforming project & the fact that you're paying attention to hyrdo-logical features of the world!"
0,End Crystals can be lucrative if you A: make good farms for them and B: get people back into end-crystalling each other like they did seasooooooon 8 I think. If the popo tries to get mad about the end crystal shop you can pay a percentage of profits as a rental payment and if it doesnt work out you dont have to pay a cent!

0,"i recommend doing some research on meandering rivers and the way they’re formed and shaped! that might help with some inspiration for the shapes and gradients of the rocks. 
geology is something that would make sense to u, it has a very linear way of thinking similar to programming, music, and algebra.

0,Uno rivers card!
0,this shop seems… kind of dangerous… I LOVE IT!
1,"In nature rocky rivers are usually shallow because they usually leads into a bigger falls so the water does not have much depth, so I think it would look good if you could lower the depth and maybe add some smaller rocks in the river and let the river flow instead of it being in the same level. maybe add visible rocks at levels where the water drops and make the water move around the rocks but that being said flowing water doesn't really loos too good in Minecraft so it's a loose loose situation either way.

Some rocks surrounding the river at the river level instead of being above it would look good too I think, and since you live in a jungle the surface rocks would be covered in moss which is why the mossy stone you did at the end looks good... 

Can't wait to see how this river looks finished in the future.."
0,I don’t think people would take the orange beaver teeth unfortunately 😂 would certainly make for some cool yt videos tho
0,"That beaver gave me so much joy. It's so good :D
I think further adding details to the area like the fallen trees and so forth sounds great"
0,AT LAST
0,Etho and Tango in the same day?!
0,With the rocks maybe adding some darker patches on the areas where the water touches them could make it look a bit more realistic? Basically wet part of the rock is darker and dry part lighter
0,"Actually, in real life, rivers curve naturally! If there’s nothing to stop them, they keep curving more and more until they create some sort of “island” within the river."
0,"I prefer the ideas, beginning of the projects. I dont need you to finish projects."
5,"Hey, Etho! I think, especially under the water, using slabs and stairs as part of the rocks adds a LOT. That extra depth and texture really makes them feel real. 

The terrain is looking really good! Keep up the good work (and fishing :P)"
0,"etho, rivers meander naturally! u dont need boulders to explain y they turn 😁"
0,"you could ask pearl for rock advice!

also the end crystal shop had me cracking up 😂"
1,"You base is looking lovely Etho! Skizz was supposed to do the interior of the POE building. All he did was a floor, covered the interior walls and made a meeting table. 😂"
0,Yay! E-tho is my favorite tho
3140,"If you replace the bottom two blocks of trees with connecting opposing pointed dripstone, it'll look like trees that have been chewed down by the beavers"
0,"For the rocks, I think you are making them too spherical where rocks in real life are typically more irregulars with sharp sides and smooth sides."
0,"Terraforming tip: scatter mossy cobblestone and  mud along the waterline side of the river.  IMO, Lower the water lvl by 1 block."
0,19:15 month of what🤨 it’s march😭
118,"Etho listens. 

In the last episodes comments I saw comments that he should show more of  the process not only the result and we got detailed terraforming segment. There was also the question about the stotage systems."
0,Maybe a bit more of just plain stone towards the top of the rocks?
1,"For the beavers, you might want to look into armor stands if you want to add limbs.

Maybe some posed invisible armor stands holding blackstone stairs or slabs to act as little feet.

Or for a more vanilla method, regular armor stands that are put underground a little. Either the armor stand itself for oak plank colored feet, or wearing leather armor (the shoulder of a tunic or a hat might look good)."
0,"Fantastic work on the end crystal shop, looks amazing!"
3,"Etho is such a sneaky troll with that end crystal shop.
I love it! 😁"
0,"Suggestions i thought of for the terraforming:

1,"""its not easy being a villan character"" (For Canadian's)"
0,omg etho video i cant believe my eyes
0,"I do appreciate your bringing your knowledge about nature and wildlife into your building and work, Etho. I think infusing passion and knowledge into youtube videos / minecraft isn't that easy to do, but you make it look very simple — Hermitcraft members being amongst others who do it well. I know you once joked you couldn't be a teacher, but you do have a way to explain things! I think you've been slowly working on it all your youtube ~career, and it definitely shows. Yeah. Always love hearing about beavers, flowers, colours in nature, minecraft mechanics, ways redstone works, building theory, etc. Thank you for all you do!"
0,I bet those crystals have already blown up between Etho recording that clip and uploading this video.
0,"On rivers the outside bank on a curve is usually kinda like a cliff as the water there is moving faster and eroding faster. I like adding those in when I do rivers in game. If you drop the rock you're looking at at 15:48 and lower the bank on that side to where you'll put the water level, I bet you'll enjoy the look more"
0,"The whole time you were showing off the rocks when you first put them down I was saying you should add mossy cobble and stuff cause that would look good and make some sense so I def gotta vote for the mossy boulders, i do think you should try and get a light variety of rocks though so maybe leave the granite one as well and try and add one or two more like it, maybe even throw in a diorite one, or a few patches of diorite if you can get em to fit and make some bird dropping rocks for variety and a little bit of humor"

2,"So happy to see you practicing terraforming. I was so wowed by the beaver dam I had to say out loud ""Oh my goodness it looks so good!"" Super excited for the beavers and the beaver lodge. The Etho art is fantastic, thank you artists!"
0,"perfect timing. i'm almost caught up with your hermitcraft episodes, finally got to them in the last few days after putting it off for a year. currently part way through the one before this :))"
0,rivers also have their own way to wiggle back and forth because of silt. I builds up one side while flushing out the other side and does a trun that way. it is called meander
3,"I hope he's part of the exile storyline, so excited!"
0,"15:57 the rocks kinda look like a blanket on land instead of a rock in the land (haven’t watched far enough yet so sorry) maybe try imagining a rock in land rather than a rock on land, my theory is take a little bit of dirt away behind it that might help"
13,"I think your rocks are too round, yes Etho, rocks can be too round! Veiny formations usually look more realistic and less messy. It's fine to have a few larger vertical or horizontal formations.

I find it similar to detailing, where you don't randomly add one block once in a while, but instead have veins of a certain block. I learned this from our small friend Bdubs!

Hope you are doing well, thanks for the video"
25,Poor False lost out on some Big Business with Etho doing his own river. <3 Love Etho branching out into landscaping though.
0,I think there are too many different textures in the rocks. like the colors are gradual but the textures are randomly switching too much. I think maybe having like 3 block types with similar textures would be better
1,"Ah he’s building rocks, the month wait is understandable"
0,i would be so happy just to watch this guy make rocks. for. forever.

0,🎉
0,Etho video!! :0
0,oh my goodness
0,"thanks ergo, I needed a break <3 of course we had a bit of breach breach breach"
0,"Hi Etho, FYI rivers run fast in the middle and slow at the edges, the mud deposits where the water runs slowly. 

On the rocks, the current would be high near any rocks, to make it look good you probably want “exposed” rock face above the mud, not a gradient."
0,froglight is a transparent block
0,"I almost did the youtube commenter thing where Etho said ""I have no experience with rocks!"" and what's my first instinct? Hop into the comments and go ""Oh you should mix different gray textures and do color matching"" and thank heck I held myself back a bit cause Etho immediately started trying that."
0,"i dont like all the texturing/shading up close like that, I'd just stick to hhuge chunks of stone with andesite cleavages and/or huge boulders of granite or andesite or purple terracotta or brown terracotta

also rivers do not need giant boulders they just turn naturally based off of sediment buildup, look up horseshoe / oxbow lakes but also just like i live in florida we do not have rocks but we have tons of fresh water"
0,Etho you should play Vintage Story its basically terrafirmacraft but its own game

0,"38:00  the comedic timing, love it"
0,"I think the shading on the rocks is too smooth. I think they should have greater contrast to the riverbed. I also think mixing in areas where grass meets water or at least dirt would be better. If the entire thing is lined in some form of stone, it's too clean."

No matter where I am or where I've been, seeing an Etho upload always makes me feel safe, like I've come back home. My father recently passed away over Christmas and the last video you released came out at one of the lowest points in my life, cheering me up in ways I didn't know I needed. Forever grateful that you haven't stopped doing the incredible work that you do. Sending much love your way, God bless"

0,Oh how lovely to see the etho post notification
0,Ethooooooooo
0,The legend has returned 🙏
0,"Adding some natural hot springs, or just some steam source in places would totally fit the vibe in my opinion"
1,"10:30 the reasons rivers bend in real life is partially to do with the terrain, but also partially due to the amount of water flowing. If you have a really fast moving river it's going to erode away at the bank and push out the course of the river, and conversely if you have a slow moving river it's going to deposit a lot of the sediment it's carrying and create new terrain. So the path rivers take will tend to get longer or shorter depending on how fast the river is moving, which is related to how quickly it's going downhill and how much water it carries.

(None of this is me saying your intuition is incorrect or you should do stuff differently btw! Just commenting that there's a lot of nuance to this you might not expect! I highly recommend checking out Practical Engineering if you interested in how stuff like this works, he's got great physical demonstrations too.)"
0,yo

1,"For the river, you should let the water flow at an angle (i Mean when it goes a Block down) then it look more natural and you can also let it fit in with the bit about the rocks and how the water flows."

34,the beaver dam and beavers!! such a good and unique feature
18,That prank is the funniest moment in hermitcraft history
0,"for some river rock inspiration go check out Scar's place, might be discouraging might be inspiring lol"
0,I love the beaver so cute!
8,"The rocks look good! The thing that makes them stand out is the contrast with the grass. Adding moss and mossy cobble will help blend, but as you decorate the landscape more the contrast be toned down. E.g. the beaver dam adds so much to the build. As you add trees, you can add roots and dirt which will help.

Edit: this will teach me to watch the whole video before commenting. The moss looks good, the granite rock too - could be a pop of colour in one area of the build!"
3,"In my experience plant life in water helps the most. Sea pickles, drip leaf, kelp, and green glass panes go a long way."
0,The beavers! So cute
0,Ethooooo
1,of course the canadian man would make a beaver habitat
20,"Rivers can just meander and curve due to erosion, and if they curve too much and touch a previous section, it'll straighten out where it contacted itself due to the quicker path, leaving something called an oxbow lake. It is really interesting! To go with this, rivers actually wont get bendier if there is something blocking them from eroding into a larger curve.

Edit: Also, Jake Kelton Crafts did something interesting, he used the Bdubs glass method for waterfalls mixed with redstone and piston feed tapes to animate a waterfall. Really cool idea! He also made an animated fan inspired by Mumbo's fan, which inspired Mumbo to make an animated fan funnily enough."
0,of course the canadian man would make a beaver habitat
2,Love the river and lake so far. I think once you get some plants and foliage in it'll make those tops of the rocks standout a lot less. Looks awesome so far though!

0,About time 😅
31,"River boulders: another way to think about rivers turning is there's less rock in another direction, so it's easier for the water to flow that way. This is to say you don't have to have a boulder in every corner, especially if there's no hill behind it."
0,Imo I think the river would look better if you would lower the water just one block!
0,YAY! He's returned from his Fishing trip~
838,"A tidbit of river trivia for you, Etho: in the real world, rivers become more curvy as time goes on because there is more erosion where the direction changes. This makes the curved sections even more curvy and the cycle of erosion reinforces itself."
0,grabbing my snacks!!!
467,"River's don't neccecarily need an obvious reason for making random turns, they just do that. Erosion causes the meanders in rivers to grow larger and more exaggerated, even if it started from a tiny variation."
90,"Etho rivers don't run straight most of the time. Any slight inconsistency on one side of the river - and I mean slight can cause it to bend, then the force of the water hitting that bend causes it to erode over time and thus get be died and bendier until they eventually loop back over themselves. It's pretty rare to see a river completely straight."

0,Lmao I swear every time I come back after a hiatus Etho is making the biggest farm ever saying something like “I want to stop starting new projects before I finish my current ones.” Glad to see some things never change
0,"That trail chamber set up is madness. Etho, man, what can I say? No wonder you were fishing. congrats on the achievement. I didn't know it was happening and missed it. You know you're getting old when you enter fishing comps"
0,Fuggin Etho playing competitive AND casual both at the same time.
0,Dude I finally found you after years 😭 you've earned a new sub :3
0,I would not wish linking all those portals together on an enemy dang
0,"according to the minecraft wiki:    Looting has no effect in certain cases:

    Kills by tamed wolves are not affected by this enchantment, even if the target is struck first."
0,"I've always wondered how Etho managed to love Minecraft so much and after finally catching up to the video, I'm slowly understanding and incorporating Etho's point of view and I got to say, I now know why I always feel bored when playing Minecraft! Thank you!"
0,"9:45 when did they add a ""Saving World"" message?"
0,Wow huge silo spoilers woopwooop
0,"Two curious updates that will make intersting builds.

Grass now grows even away from players.  The Etho matic pop up wool farm can now be fully automated, even the crafting of shears from a chest full of iron.

There's also a silverfish powered cannon that will go well with the boat/rail system in the nether."
0,Journey before Destination. These words are accepted.
0,This was my first episode watching you  (seen Life series and a bit of hermitcraft). And I'm on my third comment. That's a good sign!
0,"Should be able to adjust the pale moss carpet to have no upward growth as well.
I like the wall climbing growth, don't come at me. I WILL defend myself (lol I won't. I won't even see your message x), but I think you should have a choice in whether your walls are clean or not, no matter what you have on your floor."
0,"Echo shards from bats is a good idea. But Mojang stopped providing us profits from animal abuse. That's what we get for enjoying games made by hippies. #savedb
Feeding bats glow berries maybe? Having them have babies that drop shards like scute.
I want bats perching like a tie, sending it to place a block mid air. 👉~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~🦇↩◾"
0,"etho, looking out over a beautiful pale forest: ""a factory would be perfect here"""
4,32:24  CHICKEN JOCKEY
0,"I still think there should something in the game you find to enchant your chest plate to have more inventory space. You start off default, but by upgrading your gear, you upgrade your inventory."
0,"28:54
You have to do something with that spire on the right! That's so cool! That's perfect for an evil mad scientist's lair!"
0,Oh silo is an amazing show
0,Decorating the trial chambers sounds cool! It'll never get done 🤣
0,"Good to hear that, even 10 years later, Ergo is still talking about ""polishing up old projects"" in his world :p"
0,"Hey Ergo, loved the video. I just am curious, how did you get the camels to walk around sandy city? What an awesome feature"
0,"I just wanna say I love you etho I’ve been watching your stuff since I was a kid obviously less so nowadays seeing as I’m 24 but I hope you continue making videos for many years to come so when the day comes that I have kids they may get to enjoy the beautiful builds you make and the mind bending red stone contraption you construct.
I think the last video I really remember watching was you making your tamagotchi Wilson lol but I know I was watching for years before that episode too lol. I think I’ve been a fan of you for more than half my life now love you dude. Lol"
0,"He Etho, I was just watching the podcast episode you did with Skizz and Impulse, and you mentioned that your favorite genre of game is the roguelike! Would you ever consider doing YouTube content on games in this genre like slay the spire/balatro or do you plan on sticking to just Minecraft?"
0,"Hi Etho! This might seem out of pocket, but have you read the stormlight archive? All your journey vs destination talk has me wondering…
Anyway, if you haven’t, highly recommend :)"
0,"I want thirst bar and salty water. Etho, do you agree? :)"
1,"Hi, Etho, I love your videos! Congrats on the fishing win! This might be a weird question, but it's something I've been wondering since you seem to enjoy science and how things work: what do you think of quantum physics?"
0,Etho thank you for all the good memories you have made for us all this years.having the same world for over 10 years it's crazy and when I realized that you keep playing on it I got emotional man ty
0,"I found a temporary solution to the enderpearl network. A guy called Squibbles made a wireless redstone sensor that detects where the player is looking FROM ANYWHERE, and you can teleport by looking in the right direction. It will probably be patched at some point"
0,Holy crap I used to watch this series like 8 years ago and you're still going????? Kuddos to you brother.
0,"Hey man, not sure if you will see this but I've been watching since episode 1. You're content has always been a feel good time for me so thank you. I want to start clipping your stuff and add it to TikTok. Would you be fine with that? Gives you exposure and hopefully will monetize eventually for me."
0,man i started watching you in middle school and now im in my third year of college studying applied math what a ride huh
0,"Hi Etho! I am 22 going on 23 in June, and I have been watching your videos for a decade now. I started watching you when I was in 5th grade, or 12 years old. I'm a big fan and love to see that you're still posting after all this time. On that note, I have a huge ask. You are approaching episode 600 in your lets play series. I know this may not be a popular opinion BUT.... I think you should start a new world. Your current world has gotten so much love and has so many memories built into it, and I think it will always hold a place in the hearts of many of your viewers. However. Minecraft has changed SO MUCH, you have changed SO MUCH, and I would love to see how that would translate into a brand new world (maybe even a hardcore world, to make it interesting). Whatever you decide, I will watch either way, and I want to thank you for the years of entertainment and memories. Keep it up! - A long time fan"
0,what what episode?
0,"Etho u just keep amazing me. Someone, never stop this man!"
0,"Technical players build everything out of glass, even in places where it is impractical to use glass"
0,"Etho, I have been watching a lot of your videos lately, and you often put your torch on the ground in tunnels.

If you pick a constant and always place torches on the right or left of tunnels & caves you will never get lost.

I always put torches on the right when I am going ""away"" from where I started, and so I can just follow torches on my left to get back."
0,I think it really happened this time...
10,i miss him 😢
0,"With the new Create update, any thoughts are restarting with a new season of the modded series?"
1,Please post another video.  Pretty please with sugar on top.   Pretty please with Maple Sugar on top.... :D
0,laskiwski
7,i miss when etho would upload once a week 😮‍💨 honestly at this point i feel like just not watching his videos for a year just so i can actually have something to watch when i click on his channel (a WHOLE 12 VIDEOS🙄)
0,"Hey, etho, i started a under ground base ! I found a skeleton and zombie spawner within  16 blocks radious ! And 2 cave spider spawners within 14 blocks !! Im so hyped a mineshaft cave with a village on top ❤ its not etho good, but ima make it so nice. You're my inspiration  for this new forever world ❤ ive went back to ur old season 2 videos just to copy ur spawner set up with abit of adjustments  and im using the same glass style like u :)"
0,❤
1,Hey Etho habe you ever played Vintage Story it is a lot like terrfirma?
0,"I think it can be satisfying to build a farm so efficient that you can get passive resources from just standing around doing nothing. But also, there's a limit to how long we can do nothing before getting bored. Lots of players in vanilla multiplayer servers that I've seen have build very efficient farms and are rich in resources. Often, they tend to get bored very fast and stop playing entirely."
1,I'm so happy that etho is still doing good and isn't like the other Minecraft youtubers now in days
0,"I thought you would've got a new update on pc since the last time you mentioned it... 😢 I'm actually ahead. Just a tad bit, but I just bought an 5700x3d for my 2060S. I'm really surprised you haven't upgraded in all this time, and I'm really curious why. 

I would also like to mention that your channel has been dropping considerably in my feed, I really wish I saw it more often on my feed I loved watching all your old content randomly. The mini series like the CTMs and OMG challenge maps like the ones from vexel from yesteryear, I know they're not what are popular now, and they're not the same anymore, but it's always going to be a vibe just chilling and watching drognovia or the dwarves vs zombies videos. It's a shame that just because you're lowering your total output, that your channel will drop in popularity. I've watched this channel since I was 11, and I'm 26, so 15y."
0,"Does this pay the bills? Like I feel like the answer is yes, but other than maybe the members, does youtuber pay the bills at this point in time?"
1,"Etho give us another modpack Please, maybe Team Canada."
0,Wow you are still making videos :D I'm really impressed.
0,"I miss you, Etho. Hope you're doing well."
1,Does Etho still make YouTube videos or does Etho just play Minecraft fishing 🤣🤣🤣
0,"i haven't kept up with you much lately but i'm back and it feels like home. started playing minecraft properly again in the last few days after barely touching it for over a year. i've had the same world for 5.5 yrs, i just start over in new areas with a clear inventory when i get bored instead of doing an entirely new world. i'm keen to get caught up on what you and others are doing in the game. i know you hear this a lot, but it's crazy that i've watched you for half my life now. i found you when i was 12 or 13 and i'll be 26 in a few months. assuming google is correct, that means i'm now the age you were when i was first watching you in 2012. thank you for all of the memories :))"
0,"Wow, randomly stopped by to see if Etho was still uploading! Man is never gonna stop and still gets views, wow"
0,You are still be able to continued till this day😮
0,Been rewatching the whole series love the videos
0,Bro I used to watch you religiously years ago on Feed The Beast and Direwolf videos. At least I think those were the modpacks. How are you still making videos!
1,hi Etho! I just watched Imp and Skizzs podcast and heard you liked to read your comments! I watched your Dwarves vs Zombies videos when I was younger and I absolutely LOVED when you guys played that game-mode. I was just curious if you remember the game and if you think it will return in the future!! I tried finding a server or something that still played DvZ and theres pretty much nothing. 🥹 BUT there are ssooo many people wanting the game-mode to come back and theres even people saying the Hermits could probably reignite that flame! 🤍
0,Just installed honey block elevator in my 7k hardcore world. Thank you
3,11:50 its like when you find money in the pocket of a pair of pants or inside your phone case that you had forgotten you put there
0,"bro how ols is this world now lol, will u release another updated version of ur world?"
0,Etho made a redstonecontraption to replace Bdubs
0,"It would be fun to see you do some modded again. Perhaps on a modded server, even. Like jojosolos’ TCG SMP. Idk if you could get on there though. I hear she only invites friends. ;)"
0,"quick question, what were u thinking when u chose ur skin? cause honestly it kinda reminds me of a certain anime character. Specifically kakashi from naruto. Might just be me tho."
2,"Dearest Etho!!
Do you still read every comment now that you get so many each episode? Also, what’s it like having such a large following now? Do you miss when it used to be smaller?"
0,"Hey etho! Long long time subscriber(since I was like 12 lol), just trying to get back into watching the let’s play as a go to bed series but I feel like I missed so much and every episode you fly over things I missed…. I know they take forever……… but when’s the next world tour?"
0,"Hey Etho, Have you gone to any conventions where you just stay in the crowd hidden and observing?"
0,"You could keep the wolves alive via lingering potions of healing dispensed and hooked up to an Etho hopper clock. Maybe four wolves in total? What do you think of Ethobot? Would you two ever do a video together or not? If you think I'm over loading you on questions, I'm not. Just wanting to have some questions answered."
0,You're almost at 1 billion total channel views. That's insane
0,85
0,10 more episodes until another world tour video!!!
0,"@Etho hey, i keep seeing a newer game of the mod you love called vintage story. Would love to see you play it! I have watched you since i can remember. As soon as i saw the game, I knew you would already be playing it. Would just love to see you play it."
0,this world opened 13 years ago pleaz reponde
0,Stay up big dawg!
0,"etho i had an idea idk if you would be into it. the fallout shelter project is pretty big but its a great idea; i was thinking you could interact with the fans somehow to get designs for each shelter, reddit contests or smth. select winners could get their design put in the world, a fun way to keep the spirit of a “let’s play”"
1,Etho you know how you made a jungle base in hermit craft season 1? Well I think you should have a tradition like every ten hermit craft seasons you make a jungle base you know for memorys
0,Etho is definitely getting some
0,"Etho I've been watching your videos since I was a kid, I am BEGGING you to create a create mod world, there are so many things to do and you'd be so great at it. PLEASE."
1,"Hey etho! For the 600 episode special you should do a clip montage like the 200 episode special, I think it would be really cool to see some highlights over the years. Just an idea"
0,"i’m high asl, i can’t comprehend anything this man is doing, and i love it"
8,"Great to see you still making content, been watching you since I was a kid, I'm now 25. How time flies, hope you're doing well!"
2,"10 year later i still watch ur videos etho. thank you for decades of enjoyment. i also love the problem solving and the nostalgia of the entire world, outro was amazing cause i remember when we built that.. well u but u get the point lol <3"
0,Is this the same world as the one from 14 years ago?
0,Would be great to see Etho back in his prime
0,"What happened to your vault hunters series? I know a lot of people really enjoyee that, including me x10..

Anyways, been watching your videos since the boat dispenser era (probably 10 years ago + at this point. Love what you are doing, and hope you are all good!

Love from Norway!"
1,Ethos videos always make me feel better
0,hey Etho have you ever considered using a mod like Nvidium to get farther chunk render distance?
0,I truly love how ethos has never changed his style through the years honestly the best content creator out there! ❤
0,"love too
 see this channeel isnt dead after all this time"
0,I am new so who is this guy and what did i miss only thing i know about him that he is really good at redstone
0,Dude..It would have been fine with 1 minute of rails.....we would all be damn he did so much 😂
1,"Greetings Mr. Slab!  I thought the arrows could go in the creeper face for it to shoot instead of snowballs! Would be entertaining if you got shot by your own build, enjoy the videos, keep up the amazing work"
0,"Not sure how effective it will be, but maybe layered snow can help with the wolves getting shot? And if you go the route of potions, be careful bc health and regen potions do damage to undead mobs, poison heals them"
0,My minecraft idea of the day is etho finally finishing the library entirely 😂😂
2,I can’t believe it’s the same intro 15 years later or however long it’s been
0,Hi I'm new here can you tell me what's about
1,"I miss old etho vids where we, as viewers, went through the trials of all the things … not this “I’m gunna go mining for some iron” … and next cut … bang diamond beacon and 20,000 obsidian … what happened to the actual play through ? Honestly the cuts hurt… I miss the day by day world growth … I miss old etho … 😢"
0,"""I am batman"" -Iskall85"
0,"Etho, what is your favourite game from the Fallout series?"
0,Decorating the chambers in a fallout theme sounds really fun but its a massive task. But since this is a forever world. You could make it a seasonal event. Like fallout fall. And every year sometime in the fall you decorate one chamber. That way you slowly make progress towards it and have fun with the idea without it becoming a bottleneck. Love the videos etho ❤
3,"I just learned that if you have multiple stacks of the same thing in your inventory when loading things into chests, you just have to pick up a stack, then shift click on another stack of the same thing and itll move everything available into your chest. So life changing."
0,Would the breeze farm count as an AFK farm?
0,Hey Etho. Have you checked out Balatro? It's a very addicting roguelike game that uses poker hands. It feels like your type of game since you're a roguelike fan and I'd be interested if you have played it and what your thoughts on it are.
0,You should put signs with the patch version in the nether tunnels
0,Journey before destination! Etho is a Knight Radiant.
0,I had a dream where Etho collaborated with an environmental activist and made an 8 minute minecraft asmr video building an igloo.
0,I know you probably won’t see this comment but I’d really love to see a new world tour and world download
1,"The pale garden immediately makes me think of the lost forest from the legend of zelda series of games, having something similar with puzzles and other things would be awesome."
0,"Etho I've tried your sandwich. You have impeccable taste. I use homemade sourdough instead of a baguette, but I've been digging this thing. One thing I would highly recommend is you put some olive oil on it. It really takes your 9.5/10 sandwich to a 10/10."
0,"""This is a fully vanilla world""

We don't talk about episode 404"
0,"I'm sure there's a mod for this, but it would be cool if there was a way to make a single chunk in the Nether coordinate 1:1 in the overworld, opposed to 8:1

And Etho, do you ever rewatch your old videos? If so, what's the video you've gone back to the most? Hope you're enjoying the snow!"
0,Seeing jardon fish and looking at ethos score was a little redonk
0,I think etho should make a black and white themed old tv kind themed house with the new pale blocks and color grain
0,28:44 supervillain lair
0,The rollercoaster could be use to tell a story
0,"I’d love to see more building and prettying up high traffic areas in the world, especially near farms you grind at like the tree farm."
0,the first ep of this series was 14 years ago u kidding me this is the definition of forever world
0,Give your world to Tommy ininit
0,The scale of that project is beyond my comprehension 🤯👏
0,"Been watching you for years, and you never fail to inspire me to play MC again.  You are a legend."
0,"Hey etho loving the new video, your the only youtuber I watch that pays Minecraft, I don't even play Minecraft any more I just really enjoy your videos no matter what game you play, your videos are just really engaging, I have watched you from when your lets play world  was about a year in, seems like it wasn't that long ago but it defi is lol, hope your keep up the good videos, I think I will probably always watch your videos, another fun fact your videos are the only videos that YouTube consistently show to me as soon as they come out lol"
12,"So close to episode 600, it's crazy to think this series has been going on for over 10 years. Growing up watching every single episode evolve over time. It reminds me how crazy it is that even the biggest creator on the platform Mrbeast was a fan too in the Mindcrack days. And also an opinion on the new biome. It is interesting how they just reuse and re texture game mechanics that are already in the game. The trees are retextured dark oak, the planks are white textured oak planks, the new moss is re-textured original moss. I guess it is more of a building pallet now and now we have a larger variety for us to choose from. Anyway. Thank you for the entertainment Etho! As always, it doesn't go unappreciated."
3,"In your video ""Etho Plays Minecraft - Episode 456 Ender Ender 3 0"", the point when you name tagged the endermite happened so fast I missed it. I spawned and lost 3 endermites before rewatch the video paying more attention to that part of the video. Thanks for your detail explanations. Instead of having to go 128 block out, I made the killing chamber next to the spawn platform and slabbed inside the spawn sphere (work in progress). I am 70, my grandson got me hooked, have done several worlds, been in the current one 6782 days,"
0,"You only hear of a hen, a rooster, and a chicken. Something's missing!"
1,"I want Blue Stone I don't know what it would do but I want it lol

Blue sparkly 😍"
1,"Hi Ethooo, when u said ""and thennn"" 2:00 i realized u have a good villain voice
You have a super awesome voice in general. 😈😋"
1,Really enjoyed this :) love love love an Etho LP ‘variety episode’ so much! Very very comforting and impressive in equal measure!
1,"been watching you for over 11 years. 24, and am in medical school now. geez"
1,The real etho.
0,Amazing video
0,holy shi this guy still posts the same world thats so crazy
0,Thank you Etho!
0,"Hello Etho! I'm Maria and I'm not a big gamer myself but my partner, Ethan, is and they are a big fan of your videos. We've been together for about 3 months now but they told me they've been watching you for the longest, have watched each of your videos even. There's been times we have a meal together and watching something on the screen, but when they see a video of yours dropped they get so excited and put it on immediately. I watched this video to get more a sense of why they enjoy your videos, your chuckles are so heartwarming while talking through what you're doing to your viewers. 

For Valentine's day, I wanted to get them a more emotional and significant gift rather than just physical gifts. Anyways, I was hoping you can give a quick shoutout in the comments to Ethan? Well, Ene is their gamer tag but I think they'd be stoked to see recognition from you either way! It'd be so sick if you could, thanks for your time Etho and your videos :))"
0,I'm still kinda sad there was no 10 year anniversary for the series...

1,Etho I don’t play or watch Minecraft much anymore but every couple months a video of yours will pop up. I’m happy to see you’re still going strong and doing well. Keep up the good work man
0,Please do a new world tour it's been 4 years 🎉😅😊

0,I really wish Etho would do live streams it could just be him ollecting resources i would still watch NEED MORE ETHO CONTENTTT!!!
0,"7 minutes and 15 seconds!  That's how long the track is.  I wonder how much quicker you could get it if you used all powered rails (I know that's unnecessarily excessive, but I'd be curious)"

0,"The afk vs not afking debate in survival minecraft is interesting to me. I've personally leaned into afking because I've always seen it as time shifting. Like how when VCR's first became a product that the average person can buy and use to record TV shows to watch later, most people that have them leaned into the habit of recording shows to watch later. As a veteran survival minecraft player, and redstoner, I've just gotten into the desire, and habit of just building the most efficient, some might even call them OP, and afkable farm designs that I can find and calling it done. But seeing the ways that other people play the game has been an eye opener to me. 

Why I compare afking at farms in minecraft to tapeing TV shows is it enables a playstyle of being able to freely get resources for large projects, allow me to spend the time I'd otherwise have to spend grinding for resources ingame, playing other games, doing other things at my computer or even doing IRL things like chores and cooking food while my farm in my minecraft world makes resources for me. And then a few hours to maybe even a few days later, I have all the resources I need for my mega project and then some. 

I do understand why some people see afking as taking the fun and joy out of gathering resources yourself, or at least operating a farm yourself ingame and interacting with it rather than just letting it run in the background. This is the beauty of minecraft, in that there really is no ""wrong"" way to do things, everyone has a diff playstyle that is unique to only themselves and their personal values.

Me from 5 years ago would have scoffed at Etho's no afking rule and made fun of it, but today I totally see that everyone plays the game differently and why they play it differently, and I'd frankly find the world to be boring if every single minecraft player have my exact same playstyle."
1,I like the energy of this episode
0,Hey Etho have you heard about Cobblemon? The new pokemon minecraft mod. I loved your pixelmon series would you consider doing another pokemon series in Cobblemon?
0,It's crazy to me that I have been watching you play in this world for years! keep it up
0,Today February 11 is my birthday. I saved this episode to watch it on!!!! My 24th been watching you since I was 12
0,Did my favorite YouTuber just mention my favorite show?! Silo shout-out!
1,This is etho’s “I mined a few hours off camera” episode
0,"Hey Etho, you must have thousands of nether portals. How do you keep track of all of them? Thank you for all the amazing video!"
0,"I would love to see each of the chambers themed, that would be amazing and you could progressively work on them when you have interest. That said, yes it is a huge project and I honestly never expect to see it 😅"
0,Is etho a fan of Kakashi?
0,"Hey Etho! I’ve been studying to become a lawyer for a little bit, and the case United States v. Kane was suggested to me. In it, two men exploited a software error on digital slot machines to win half a million dollars. Two points were paramount: whether the slot machine constituted a “protected computer” under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and whether the men had “exceeded authorized access.” The court ruled that, although it was a protected computer, the men had simply pressed buttons in a way they were legally entitled to do, and they kept the money. Moral of the story, you should definitely be allowed to exploit bugs for your vanilla playthrough. It didn't come up in this video, but it has before. On the other hand, if exploiting a bug ruins your fun, don't do it. That would defeat the purpose of the playthrough for everyone. Keep up the good work!"
0,U could do a segment on your next world tour (probably ep 600 like u said) where u read old comments of the day
2,"Etho I know what you're wondering and the answer is yes, we are ready for season 4 of TerraFirmaCraft"
0,A metro inspired theme would be really neat
1,"About the decorating absolutely yes on the fallout idea, I'm a big fan on your Minecraft Vanilla series I've just haven't been active on  YouTube and Unsubscribed to a lot of people and I'm glad i cam back in the right moment, please do the fallout idea for decor it made me smile, keep up the good videos. ❤‍🔥 Keep rocking on. 🤘"
0,remember to like the video. Ergo is too goated to ever remind us
1,Went to MEGACON this year and one of the coolest cosplay we saw was someone as Etho. They had life series hearts donning their cosplay but the real giveaway was the maple syrup bottle :)
0,would regen beacons for the dogs work?
0,"such a coool and huge mobfarm! About getting player kills, wouldnt the trick of shooting tnt with an arrow to make the tnt count as player kill work pretty well for here? like was done with one of the previous endermen farms."
0,"I'm looking forward for episode 600, it should be by the middle of 2027 so my schedule should be open"
0,Enjoyed the 30 minute mine cart ride can u be my valentine
0,oh yeah
0,I’ve been watching you for literally 11 years man. Thank etho. You get more love than anyone on YouTube!
0,"Hey, Mr. Etho! What kind of games have you been playing when you're not playing minecraft, if any? But more importantly, have you seen or maybe even played Vintage Story? Its a great game that I think you would enjoy playing (and us watching you play) since you loved TerraFirmaCraft way back in the day."
0,"I would say I don't AFK.
But I do have Carpet mod, and spawn in users to afk for me.
On that note, I have to go check how much slime Pearl afk'd for me last night."
0,"Maybe you could have piglins with looting swords who get hit but the mobs attack and then retaliate. And to keep a health topped up, name a vindicator cap ""Johnny"" to get a witch to spam regen potions"
0,Mr LavaMan
0,Compilation of all the Old videos for 600? 🧐
0,"I'm currently making my way through Etho's entire Let's Play series, and am at episode 204. But I've also been watching the latest couple of episodes -- the difference in his voice and delivery is amazing! And of course the game has changed a LOT since 2012. It's been ~12 years since ep 204 and you can really tell. Both versions of Etho are super entertaining though!"
0,"Comment of the day, cotd, Etho with us switching to the age of ai (artificial intelligence) how have you used ai apart of your YouTube career? You are a person that enjoys his processes, systems, and automations. So i am curious if you have used an LLM or Ai agent to help in your processing of youtube or daily life."
0,Did Etho just say... Journey before destination?? Secret Sanderson fan??
0,ergo's back!!!🎉🎉🎉
0,"Etho is the main character when it comes to Minecraft. He got the sickest looking Pale Oak biome EVER, with shattered peaks and EXPOSED LUSH CAVES. Not to mention it only goes TO THE WORLD HEIGHT LIMIT. He is so spoiled with that generation, I almost don't believe that's a Vanilla world."

0,Excited for 600
0,I think it's time for once to comment. I believe this year marks 11 years of Etho for me. And I want to thank you for still going strong. You have been an important part of my life and I wish all the best for you.
0,20:08 Big Blue balling... Stopped right at the good part. T_T
0,"What happened to the modded series?
I know you had some issues with it before as your game crashed and stopped working etc. But just curious as i'm someone who never really plays modded but seeing all the stuff was always super fun and interesting"
0,"Etho, would you ever consider playing Gregtech New Horizons? Its a modpack you might have heard of that is all about designing complex systems."
0,Hi Etho! I love watching you as I eat my sandwich during lunch. I was wondering which farm/project is the oldest that remains completely unchanged and you still use consistently? Thanks for the awesome and creative content!
1,Etho is your taste for onions still low?
0,Episode 600 world tour coming up! Hopefully we get it in 2025

0,"One thing you should is put a way to know how far along the trial path you are.
Like a counter, or banner with a number."
0,"Hey Etho, have you ever had problems with RSI? One vacation I played Minecraft for 8 (or probably longer) hours per day, four days in a row, and by then my (mouse hand) wrist started hurting. It went away again by the end of the week, but I learned my lesson to keep it in moderation. Is maybe your unique mouse placement a factor to prevent/avoid this issue? Or maybe your joints just aren't predisposed to this. Stay healthy : )"
0,"1.21? damn, i'm way behind, when did we hit the twenties"
0,I feel like @malign3158 will be happy the lighting is hidden at the fishing hut. Their comments from episode 294 onwards about the torches at the fishing hut are crack up.

0,sticky and slab
0,Awesome video.
0,"I DID enjoy this one, thanks Mr Etho!"
0,I love Jesus.
0,So Etho just create the stock market
0,Could it really be an Etho video?
0,"I have envied Etho's base building ability for years now.

I just live in boxes underground to hide my shame."
0,"Regarding the dogs... Do they attack quicker than skeletons? Maybe because of bow drawing? So maybe quickly opening some trap doors would work?
Or maybe you could just play with line of sight - place a trap door above the dogs or something like that?"
0,Hey Etho! I think a factory build would be a cool build for the Pale Garden! Maybe that'd be a great place for a resin farm. Keep up the good work!
0,Emerald city 2.0 after the fall
0,I didn't even know there was an mc update. I'd like to see you explore the new features :D
0,:)
0,I loved the nighttime song moment! So funny 😆
0,You should do the 12 different colony idea just spread it out to be like 1 a month! Then you won’t be bogged down coming up with 12 ideas and building them all. Just give us a little present every month and build it all off camera!
0,Excited for 600! Love world tours.
2,"The way I binge-watched the entirety of Project Ozone between episodes XD welcome back, Etho! <3"
0,Alway love your amazing content! Have a great day too!
0,"please never change the intro, been watching since the first videos and I love being taken back everytime a new video starts"
0,Best episode so far. Thx Etho
0,how did I miss this?! I guess I haven't been on YouTube for 2 days.
0,"etho could you set up an enderpearl porter to bring you back to the start to really fill it out? idk how the trials spawners work otherthan what you described, but that would be sick to port back to the start"
0,Etho knows good TV. Silo is top tier.
0,You should hook up some farms along the mine track and other redstone stuff that get triggered
0,Why don't you take Amplified off now for new terrain generation?
0,"ooh the moss vines, very cool"
0,Use the arrows from the skeletons to shoot the breezes
0,It’s always a good day when a new EPMC drops
0,congrats on #1 in fishing :O!! and lovely to see you back in your single player world!! I think the plan to do smaller projects is a nice balance between these big ones. it makes them all seem so nice and approachable
0,"When I was a kid, this would have been something I obsessed over. I hope there are kids now who are feeling the way I used to with minecraft. 

I don't really care bout MC anymore. Ahhh"
0,"Hey Etho, I know you like to do the hour and a half world tours to celebrate x00 or x50 episode milestones, but for episode 600 or for a special episode, I would love to see a multi hour full in depth tour of EVERYTHING in the world you can remember doing.  I've been watching the series for around 12/13 years and world tours are always a favorite of mine to watch. I like the brief summaries of your creation's reason for existing,  its use case, and then why mojang broke your build or why you moved onto something better. I know that a lot of people might not want to sit through an episode this long which is why it might not be worth making, but I hope you can make this happen. 

Also, I do like the idea of returning to a video style where you maybe work on 2/3 fun small projects in a video rather than 1 really large project per episode."
0,"5:40 ""seems like there are no mobs outside the portal there"" *casually dodges a skeleton arrow right before"
1,"Looks like we need another round of ""Arrow Rain"" to dispense all these freshly-farmed arrows piling up"

1,Here from Verlisify’s Video on the TNT Duping problem. You are a cool dude. Keep up the good work and you earned a subscriber.
0,Could you add a big number to the wall of each trial chamber? Like indicating the different stops on a subway?
0,I dug out a vertical silo under my base when I saw the first season of silo! it's still WIP but it's moving along nicely
0,"The fact I have been watching this series for so long and the content has been so consistent and amazing. Truly thank you etho, so much"
0,You're good stuff Etho!
0,"In this age of uncertainty, Etho publishing an LP episode brings so much needed joy!"
0,"One might say copying text from a book with Ctrl+C to a txt file with Ctrl+V, then saving, copying that text with Ctrl+C when you're logged in HC and pastimg with Ctrl+V to the book there might be easier then having 2 instances ofMC open 😅
You must be tired and having those brainfart moments like we all do. 😂"

0,With another one
0,He back
0,"Yo 2025 will be great, we will get around 4-6 new Etho videos :) Can't wait to see you in 2 months for the next one! Keep it up, Etho, you're doing great and gz to 1st place in Fishing :D"
0,Yayyy ethos back
0,I’ve never actually tried bundles before. It feels like an inventory menu within an inventory menu.
0,etho is my childhood youtuber im 21 now and seeing this video come up on my suggestions just put a smile on my face
0,25:50 was just wholesome
0,hey etho! you should put target blocks in the trial chamber farm. shoot arrows at them as you go through it for fun.
0,"Just saw the picture of your setup, if that’s actually your setup then I appreciate you more, very humble setup. Perfect example of if it’s not broken don’t fix it."
0,I just realised that watching Etho since my childhood might be why I like watching ManlyBadassHero. Its how chill they sound
1,18:00 😂😂😂
0,ETHOOOO!
0,"How many days go by after posting a video do you stop reading the comments on that video, I try comment right away as soon as I see the video come out and I watch it"
0,you're an absolute madman. 🤯
0,"It would be nice if you could limit skulk sensors to friendly mobs being damaged, rather than all mobs."
0,Etho I will just watch you talk xD
0,I love variety episodes! Please do some :D
0,Not even 5 minutes in and my mind is already blown. You have done it again Etho.
0,After 590 episodes I don’t know how you can continue to blow my mind. This is incredible!
0,Cdb
0,I suddenly get the impression etho has read the stormlight archive....
0,ETHO ISN'T DEAD CRAB RAVE
0,"I like the idea of the ""idea section"" until the ideas are not cub bs like removing nether roof, I mean.. Minecraft is a tool and removing a feature of a tool is a bad bad thing, but for some reason I completely trust Etho not to think Minecraft is just a game that needs buff and nerfs"
0,10:49 I‘d love that!
0,"This was the most nostalgic intro so far. I had to check for a second if I really had opened the latest video, and not the episode where the fishing song originated from! And the 3 correct ways to pronounce lava were delivered perfectly! This already made my day 😊"
0,I ate so many snacks
0,Etho making an F Zero reference was not on my bingo card
0,You know... considering that computing the shortest circuit connecting N locations is literally an infamous NP-Hard problem only known to be solvable in exponential time.... I'm sure you did pretty alright in constructing that rail network.
0,Love the videos man I’ve been watching for over a decade and still my favorite way to end any night!
0,Bdubs is going to steal that sleep alarm one day lol
0,"Welcome back from your fishing vacation, Etho!"
0,"Hey etho for your breeze kill test sperator idea try slabs at top of the 1/2 under you glass tube so can still hit the breeze through the other 1/2 but, may make them unable to attack you back"
0,"The vaults idea sounds insane, DO IT!"
0,Journey before destination.
0,sometimes i like to imagine that etho irl is the “nature king” guy on tiktok who builds like entire igloos out of snow and lives in it for a few days
0,"No joke, I've had a falling out with a friend who grew up watching you just like myself, and we really bonded over that. We used to notify each other whenever you put out a new episode.... The sound of your voice choked me up cause you've been there since I was in grade school and now I'm here at my big boy tech job enjoying your content and same voice just the same. Thanks for never changing Etho."
0,Am updated world tour would be awesome for 600 or even just at all.
0,"As someone who loves to appear on MCCI, it has always been funny to watch Etho climb up the ranks in fishing. Man’s addicted to it, it’s great xd"
0,"36:01 journey before destination, etho is a knight radiant confirmed"
0,The patience this man has to do this is crazy 😂
0,The fallout idea would be awesome
1,I like the idea of the Minecraft idea of the day. I like your input about how Minecraft could be different
0,Welcome to America as the 51st
0,"I’ve had this idea for building a black and white kind of village or Minecraft world inside of the pale gardens. 

Minecraft has so many different shades of blacks, whites and greys now. I don’t have any building knowledge though. If anyone sees this and wants to do it, PLEASE take the idea. I want to see it so bad!"
0,This is crazy cool!
0,Nice to see Etho interacting with his fellow weeping angels.
0,"22:00 - Bundles have also been growing on me. Since your last episode I've been doing a similar thing in my inventory. A trash bag for random items, plus a ""Day Bag"" for my useful stuff like Ender Chests, Scaffolding, a couple of Chests, an Anvil, Furnace, other bits.

I've also taken out one slot in each of the Shulkers in my Ender Chest system and put a bundle in there for the 'off cuts' for when I'm building things. Any leftover sticks, stairs, slabs, etc go into their related bin bag and I can just dig through there quickly before crafting more stairs or whatever on my next project."
0,Thank you for the sculk sensor book. Literally working through this today
0,I don't ever wanna hear the term washed again. This is one of the most innovative things I have seen in awhile!
0,Upload more
0,"Hey Etho, have you ever thought about going back to Terraria or playing satisfactory (2 very different games I know)? I remember you saying that your channel does a lot better with specifically Minecraft but I personally would love to watch you play through either of those games and I’m sure I’m not the only one."
0,Best intro by a long cast.
1,Question: Would you recommend for other people who want to start their forever world in amplified? I'm debating rn
0,36:00 JOURNEY BEFORE DESTINATION RADIANT
0,Good to see you again :)
1,27:28 /locate ... isnt that cheating ??
0,"Been watching Silo with friends who have the Apple TV service -- one or two episodes per visit, so it's slow going lol.  It's so good.  Gotta say it's also refreshing that it's not a YA thing for a change.

At least multiple trial chambers means that decoration naturally breaks out into chunks (no pun intended).  That way it's a lot of little projects that can be done between other things as time, inclination, and inspiration allow."
0,Only two months wait this time 🤣
0,Would you do a q&a in hermit craft next two episodes?
0,26:27 All I can think about is Crash Bandicoot jumping on the big Wompa crates when there's one on top too.
0,the Bell for the trade system when its time to sleep reminded me of the Zelda: Majora's mask clock town tower lol
1,"15:11 I thought the same thing Etho - it used to work like that, but apparently they changed it like a decade ago to not apply looting😭"
0,"Congrats on first place haha, was fun watching you climb and fishing along while cheering you on."
0,"Welcome back from fishing! Jealous of your first pale garden! Mine was, I kid you not, three trees. No flowers, no special mob. Just three sad little trees on a small moss patch. I will have to fly another direction and try again."
0,"Etho, please, you have to tell me: how did you get the llamas to walk around sandy city like that?"
0,"Wild life made Etho try bundles, what a development"
0,It's my birthday in two weeks and the thing i'd love more than anything is to revisit the Simon Sats project! Love your videos forever thank you Etho!
0,"Hey Etho,
Do you ever regret making your world amplified. It always looks nice, but can be a bit extreme for building some times. Also with new generation changes, it doesn’t allow for some designed spaces, like the groves"
0,omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
68,"*NOTE:* The following is from a mod-developer point-of-view; I have no idea what goes on in Mojang's offices. I just know what I've seen of their code.
23:00 - To be fair to Mojang, the Server (where the Sculk lives) doesn't know about a good chunk of sounds that happen. Even when playing in a Singleplayer world, the Logical Server doesn't know when most _sounds_ get played; so therefore, neither does the Sculk. Instead, Sculk works off an Event-based system. That's the list of signal strengths Etho mentions.

This is done for performance and simplicity; for example - footsteps. Sending _every_ footstep sound event over the network _every_ time a mob moves to _every_ player in range would take up a ton of bandwidth _and_ would require that the server check who is in range to try and minimize the bandwidth cost (which can be a fairly taxing calculation.)
Instead, the client handles sounds, for the most part. When it gets an update from the server saying ""this mob within your entity distance moved enough for me to tell you about it"" the client goes ""ok cool"" and rolls a random chance to play a footstep sound, so long as the mob is within range. (And like a billion other things but they're not relevant.)

This has drawbacks, obviously, but is the best of both worlds - you get footstep sounds when mobs move, and the server doesn't have to manage it. The drawbacks in comparison are well worth it, from a developer's point of view:
1. Sounds that ARE synchronized that have random variants (a very small and avoidable group) aren't guaranteed to be the same between players (oh no.. anyways)
2. Things that live purely on the Server have no way of knowing what or when sounds are played. (The problem we've encountered)

Heck, things that live on the Client can also have a hard time knowing exactly what sound is _currently_ playing at any given time, due to how sounds themselves are triggered and then just left to their own devices. Though, that's more of a ""how computers tend to handle sound"" issue than an implementation issue."
1,I love the fallout/Silo idea!
1,"If you're getting so many arrows, why not use the arrows to kill them?"
3,"26:20 Mojang is pretty hardset on not adding new ""animals"" with drops or adding drops to existing mobs that represent animals because they don't want to promote animal cruelty. We may see something like this in a future mob that doesn't reflect a real life animal, but it's unlikely it'll ever happen with bats and that they will remain useless forever unfortunately."
0,RAH ETHO
0,"I wonder what your thoughts on Outer Wilds would be if you decided to play it. I hope you would like it, even if it's not your usual style ^^"
0,I’ve been rewatching your entire lp series and I just saw where you had a list of projects that need finished and you would either pick one for the episode or let the viewers pick. That would be a good way to implement finishing the smaller projects!
0,"Question : How do you feel about the different types of animals (chickens, cow, and pig) they are adding to the game? As far as I know they add no other purpose other than basically being decoration as far as I know. They are also adding new desert updates (Cactus and the desert grass). Do you feel like Minecraft is getting repetitive adding different types (like they did for Dogs) or do you think it's good?"
0,"hi etho! Its great to hear you're thinking of moving back to smaller projects and finishing touches. Of course the big projects are cool, but some of my favorite bits from the last few episodes has been your work on your world's infrastructure! 
Would love to see some love and attention given to some heavy traffic areas in your world such as the stronghold."
0,"The color of Pale Gardens is so pale, what I think would be nice is using the Color Pop photography technique. Individual monochromatic buildings in different colors that totally pop."
0,"Hey Etho! I know you when you build redstone underground, you always place stone bricks under it so you dont accidentally destroy anything. Has there been a time that this has saved you from breaking a project?"
0,Those open nether bridges give me anxiety.
0,Welcome back men. Hope you are ok...we lost you a little bit.
0,i want an Etho Plays Valheim Video. No afk farms there for sure! :)
0,World tour cleanup is my favorite recurring series. Can't wait!
0,"Bro, I genuinely forgot you existed hahahaha damn, I'm going to enjoy these 36 minutes of nostalgia"
0,"""But we dont need to see the return trip""

0,"i went out of my way to get snacks (grilled chicken quarters + fuzetea) :)
thank you for making these videos"
0,"Decorating the new farm like your described sounds like a massive project, but it also sounds incredibly cool."
2,"Journey before Destination, Etho!"
0,"I've missed my dose of Etho. I really like the idea of decorating the farm like fallout style, also I don't know if I'm the only one, but probably the last year or so you're the only person I really watch of Minecraft now, so I don't have a clue about any of the new stuff lol, so I love it when you show us. Keep up the great work Etho!"
1,“Episode 600 pretty soon here” Etho we all know that’s coming in 2026😂
0,"Thanks for the video, Etho! Just wanted to let you know that I don't consume any Minecraft content besides yours, so I still like seeing you go through and explain the new update even though everybody else probably knows about it. Great video as always!"
0,the title makes me think of green eggs and ham for some reason.
0,25:51 AAHH!! im smiling so big listening to the song. didn't expect it. but it's so cute. i love it.
0,"Hey Etho!  For the dogs, do you think trapdoors or halfslabs underneath the pistons might work?  I don't know if they can see/attack through them, but.. In theory they would block the arrow in its path?"
0,"“This is a trouble spot, it seems like no mobs are outside of the portal” COMPLETELY missing the fact that an arrow narrowly missed his head"
0,"I've never thought of afk-ing like that before, and you are so right! I tend to make my farms very spread out, but if I must be present while the farms are running I am more likely to build around them and decorate them."
0,"If you have a good supply of scute from armadillos, you could use Wolf Armor to protect the wolves and set up a calibrated skulk sensor to detect when the armor breaks, using a piston to lower the dog, sadly you can't dispense wolf armor onto the wolf. Maybe have either just 1 Dog on either side with wool between them and bounce the dogs side to side with it set that if the armor breaks, it pushes the dog into a safe spot and maybe have a few backup dogs ready to replace them.
Also you can enchant the wolf armor with things like Unbreaking and Protection, though I guess prot doesn't really matter since the armor blocks all damage anyways."
0,"Slightly too fast to reach a few of those stops, might have to move the booster rails a little if it consistantly ends up ahead of the spawn timer, but the last 10% always takes 90% of the time."
0,Hey Etho for question of the day. What do you plan on doing with the breeze rods from your breeze farm?
0,Ain’t no way etho only rocking a rtx 2060 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
0,"My Minecraft idea is to have enchantable horseshoes, they could have enchants that improve jump height or run speed, there could be an ‘awareness’ sort of enchant that make them rear/stop before falling from a height. They could have Frostwalker so you could use your horse on long early game adventures. It would make having a horse feel like a progression based part of Minecraft rather than the sort of ‘endless breeding simulator’ that it is."
0,"Etho, I am rewatching ALL of your LP videos and I just realized that almost nothing changed in your base and that’s so cool."
0,"Hey Etho, yours are the only videos i DON""T watch in 1.25 speed. :)"
11,"I was in middle school when that library was built, now I’m about to graduate college. Holy hell, you’ve been a constant in my life man, thank you."
0,"Congrats on winning the fishing! Wow, it just keeps going, amazing system of trial chambers! And I love your idea to decorate them with a connecting story! Using the redstone lectern comparator control book to also list what signals the sculk sensor responds to at each level is brilliant! The pale garden looks incredible in your amplified terrain world, I love how the sky changed colour as you flew up into it and then revealed just how massive it is!! And yes I agree definitely build something industrial to have the grey sky be smog! LOL amazing that you just happened to be close enough to build height that the tree couldn't grow!"

0,I just thought man i havent watched etho in a while. And an upload less than a day ago? Hell yeah
0,Etho I love your videos. Have you watched Invincible? If not you should definitely watch it trust me.
0,"Although impractical due to the fact they're in the nether post collection, another form of player kill attributed damage is flint and steel lit tnt, which could speed up the killing process and deal universal damage to all mobs."
0,Did Etho leak that info about a future installment of the Life series? Or was that common knowledge
0,"Hay etho, do you have secret passesges in your world that most people don't know about?"
1,"I know you can’t actually comment on this because it would likely end very poorly for you, but I personally am very curious on your opinion of the whole Iskall thing. Since you two are (were…?) such good friends."

1,"Hey Etho, Love your content. as your coming up on your 600 LP,  your in a unique position to do something really Great.. you should put your world on a server for a day and let all the Hermits come visit and give there feed back Etc. or something of that sort😍"
0,"How to prevent dogs taking damage in the farm. Make a farm for armadillo scutes (smaller project and an uncommon farm) and put dog armour on all the dogs. You can maybe do some dispenser magic with them too, I am personally not sure. Great episode Etho, got some minecart ideas now. For example, connect all the areas in your world with them and this way, you made an epic ride."
0,"Regarding the AFK rule logic mentioned in this episode:  You could say the same thing about any fully automated farm.  I build a chicken farm, and suddenly I have zero worries about food.  Seems like that disrupts resource management just as much as AFK.  You could just look at it like another difficulty setting.  We could all play hardcore with no farms if we wanted to."

0,"Trading hall audio cue idea: In Japan stores will play a song called Hotaru no Hikari (蛍の光) for about 10-15 minutes before closing time to signify the store is about to close. It would be so cool if you used it for the trading hall right before trading time ends. Especially if the audio ends when trading time ends. 

Bonus: it would be incredibly enjoyable for your japanese viewers (which I imagine is relatively few). 

I believe it’s public domain (same melody as a Scottish folk song)"

0,"I think that the washed out colors of the new forest are spooky. Your particular biome has such extreme terrain that I think it would be cool to have a haunted airship stuck levitating over the forest. Maybe with new moss and vines growing from it. The new leaves could be incorporated into parts of it to get the particle effects drifting down. The heart particle effects could perhaps give the impression of sparks. From the ship, you'd get a great view of the terrain and atmosphere."

It's a  standalone game similar to what TerraFirmaCraft is. You should check it out!"

0,They turned the sun institutional grey. Pretty impressive. (c)

0,How is Etho still this consistent after over 10 years?? Every episode is high quality
0,"There's something special about Etho minecarting through a funky project and chatting, a match made in heaven!

Question: Over the years, have you collected any MInecraft merchandise?"

0,Etho I could watch you play hearthstone forever pleaseeee make another hearthstone video ive seen your playlist like 10+ times
0,"Love ya etho, my childhood still goes strong"
0,"It all comes down to what you enjoy in a game.
Sandbox games like minecraft are best when they allow you to focus on what you enjoy doing and forget or minimize the things you don't.
I like the survival aspects - having to deal with mobs, scaffolding, no flight, getting better gear to survive easier, getting resources and building automatic farms, recently mainly small ones that will only produce necessary amounts when Im around them, and then moderately easily collecting the resources for builds I focus on. I sometimes afk at the farms if they doesnt keep up with what im doing and/or I have other things to do and I can leave mc running in the background. Saying ""I should just play creative"" doesnt really make much sense, survival with afk isn't nearly comparable to creative.
It's like saying if someone likes Ice cream they should just eat snow instead, it has less sugar. You can do either, but only the ""framework"" is the same, and the things that make you choose one over the other are probably what matter most to the people doing it. I like the hustle of building an automatic farm, like the games factorio and satisfactory, it's satisfying to BUILD something that then makes your life easier, that does something automatically, and seeing it work. Especially things that turns the task you enjoy least, which may normally a long boring process, and instead you can just open a chest for a hit of dopamine as you see your time investment into the farm paying off, feel the relief of not having to do that thing and instead you have time to do things you enjoy most.
And then there's the concept of ""improvement"" even in respect to a farm. For me the best improvement for farms is making them smaller, lighter, easier to build, reliable. If they can be small enough to run when Im in the main base, that's a massive bonus. I never cared much about massive farms, they're cool to watch but pretty much useless unless you play on a big server where many people can make use of it. the hours spent on building and travelling to a massive farm will literally never pay off in time spent over a farm you could build in 10min you can keep in your base if the latter will satisfy your needs."

0,"Give me a second, I need to move this onto my main monitor."
0,Thanks Legend Fisher 😊
0,"Etho you're back to 2nd place, please come back and fish with us!"
0,"I really like your trial chamber decoration idea - as you were traveling through i was thinking how cool the chamber layout is, it would be good if you could preserve that somewhat whilst making it look more polished and complete. It would take a while, but because there are multiple trial chambers (and connecting nether tunnels) it would be easy to separate it into multiple smaller tasks e.g. work on getting one chamber looking nice, then leave it for a while and do something else.

I agree with the bat drop idea, I think that whilst adding late-game content is great, some players (me lol) just don't really want to do those things, and it would be nice if there was another way to get some of the useful items without devaluing the effort required. 

Also congrats on becoming the #1 MMCI fishing champion!"
0,"""Oohh its on top of the world. Thats y."""
0,"As a person that loves idle games, my goal in minecraft is to literally automate everything and have enough storage for it all, and I’d just need to afk at base, I’ve gotten really close but it does take a long time, and I do afk a lot.

0,he is back!!!
0,The lava pronunciation at the start had me in tears!!!
0,Another AWESOME episode! You GO ETHO! 🤩🤩🤩 Yeah man.
5,Important info about wolves for you etho: I did some digging in the Minecraft bug tracker and can confirm wolves will only attack skeletons when the skeleton can see (and therefore will shoot at) the wolf. This was reported as a bug in issue MC-148047 but is unresolved for ages so probably it's intended behaviour. The bug even shows a similar setup of wolves in mine carts not attacking a skeleton who's line of sight is blocked. I think you're going to have to come up with some engineered solution unfortunately.
0,Still hoping you keep playing your Modded series....

Cheers Etho thanks brother"

Lol bro... I watched the episode 500 world tour episode when my daughter was around a year old. She's fixing to be 8 😂. That episode is like... A year away."

0,"Closing in on episode 600, super long episode then (10 hours or something LOL J/K) can't get enough Etho in my life?

Edit: lol i posted comment about this at the start of the episode xD Kinda funny you bring it up in the vid too."
0,lol etho’s seen fallout?? I didn’t know he was chill like that! Man it would be soo cool if you did vaults like from fallout but each one got progressively worse so like the first vault was normal and worked perfectly but as you got later the vaults got more disheveled and destroyed kind of like how in the fallout universe a lot of the vaults were evil and used for experimentation and ended up destroying themselves from within

What are your feelings on Notch making a new game?"
0,"Terraria has four ender chest functioning items. one is the piggy bank, you are familiar with it. the safe, less functions on that one. the void bag, picks up items that don't fit in your inventory. then, if you really want more, there is the forge from the Tavern Keep from the Old One's Army.

Terraria also has items stacking to 9,999... and minecraft... needs you to place ender chests down, then get the Shulker Box place that down, get what you need, then break the box, put it back in the ender chest, and likely use a Silk Touch Pickaxe to clean up your fetch quest. it's worse than before the piggy bank got the Money Trough in Terraria."

dude, it took until february to get the first ep, it'll take at least a year to get 10 more xD"

0,20:53 GOTTA SHREEP! 😊
0,"Referring to the comment of the day, I think you have to bare in mind that the majority of players don't have the luxury of playing minecraft as a Job. A lot of us have very limited time to play after school/ work when we just want to chill for a bit. 

If we didn't AFK at farms to gather resources then we'd be spending most of our limited gaming time manually gathering resources or manually using farms. 

I will build AFK farms for most items and then do an overnight AFK session to stock up on that item. So the next time I need a lot of it for a project I can just collect it and go, rather than having to spend IRL days manually gathering it. I don't often disagree with you but I don't agree with the ""you may as well play creative"" comment. We are still putting in the time, effort and resources to build these farms to get the desired resources back."
0,"I don't quite agree with the comments on the sculk sensor. You can actually sort of record the sound you want to detect. Place a sculk sensor, a comparator, and some redstone and see how much redstone turns on when making a sound. Then you know the signal strength you need to use and doesn't require you to look anything up. I think this is a better approach, because now you have to only do this once per sound. Otherwise, if you made a large build with many calibrated sculk sensors, you'd have to record the same sounds many times, which would probably get annoying pretty quickly. Now you just do it once per sound, write down the strength level, and set all your calibrated sculk sensors to that level."
0,"Classic Etho stops uploading because he got addicted to some game. As much as I love the episodes, I wouldn't have it any other way."
0,"Speaking of Minecraft ideas; I really wish they would add a redstone component that acts like a dropper, but it dispenses items automatically, at the same rate as a hopper. If it faces a block with an inventory it dispenses items it's holding into that and if it's air, then it dispenses items into the world. Name it funnel.

I think adding such a redstone component would help a lot with lag issues that conventional hopper lines create, while also (in my mind) be a cheaper alternative. You can just create a series of funnels that face each other to get the same effect as a hopper line. Mind you hoppers will remain useful for picking up items, the funnel will just be superior at transporting items."
0,"IMHO using a farm while AFK doesn't really disincentivize better farms, since AFK time is time you cannot use to actually play the game. And in a way, that 12 trial chamber ""roller coaster"" is an AFK farm, too. Maybe not infinite AFK, but you sit in the cart and then wait 6-7 minutes until you reach the end, then you drink the ominous bottle and go back for another 6-7 minutes of not having to interact with the game.
To make your waiting time worth it, you chained together multiple trial chambers. Similarly, to make your AFK time worth with an auto-clicker (i.e. to not have to keep your computer running all night) one might build a more efficient mob farm, or crop farm, etc.
At least that's my way of playing - spend the time on designing farms and other contraptions, collecting the resources, and building them. I find manual resource grind to be the most annoying part of the game, and especially dislike the early game due to that."
0,The fishing obsession is so reel. (:
0,I get the no afk in the single player how do u feel about it in multiplayer like hermitcraft ?
0,"Hey Etho. S. Labrotory, do you still olay don't starve and if so whats your oldest world/how far have you gotten in boss progression? I love the game after you played the single player version ages ago and I'd love to hear about your thoughts on the latest content!"
0,etho what type of table are you using
135,"Hey Etho, just wanted to comment and say its crazy that I watched my first video of yours over 11 years ago. Your videos have helped me out way more than you can imagine and I just wanted to say thank you and I hope you're still having lots of fun making videos <3"

0,Whats wrong with a lil fishing
0,Multilayered graveyard. Thats the first thing i thought off seeing this pale biome.

0,"Okay did anybody else get ""the hockey song"" reference here? not the stomping tom song, the other hockey song?"

1,Happy to hear Etho mention no Freecam and that the world has always been pure vanilla. Large creators are getting lazy and straying from pure Vanilla for their mega projects and sadly get much more views and have great influence
1,MAYBE finish old projects

0,honk.
0,"26:05 In the vanilla skyblock mod I'm playing (CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn), bats do drop echo shards! But only when killed by a warden. It's a pretty fun mechanic, but if you're trying to help players avoid the scary stuff, I can see why you wouldn't want wardens involved. 😅 It's fine in a mostly vanilla skyblock mod though when there's literally no other way to get the echo shards, and you can control exactly where wardens and bats spawn."
0,"With an impending world tour video, would you consider including a hermit tours segment?"

I like the fact that you kept a 7 minute uncut section of the trial chambers. In today's time where everything is constantly stimulating, it felt nice to have a break. I didn't even notice until 5:30 in it."

0,i would love smaller projects!
0,We should call it comment of the month at this point
0,Did you consider streaming the fishing game? I think it would be a fun thing to watch! In the past you were online a couple of times on Twitch (no I'm not old) but never followed up on that. Any specific reason?
0,Fishing! [Insert pufferfish eating carrot sound effect here]
1,10:25 I’m having deja vu

0,JOE ITS ME!
0,Etho has seen/read Silo! Such a great series

Or I guess I should ask how often you are able to play other games as well, I’ve always been curious, I know you’ve mentioned others and of course I’ve seen you play others. For instance I feel like you would enjoy hollow knight. I personally have been playing a lot of baulders gate 3 as well as hades. Anyways just thought I’d ask.

Most of us are here for you—the gameplay is just a bonus. The main content we enjoy is you, not just the game."

0,"Thank you Etho, I needed this today"
0,For the dogs taking damage maybe if there was a way to detect if/when the take damage you would have a time-based dispenser block that is just far away from hitting the skeletons and other mobs that it dispenses a low-grade regen potion or you could have something similar but at the top where the initial drop off point for the skeletons you could have a dispenser on a time-clock that dispenses a weakening potion or something like that. It may look out of place or unnatural/janky but I think it could do the job.
0,Been a while since I've seen an Etho LP episode. Glad I clicked on this one.

0,12 different trial chambers like 12 districts in the hunger games?
0,"I think you can hold a looting sword in the main hand and explosive rockets in the off-hand. Then, you could spam rockets into the killing chambers for the looting effect on the skeles and the breezes.

0,"Oh, how missed this :D"
2,"Honestly, when I heard you talking about Bundles I thought of inventory issues, how they could fix it and that took me back to Minecraft Dungeons. They are so useless - aside from Spawners, but let's be honest you use them maybe once early and then you have a monster farm - and it's mindblowing they didn't get an overhaul with the caves update. They don't even need to go far with it, just add some unique items that you actually want to look for - and hey, there is a game that already shows what can be done: Terraria. Magic Mirror to teleport back to spawn/bed? I always install a mod just to set a single home I teleport back to. And these could include unique items you can equip that give you an effect, e.g. secondary armor slots (helmet, chest, legs, boots) where you can put in one effect. One could be more movement speed or ramping movement speed, Elytra get moved to it as well for the chest. The helmet could have interesting effects like night vision, ore tracking (nothing special, just like a 3-5 block distance that reveals Ores for you, toggled via hotkey). Legs idk, point is less to come up with ideas and more to say that these items could be in the Dungeons and you can have multiple per slot, but only 1 can be equipped. It's honestly a bit sad to think of just how old something that could be so exciting is and that they barely received an update ever."

And always loved your world and the cave system you made, however i noticed that with every 100 episodes you do a world tour and upload your world file. With consoles now keeping up on updates with PC, is there a possibility that we will see your world come to bedrock for us fans who aren’t interested or unable to go the PC route ? 

Been a fan since the OG TNT Olympics. Keep crushing it!"
0,This is the most amazing thing I have seen in my hole 12mc year life nice bro
0,It would be cool if beacons affected owned animals. Wolves + regen + skeleton farm
0,"Hey Etho! Regarding the dogs for the Trial Chamber farm, since you mentioned the Sculk Sensors in the video, maybe it would be possible to have regen potions activated by an entity damage Sculk just out of range of the skeletons. I'm not very familiar with the Sculk Sensor mechanics, but if the dogs are the only entities within range then that seems like a potential way of doing automatic healing."
0,I like the sound of smaller projects! Seems like fun! Congrats on almost 600 episodes.
0,"Ep. 600 means tidying up and finishing projects, very exciting!"
1,"I'm straight, but Etho is so darn cute ❤️"
1,"I am actually looking forward to smaller projects and a few new unfinished projects. I like the most the clever ideas. For example mastermind.

0,"Comment of the Day submission: Etho, have you seen AboutOliver’s blind play through of Minecraft? It’s a fascinating case study of seeing someone work naturally through the game’s progression without any outside input. Do you have any thoughts about the game’s progression now compared to how when you first were figuring things out and what you might change?"
1,"I’m not going to lie, this EP episode was a bit disappointing. I understand the juggling of the monotone building vs keeping attention, but I do miss the videos from years ago showing how you work things out. This episode felt more of like “here’s a recap of what I’ve done + 10 min of pale garden stuff” which I’m not a fan of. Not that you’d ever be equivalent to this, but it seems a lot like the Minecraft content that is churned out today that never shows the process, just the outcome. 


Not meant to hate, I’ve loved you for over 10 years, but I hope you can see this feedback and see if you can incorporate more of that into your videos."

1,"long time viewer here and not just you, been watching  Bdubs, Docm77 and all the others. Last week doc streamed some of the fishing on mcc and I decided to give it a try having never played anything but vanilla. After what I thought would be half hour of play, I ended up playing 7 hours, its so much fun and I just wanted to say how impressed I am about your involvement. Love that you are posting some content on ye old youtube channel, but I hope you keep it up Etho, don't give up the fishing :)"

1,"30:50 this segment just reminds me how unintuitive the tree growing mechanics are in this game, they should really make it so that if a sapling can't grow into a tree (due to either not having enough space, or not having enough saplings if it's dark/pale oak) you don't waste bone meal on it"

0,"Hey Mr. Fisherman, I would love some episodes of you just going around your world doing random odds and ends!"
0,"two things.
1: totally agree with that reasoning behind your no afk philosophy, personally i don't really play survival because of how many ways it doesn't really engage me? doesn't hook me in as much as other games like minecraft (also setting up a server is annoying unlike terraria or core keeper or whatever) so i just play creative... but i totally understand not wanting to take the easy way out- But personally, i've tried playing a half/half survival and creative type thing before, where i either have a timer or otherwise a Limit on how much i can do with creative (like sacrificing a diamond block for command blocks, stuff like that) and that Really helps with just how Grindy minecraft can be, sure most players are used to the grind but when everyone's mining trips are measured in *hours* that's not exactly indicative of the Casual players's experiences... and i think that makes it so about half of those billions of sales of minecraft just go unplayed because ""i don't want to have to strip mine or go caving for 8 hours to get items i'm not even guaranteed to keep"" is seemingly an uncommon sentiment among the online minecraft community? i really don't understand why not but apparently people would rather come home from their jobs and work a second smaller digital job in order to get good stuff rather than it being Slightly easier...

and 2 (preface: i have 11k hours in terraria. please understand that i've enjoyed all eleven thousand of those hours thouroughly, i don't have a play-time for minecraft but most of it was probably spent playing minigames on servers): i have an observation about sandbox games that has made me realize why survival minecraft struggles to keep me engaged (or lure me in in the first place), minecraft doesn't have fun.
or at least, when it has fun it's usually extremely time intensive, literally just text, or so niche most people won't ever find it naturally, such as playing music for parrots making them dance, the splash screen text, or evokers changing red sheep to blue.
minecraft doesn't have unique items that drop from enemies rarely (like the bat bat in terraria, or the mushroom cap in core keeper, or figurines in starbound), or *silly*, *whimsical* things you can stumble upon or find in chests (like in terraria how the golfer found golfing in the desert, or how you can fish up a joja cola and get a Stardrop from Purifying it- i'll get back to this), minecraft has funny languages! and text!!! but funny items? play something else i guess.
and don't even get me started on the Crossover stuff minecraft *doesn't do*, like i get that they have the marketplace on bedrock edition so they can just relegate all the crossovers to that, but Steve got in SUPER SMASH BROTHERS and there's not even a PAINTING ABOUT IT?
minecraft is owned by microsoft and there's no allusion to masterchief, there's no x box, no bethesda *Anything*, it's like minecraft has a clause in every crossover that it is *one way*- except on bedrock- they'll loan out steve sure, but putting even a *hint* of another intellectual property in the vanilla game (and not an april fools joke) is some Horrible suggestion that would lose them money or something. even though they're minecraft and even making the slimes blue and drop ""gel"" for halloween would make people cry tears of joy.
but i digress, minecraft simply has no fun- UNLIKE TERRARIA, which has a WIKI PAGE'S WORTH of crossover content, edge of space, worms 3 (in the mobile version, but still), the dungeon defenders 2 is practically INTEGRAL to the game's progression, you can get a CREEPER COSTUME- they crossed over, with a *YOYO MANUFACTURER*. they also crossed over with stardew valley, core keeper, don't starve, and there's plans for dead cells and pal world... but maybe that's just a terraria thing, maybe they're more okay with getting a little silly with it.
i think if minecraft wants to bring in new casual players, instead of making the game prettier or adding another shade of gray to be used in the world's longest gray-dient, they should get silly with it, add rare cosmetic items that drop from enemies, add rare loot that has literally no function *like the spyglass!!! do more spyglass-like things but sillier!!!*

to summarize: no-afk rule good, minecraft is insanely grindy and everyone seems to ignore this, and mojang has no fun but they Really should."

1,"I've been finding bundles very useful myself. In addition to a similar utility bundle I keep on me, it's made organizing my ender chest a lot easier. My redstone shulker box has several bundles of things I either don't use much but can help with troubleshooting or I won't ever need a full stack of for a project. Stuff like sherds and armor trims now have their own bundle rather than a dedicated shulker box. I've also been experimenting with packaging parts for redstone components like item filters, autocrafting, flying machine, etc. in bundles so I can figure out the components I need and grab the bundles for them. I wish they added a way to automatically fill bundles, though, to make things easier."

19,"I will say I think to a degree it is a game design flaw if people choose going AFK over actually playing the game. That means the fun of achieving it through game play is not fun enough to warrant the time spent. People would rather play as little of the boring parts as possible, in order to play as much of the fun parts as possible. And it may be possible to make those boring parts fun, but if that is difficult for players to do, then that too is a game design flaw. I think there should be fun and engaging alternatives to farming materials designed by the developers, rather than leaving it to the players to find out. For example, mob loot; Killing mobs out in the world will never give enough loot at a decent enough pace to not make the player get sick of it before they have enough for whatever they need it for. And as such, people turn to building mob farms. And while mob farms doesn't require you to go AFK, it isn't exactly fun standing at one either, so I think there should be a buff to looting, or dungeons should get a rework essentially function as a mob slaughter arena, where the player fights the mobs rather than watching them die in a trap. Let this be a fun alternative that yields a decent haul of mob loot.

I've actually built a mob arena myself in vanilla survival, using spawners. The main problem was there was no way to move the spawners, so I was lucky to find about 4 or 5 that were relatively close to each other. But even then, it was quite the lame arena. If it were possible to silk touch spawners, and maybe set the distance they turn on, then I would totally build a mob arena, and use that as my main way of getting mob loot. But I still think Mojang themselves should do this. And I suppose they did with the trial chambers, but those don't have nearly enough mob variety. I suppose they could do more trial chambers themed around different mobs. Like a nether one for blazes, wither skeletons, magma cubes, etc."
0,"Hey hey, how's it going good sir? 
With all the new changes and updates, is there anything from the Create mod you would like to be added to vanilla?
For example; immersive and cool  acutal working windmills, water wheels, mining drills etc.
In my opinion I don't think it would be a too far of a gap, it would incourage more interaction and get rid of some of the static and boring stuff that everyone has done a milion times.
Granted it would add to the inventory management issue, but they should also dedicate a future update with a inventory overhaul."
1,"hey etho I was wondering what some of your favorite TV shows are, what genres do you tend to lean to? Your viewers know a lot about how much you like seinfeld but I'm sure we are all curious about what else you like to watch or plan to watch.... its so hard to find new shows nowadays it feels like"
0,I’ve been re-watching your po2 series. Teaching my girls how to play modded mc. Could we get an ozone reborn series?
0,"Hey Etho, can you show us all your farms and see if they all still work?"
0,This is awesome! Thanks for showing the uncut trial chamber journey. It is absolutely epic. Loved the video!!
0,BioShock is a better theme for the trail chamber farm I think. It's a steampunk style game and it goes nice with the aesthetic of the trial chamber
1,"Night has been blessed, thank you etho missed ya ❤"
0,Etho plays Minecraft months after being addicted to fishing...
0,"Honestly with the fog effect in the Pale Forests... I think a dark evil castle/ ""Mordor"" esk fortress would fit in so amazingly especially with your Amplified world. A big tall volcano with a dark evil looking castle that's kind of broken down and patched with wood (The Hobbit Goblin City inspired dilapidation). 
I have no clue what things of use could be built under/inside the above build idea... maybe some shifty floor flower farms for the Eye Blossoms. Maybe a Resin Farm, but that isn't Biome Specific like Flowers...
Idk, to me the pale forest esthetic really feels perfect for some dark LOTR Mordor esk builds. Like Decked Out 2s Castle, don't get me wrong it looks perfect just where it was built... but imagine that build but IN a Pale Forest with the fog effect and spooky silence with custom random audio like Jevin had in his base this season during Halloween. I know you stay pure vanilla but just imagine it all coming together to create a really dark, evil and super scary looking and feeling build/biome to explore and show off."

9,"For the skele farming portions of the trial chambers farm, to ensure the dog's never die... armor + occasional Healing Potion dispensing ontop them. 
Remember tamed dogs in a minecart can still attack 1 block around themselves AND won't teleport away so untamed wolves aren't necessary."

0,I'd love to see something more colorful in the pale oak forest. With oranges and purple maybe.
2,"I vote yes, honestly the idea of ""vaults/silos/bunkers"" being tied together via a rail line with each focusing on different things like your described sounds awesome! It sure would be a TON of work but in the end the would go a long way towards making the ""farm"" fit I. The world with some lore to back it up. Nothing is worse than amazing builds that look like crap and don't really ""fit"" in the world."
0,i forgot and love the f-zero music.  i loved that game so much lol.
1,can't believe the library still isn't finished 😆
0,He's back from the fiahing war! Congrats on getting first in mcci fishing :D

0,I KNEW YESTERDAY WHEN HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TO WORK HE WAS GONNA RELEASED A VIDEO I KNEW
0,"I can't say that I agree about afk farms being like using creative mode.  If  I put in the work to build a contraption, move a bunch of sheep in, and then can get wool out of the chests, I still had to invest time into getting that one resource set up.  Just because I'm not walking in with shears and clipping every wool off a sheep doesn't mean it is anything like creative.  It just means that there is no longer a need to worry about that single resource while going and dealing with other stuff.
You don't seem to have any problem with trading for resources.  How is that any different?  If you buy a bunch of redstone dust, that's not really any different.  Stop using villagers and go mine your redstone!  There's just... There's no need to gatekeep what is acceptable gameplay or to naysay farms.  It isn't at all like creative mode to spend a few hours setting up a farm for a resource.  And, while you are right that a fully afk farm doesn't require efficiency, that's a good thing.  That means you can *decorate* without worrying about loss of efficiency.  Or change the shape to fit it in an unusual space.  Or just do it yourself without any help *because you can.*  You're arguing against that in favor of... what?  Following the most efficient farm tutorial on YT?  Because it sure sounds like that's what you just said.  That improving efficiency of farms is the only goal.
Well, guess what.  There are only a few people even *capable* of improving the efficiency of many of the farms out there, anymore.  They've been pushed to extremes, after this many years, and there aren't actually many people who can do *anything* to improve them.  But you know what I could do that ilmango can't?  Build it my way, in my world, where I want it, and screw efficiency."
1,"The bonemealing is actually something I really dislike about Minecraft game design. It gives you the green particles and happily consumes your item, even when it has no effect. Really poor choice with an RNG based mechanic like growing crops. Especially for players who just gather bones regularly and don't have crazy farms."
165,"The world might be turning crazy, but as long as Etho is still posting videos, everything is still all right."
0,WOOOOOOO ETHO BACK
0,"Huh, not sure about Bats dropping echo shards, but I like your idea for skulk sensors. I mean, they could add another sensor (maybe something with ""echo"" in the name, crafted with an echo shard?) that does precisely that: it records a specific sound when powered from one side or with a specific powerlevel and outputs power on another side / pwerlevel when it hears that sound."
2,"I had not seen any of that new stuff, you are really the only MC guy I watch anymore and I don't really keep up with it."
0,You should make a cannon that can hold thousands of arrows and shoot them all at once. Seems like a good use for all the extra arrows...
0,"Hi Etho, do you think 3rd person mode should get revamped?  It’s annoying to use.  Maybe shift the view up?"
0,I’m honestly so confused on the new parts of the game. I don’t play anymore and don’t keep up other than watching ethos vids.
0,Silo is amazing!
0,Hi etho
2,"Etho, if you want to go above and beyond decorating the Trial Chamber Express, I'd love to see that! The themes sound so cool, and it'd be interesting working with the odd shapes created from the trial chambers, the spawner portals, and how the minecart track weaves through it all! Just know that Notch will have developed, released, and moved on from a spiritual successor to Minecraft before you finish it."
14,Love the trial chambers silos decoration idea. But it sounds like it would be a humungous amount of work and would become an ever-lasting project. XD

1,"Yayy Etho! Happy you're having so much fun with fishing (me too, haha. Was gonna say on the cusp of Barren and it's taking forever but literally just leveled up with a garg legendary, woo!)---but I sure have missed your videos! (Too bad fishing wouldn't make very engaging content... unless... Fishing champ strats rundown maybe? Heh).

The trial chamber ... uh, conglomerate? is really cool, and the idea about telling a story with it is great, too. Would be another large project but something that would nicely split up into smaller parts for more digestible content. Also agree about the calibrated sensor, programming by the player would have been super cool... the book's a nice solution to having to keep the wiki handy, though.

Would love to see what you might come up with as far as using the Creaking in unconventional ways. Mumbo had an idea using it as a player detector awhile back which was pretty cool, and reminded me of that one you built so long ago I can't remember how it worked, haha."

2,"For the trial chamber mob holders in the nether, I think a fun throw back would be to wrap them in iron bars like a lot of the Mindcrack S3 farms were to protect from ghasts. (also saves a lot of time on not needing an elaborate design!)"

4,Etho I agree with you on the AFKing at a farm with one exception: when you build the farm so huge that you only need to AFK for like 10 minutes
22,"for the idea at 8:50, i think the idea is fantastic, it would especially be even better if you can craft related farms that activate as you drive by so you can get multiple different resources out of one farm. It becomes decorative and functional."

11,"Thanks for the years of creation man! It's wild how much work goes into this world off camera. When I play my own world on survival, you'll slowly realize how insane some of these projects are.

0,"Hey Etho, I've been rewatching a lot of your old Modded series like SkyFactory and Project Ozone lately, and I've been wondering, will we ever get the return of the Modded Minecraft? I know putting the modpacks together is a lot of work, but there are a lot of great modpacks on CurseForge I'm sure you would love! (CrazyCraft and ATM9 To The Sky are my current favorites) Most of them also have great quest systems with really good in-game explanations and tutorials, so I think a multiplayer series maybe with Team Canada or the Hermits could also be really fun!
Just curious, because you seemed really excited about your latest modpack, which ended up breaking (i think).
Either way, I love your videos, keep up the amazing works! <3"

0,"good one etho, i have played with portals in the past and making all of that work must have been quite the chore, apart from the linking issues, im sure that you had some of them, not because you dont know how to link but because it simply had to happen just by the volume of portals. i know you want the bones but honestly i dont know if i would bother with the wolves for that on the other hand, specially if you have to build several wolf chambers. if you could somehow funnel all the mobs into a central chamber like to pretend to do with brezzes... but there are simply too many of them to simply use minecarts for that i think.

apart from that, and since you are apparently the expert fisher of minecraft, in honor of the minecraft idea of the day segment, how would you make vanilla fishing interesting? any ideas you want to share?"
0,"Etho, you have spoken in the past about wanting a way for entities to interact with the world to make it feel alive. Does the armorstand plugin on hermitcraft satisfy that need? I've always wondered how Mojang could incorporate something like that while still feeling ""vanilla"""
0,"Hey Etho! I was wondering: saying as you've got one of longest single player series for minecraft (if not the longest), have you considered doing something like a ""throw back"" question at the end of your episode? One question could be from a book you've answered before, the other a new comment. I feel like it would give you a good reason to go back to the library and finish it, use it, etc. It would also give some new comers, as well as long time viewers, a chance to hear your thoughts on something that you might have answered years ago--so wouldnt necessarily pick again! (Especially if your answer has changed over time) thanks for all the hard work over the years"

I would love to see more smaller projects in episodes, I love the larger projects, but they are very time consuming which I can imagine takes a lot of IRL time. Maybe a few smaller projects will allow for more videos (which I personally wouldn’t mind!)

7,A cool idea for that amplified pale garden is to make a small abandoned town. The factory would be the cause of it and on one of the hills could be the factory owner's mansion. You could plant creakings around the place to simulate the horrible effects it had on the citizens.

0,"Honestly so happy with this direction, I absolutely adore every cozy decoration, finishing-touches and polish episode so much!

I just wanted to leave a comment early to hopefully catch your attention and tell you, you mean a lot to me man. I've been watching you for what feels like most of my life and you always cheer me up. Thank you for doing what you do brother, you have no idea how much you've helped me ❤"
0,"Women want him, fish fear him"
49,Guys dad's back with the milk- I mean fish
1,Bro finally returned from bass pro
2,I know this is unrelated to the video but you really need to play Terraria when the new update comes out. I don't know if you played 1.4 but just didnt record it but 1.4.5 will be coming out some time in the next few months and it would be really awesome to see you and Zisteau get back on that
1,A pack of breeze is called a gust
1,600 idea: take B-dubs on a tour of the world :)
0,"Love the Silo idea, the mystery to it all is just so captivating!"

1,It’s been a blast watching you on that leaderboard this last month! You and Scar managed to reel me in to fishing and now I’m hooked 🎣. So cool to see this whole trial chamber/nether set up 🤩.
0,"hey etho
been loving the videos for years now 

maybe you are interested in learning some movement tech

ever since you could swap armor by right clicking it i learned to switch my elytra mid flight to my chestplate that i always hold on my hotbar 

its a lot of fun 
you keep the momentum but stop flying

hope youll try it 
have a good rest of your day"
0,YAY EPISODE!!! congrats on #1 on the leaderboard etho!!!
0,Etho watched Silo. That's pretty cooool.
0,tuis was greatttttt
0,id watch etho fish for hours think of the stories he'd have to tell
1,Every time there's a long gap between videos I'm afraid Etho just retired and told nobody
6,remember when a project was practically just turning on and off water flow from a certain chocolate colored mob farm. simpler times. oh how things have changed.
0,"Loving the let’s play videos lately so jam packed with all sorts of content
Just wondering have you ever considered playing vintage story? It’s very similar to terrafirmacraft."
1,And now I am hooked on fishing. Thank you Etho. :) I saw him people.
0,is there a reason why you dont build a TNT looting farm (and use wolves instead)?
1,"Silo is such a good show, etho check out severance and sunny"
5,"Oh wow, I came up with the exact same utility bundle but with two fewer items lol. Great addition to the game."
0,Is there another mob the skeletons will target that you can use to draw the skeleton's attention before they reach the dogs?
0,welcome back buddy!
0,ETHOOOOOOO
89,"using the Library to streamline your time on other playthrus is such a Genius Etho move, and just thematically makes the Library so much more interesting

it's also a very Bdubs method of ""maximizing your enjoyment in-game"" because sure you could do the same thing with notepad but that's boring!"
0,"What a wonderful birthday present lol, Etho has returned from beating Minecraft Fishing
Thanks for the upload Etho, looking forward to your future projects!"
0,We still haven’t forgotten about how you betrayed your good friend iskal
1,"I actually had a dream last night that etho posted his last video and retired, was genuinely sad this morning lol"

9,Over years of watching Minecraft videos my brain has been trained to expect a cut in the video whenever you go through a portal so it seriously fucked with my head as you jumped from rail to rail and portal to portal near instantly. 😂
0,First ladder's vid in the year! As soon as I'm off work imma get my snacks and happily watch it
0,YEAHHHHHHHH ETHO ETHO ETHO ETHO ETHO ETHO ETHO

0,Hawk 22:16
0,its been 84 years
0,Very cool roller coaster ride
0,Love the fallout inspired tunnels idea!!
0,12 trial chambers/districts? Is this how Panem was created? It was Etho all along?
1,How would you feel if for ep 600 world tour you made a back up then got some friends onto a server version to show around?
0,That intro has been here for so long
2,"Hey Ergo! I was playing terraria recently and thought of your series you had with Zisteau. It had me thinking of two things, if the team canada series for starblight desert from your perspective would ever be uploaded, and if you would do another playthrough of Terraria or similar games again. I think you would enjoy playing games like factorio, oxygen not included, and satisfactory! Thank you for being my favourite youtuber for over 10 years!"
0,HE LIVES
0,Etho!! ❤❤
6,Etho having a book full of calibrated sculk sensor power levels is such an old head thing to do.
0,"That farm is a ""go get a cup of coffee"" kind of farm, my goodness.  Imagine what it would be like with the faster minecart speed!"
1322,"I know this isn't probably something you'd be up for but honestly a ""just chatting"" type of video where you just talk through stuff (commonly-asked questions, thoughts on future LP projects, Hermitcraft, general YouTube things) while zipping through the trial chambers would be, at least to me, so fun. Getting to hear your thought process in general is always something I personally enjoy, and the visuals of you on your lil roller coaster-esque ride through these chambers is so so relaxing~

Great to have you back Etho! Congratulations on absolutely killing it in MCCI Fishing! 🎣"
0,The villager trader hall is so pretty
0,How many rails did you use for the 12 trial chambers ?
0,"Etho, do you watch any anime?"
