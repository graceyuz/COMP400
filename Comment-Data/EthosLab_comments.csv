1,King of the ladder was always my favorite episode of MindCrack. Such a good throwback mentioning that lmao
2,"I went through literally every perspective, and while there were six people at the bottom of the tower, only Pearl happened to catch the point at which the tower fell... but was too far away to see what happened. Everyone else was either turned away or looking at the top of the tower, so there were no witnesses for Etho's alibi. The tunnel definitely makes it seem like he didn't pull the trigger... but he IS the one who built the tower. Pearl did technically see Grian's name underground for just a second, though.

They could've created plausible deniability by setting off TNT to make it seem like a Creeper blew up the bottom of the tower... they wouldn't even need to break the sand, would they? A torch being under the sand will always be suspicious, but if the would tower just drops a couple blocks, all of the ladders will still pop off, right? They could've gotten away with very little suspicion"

0,After watching cleos video and actually seeing she was behind everyone when the tower fell I realized something you could literally see where every one was on the tower by the order that they died because Big b and skizz were on top and tango had just knocked off big b when they tower fell cleos was the first one that died meaning she was in last place at the time and big b than tango than skizz died meaning not only was skizz first to the top he was still there when the Tower fell meaning Cleo played you and you owe him some diamonds lol

1,I think even if the tower wasn't dropped there would've been at least two kills anyway if you gave them a couple minutes lmao (I really wanted to see them play king of the ladder)
7,"Hindsight is 20/20, but I wonder how much better Etho's involvement could have been concealed if he had acted more upset and less willing to give up on his own game once ""someone else turned it into a trap,"" and rebuilt it out of dirt or something out of a lake so that the game could be played (""safely this time, since apparently you can't include any risk without getting exploited!"") for the diamond block."
0,"I appreciate BDubs calling out all of the dark greens for being pansies when they aren't willing to take a risk for a thing that would be fun and make their episodes more entertaining. Even despite the fact that it does turn out that the thing was rigged against them, the man understands improv and the fact that the people who are doing the best have very little actual excuse not to ""Yes, and"" to a good setup when the cost for things going badly is just losing a fraction of their lead!
Paranoia makes for good television to a point, but so does engaging with games, as does an 8-player multi-kill."

0,"Martyn saying 'That's the greatest thing I've ever seen' RIGHT after the pillar finishes collapsing completely and there's a beat of silence is perfect comedic timing

Also if Etho wanted to know who was actually at the top at the time of collapse, he could have seen whose death message came up last (Skizz) since they would have had the longest to fall"

0,No way. Ladders is back.
0,"They call him ladders:  They go up, and they come down...but they don't go back up again."
0,"My plan for the society would have been using the Dragon. 
Get the whole server in on the idea of slaying the dragon.
Bring a bunch of beds, get everyone to sleep on whatever beds they like. 
Mentally keep track of a few. 
Once everyone jumps in, one of US accidentally dies while the other two just stay alive while pretending to fight. 
The one who died wakes up, breaks all but a few beds and fills the room with lava. 
The few who used those beds will wake up and Burn! Hopfully, they'll put in chat after they die that they need someone to bring water. 
Then ANYONE can help them. 

Your plausible deniability is to put in chat, ""I'm at SPAWN??"" after you die the first time. 
When you break beds, most other people who die or succeed will also wake at spawn. 
Those who do fall prey will blame the last person who went in, Not the first person who died and two unknown helpers. And the achievement tracker will be their ""Evidence""


But for the plan you did, a secret network of tunnels connecting everyone's baces would have masked who was responsible."

0,"I'm not sure you got away with it. Bdubs had the right idea, without even knowing it. The Society could have planted the idea in the cabin boys' heads and had them pull it off. It would still be your word against theirs, and if they deny it, you can present proof that they were involved. As they cannot prove you were involved, it would be a case of 'he said, she said.' However, the Willies have their reputation to fall back on, claiming it is Bdubs framing them to get back at you."

0,He truly is Etho ‚ÄúLadders‚Äù Slab
3,I love Etho genuinely trying to tell Bdubs not to come to school tomorroww.
0,"2 vs 6 is for the greater good... 
They take 8 üòÇ"
0,Improv club is my absolute favourite bit of this new series
2,"I've been going around watching everyone's perspective, it's glorious. The people on the ladder. The spectators watching UP the ladder. The rare spectator who got to see the whole fall. The knowing perp who was trying not to die of laughter below. And of course, poor Scar, who was stuck in the mines (which made it 1000% funnier, same energy as that one UHC where I believe you, Doc and Bdubs were in a team and two of you were on a pee break when the dragon was killed, leaving poor Bdubs to do a narration).

And I love how the multi-kill was a true team effort. Etho setting it up. Grian activating the trap. Gem reigning in the suspicion as the innocent witness. It was a work of art.

That, and I never expected King of the Ladder to turn into Among Us. That was so much fun <3"
1,Im so glad etho got to be part of this. I dont think anything would have beat his king of the ladders idea. He made this episode. This is shaping up to be one of my favourite life series
0,Ladders strikes once again.
1,"Best series, I could watch this every day!"
0,"Etho got Ladders on the Brain, what a ‚ÄúW‚Äù"
0,How did Cleo manage to lie her to the diamond block when she was the furthest from the top? üòÜ
0,"Talk about leading people down the garden path. 
I think the game has no way to end but the way it did. It went completely over everyone‚Äôs head. Hilarious."
1,So fucking good
0,"I was actually surprised when I found out via Grian in this episode that only he was hard-coded into the society. When I saw Grian's thumbnail and Etho's episode title after watching Scott's episode 1st this week I was like, smart of Grian to choose Gem and Etho for this - 'sgonna make it actually work! I'm almost sus on Grian about only himself being hard coded but an choosing, like Scott to Etho in a way, to believe Grian."
1,Bdubs' story in the first 2 minutes I such a wild thing to say on camera. You couldn't torture that out of me
0,"Hey etho, Is it possible to pm? I have an inquiry I would like to pass by you :)"
1,"A lot of shows these days tend to use nostalgia as a cheap excuse for unoriginality. But Etho? Disguising the ultimate Mindcrack callback as a hidden weapon with layers upon layers of social deception? He‚Äôs garnered the server‚Äôs trust by mentoring everyone about old Minecraft, only to plot the biggest kill in the life series with his signature flair‚Äîladders and minigames. We‚Äôre truly reliving Etho‚Äôs past life, yet with the novelty and brilliance of the present. As someone who frequently rewatches the classics, this series is gold. Thank you for the memories. ‚ô•Ô∏é"
0,I love Scar trying to pronounce serendipitous and Etho confidently correcting him to Scranpulous
0,The order of deaths would be the order of heights on the ladder pole. Made it very easy to rank them and cleo was one of the lowest lol
0,Etho has been such a menace this series lol!
0,46:30 amazing foreshadowing from jimmy
0,ETHO YOU AMAZING LMAO I laugh my heart out. Did not expect it to work that well.
0,"perhaps shart problems shouldn't be discussed in the problematically warm, hot tub water..."
0,34:00 BDubbs refers to etho as his wife.
1,"For this series my favourite to watch is Etho. He's so into the little things in every update.
I learn Minecraft trivia from this :)"
3,"""You hear one sound and all of a sudden you're pure panic, it's embarrassing"" I love bdubs so much lmaoo"
0,26:58 made me wheeze. just the tops of grians eyes looking out. it's so cute XD
0,"HA so I watched Scar first, and had no idea what this week's ""bit"" was! I love the different perspectives"
1,1:01:32 Are the tub boys in their revenge-cheating era?
12,"28:20 Screw the King of the Ladder thing, this was a well timed Ghast and I know need new underwear after Etho jumped around Gem."
1,everyone blaming etho
0,Sworn to secrecy
0,Definitely my fave pov this week üòÇ
1,"Of you're not gonna do custom thumbnails, at least select a frame where you're with your associates. =P"
0,This is seriously one of the best Life episodes ever! The chaos is next level xD
0,"there was a version, where you could get multiple types of protection on a single piece of armor. That would be cool to take advantage of :D"
0,I love that Etho finally got a big group kill and it was using king of the ladder of all things
0,Think it‚Äôs mad that so many of the older Minecraft players have no idea what king of the ladder is
0,No-one can ever call Etho washed up again after and idea and kill this epic.
0,Who needs to create a thumbnail when the perfect shot is in the episode?
0,"18:40 
Joel:  are you going to the fortress?
*awkward silence*
Joel: sure I'll come.."
0,‚ÄúGrian‚Äôs like the lost sock that got stuck in the machine.‚Äù
2,Crazy that the episode opened with bdubs telling everyone he pooped his pants is wild.
0,"Dang, the way everyone got actually a little upset from that is wild lol. I guess knowing after the fact will make it better?"
5,Starting the episode with bdubs shitting his pants is wild
0,hell yeah
1,Why is nobody blaming Etho the infamous troll?
1,This is quite possibly the greatest episode of the Life Series ever.
1,Old combat is still superior
5,"Found Etho during hermitcraft S7. Watched a fair few old episodes, including the original King of the Ladders (which was fantastic!).

I can not imagine a better way this could have unfolded ... Absolutely brilliant idea and execution ... Added to my favourites and watched lots of viewpoints from others. 11/10."
0,Yes! Go team EGG! Etho you are forever the king of the ladder.
0,"I would love to see more Etho, Joel, Grian, and Gem doing stuff together and teaming up! The chemistry is so good, fun, and natural!"
0,"I came for the king of the ladder pov, but this guy is real villain

1:11:04 literally using abusive relationship tactics"
0,wouldn't the order they died in be the correct height order reversed?  Cleo lowest -> Skizz highest?
2,The soft voice crack on ‚Äúdefinitely not 8 people‚Äù was so funny
0,Please build Etho's bottomless pit
20,Bdubs and Etho constantly arguing in life series will never be old
1,"king, you are so winning this"
0,etho saying he had 8 diamonds instead of 9 to account for the friendship one was sweet
0,"the hot tub crew is giving ""first time someone dates outside the established polycule"" vibes this episode and i'm here for it"
0,Unfortunately it‚Äôs not ginger
9,"Outside the ladders-based shenanigans, I fell that the conversation around the boats at 12:08 is hidden gem. The idea that the map makers/ devs came to a point where they had to move boats stuck in walls across minecraft versions to keep the bit going just because Etho didn't want to tell anyone how to get rid of them is hilarious. They got rid of a desert, but the boats had to stay. That's dedication"
6,"""He goes up... and you go down."" (eerie music)
LADDERS: COMING TO THEATERS THIS FALL"
1,51:03 cleo gets the block for being the only person not yelling üòÇ
0,"The Secret Society Prevails!

Rooting for your win Etho!!! Etho wins this time!"
0,Noticed after the thumbnail thing being pointed out last time. Everyone in this thumbnail died to the society.
3,"I did not think that I would be watching Ethoslab this long. I remember watching the ""king of the ladder"" episode of Mindcrack 13 years ago"
0,This episode was amazing!
0,amazing video etho!
0,Honestly the best episode of all the Life series ‚ù§
0,"47:25 Cleo being top of the list is such karma as this legend gets written into the ancient tombs. Not washed up now! haha
... Also is this list reverse order for who made it to the top?
... Also also, love ya Cleo, but Etho ma boi"
0,YESSSSS ETHO DID KOTL
0,Glad she's feeling better but this episode would be even more hilarious if Gem still has the voice crack!
0,"1:12:22 that‚Äôs truly one of the noises of all time, you ok there buddy?"
4,"The menacing Ladders has come back, he can go up and he decides when everybody goes down."
19,"Etho showing us all our age when asking ""Do you know KotL?"""
9,I really hope Etho wins this one! It would make so much sense that the OG wins PASTLife!
25,Ladders. He goes up and everyone else goes down
4,"24:55 ""have any of you heard of King of the Ladder?""

So much nostalgia just hit me from that, and funnily enough that whole game idea was started by etho, guude, baj, and pause when they pranked guude's house back on mindcrack"
1,"This episode was pure cinema.  Love the King of the Ladders throwback, I feel old"
0,Let's Go Ladders
4,heyyyyy it‚Äôs duck life!
1,Etho is so much worse at lying than Gem and Grian üò≠
0,"And that, my friends, is why they call Etho ladders"
0,petition for Etho to join the villeys!
2,"i love bdubs, but i was not expecting that story when i decided to watch an etho pov while i eat my lunch"
0,i can't wait for next episode to see everyone's reaction to the plot
0,It would be even better if Etho got a different person outside the society to host his game haha
0,we went from 6 lives > 2 to 8 lives > 6
0,Ladders...you go up...they go down
0,"That end‚Ä¶ The family lives! 
Etho just left Cleo for Scott. It‚Äôs so clear now, and really funny. Unplanned perfection."
0,What a week for E to the T to your mom üòÇ
0,what update did the wither come out? :)
0,"I watched Cleo's video first and Gem was talking about a duck pond and I was very confused, All makes sense now"
0,"I hope someone makes fanart of that dodge at 28:19, etho and gem are üêê"
1,This was the best kill since Bdubs' boogie in Last Life
3,"I love how Etho acts like just a goofy guy, but is secretly like the *smartest* person on the server (though Scott easily has the best street smarts and common sense). The way he was able to bait people with nostalgia, covertly participate then find an excuse to dip out, deflect blame away from himself and grian, and even build repertoire with Cleo without angering anyone else is absolutely genius."
0,ladders my goat
2,"""Take a chill pill"" we truly are back in beta now, boys."
2,eyyyy ladders!
1,I want this to be Ethos season so bad for the win!
224,"I love how NOBODY was suspicious at first that the pillar was made of sand, prebuilt on top of a platform, and there was no water pit below, even with players acting strange and an unexplained noise at the start of the episode. Etho's biggest advantage is that people have started to dangerously underestimate him."
1,Why are there no Etho pins on the merch store?
5,A master stroke of nostalgia from Etho at his prime
1,1:08:48 we're not even improv in!!!!
7,AND he gave his ex wife the diamonds. What a G.
2,"Of _course_ Etho's idea was to get the kills with ladders

They've all been Etho'd by Ladders himself!"
2,"Today I had to move out of my apartment and into a new one with no help. I told myself that once I was moved, I would allow myself to enjoy this. It is time."
98,"As someone on Gem‚Äôs video said,

E- Etho
G- Grain

0,"This is the most iconic and memorable hermit moment in years imo, it being Ethos plan makes it even better too"
3,1:12:18 new etho sound just dropped
0,This honest to god might be the best episode in life series history. A literal movie here. Absolute cinema great work Etho this is going to live rent free in my head for months to come
0,"HE GOES UP, HE GOES DOWN"

0,Wow what an episode ‚ù§
1,this is the funniest smp video ive ever seen thank you
1,"The sign saying ""I know what you did"" while Etho is being given the 3rd degree by his team is hilarious!"
0,"@EthosLab you evil, freakin genius!!"
0,honestly still prefer this combat to newgen ;.;
4,"the amount of trust they (except Skizz) have in Etho is astounding. 
Etho asks them to go into a hole, they do it.
Etho asks them to climb a tower made of sand, they do it.
also Bdubs totally knew it was Etho all along. He can see through it all, and he still tried to play along to help him. What a friend.

very among us episode. 3 imposters and a bunch of crewmates. poor cabin boys got separated

I just realised this episode is over an hour long. it didn't even seem like that. xD"
2,"Etho's ladder grab/save falling off of the tower was perfect, and then the tower fell. Brilliant. :D"
3,"The saddest moment is when Smajor was asking Etho, and the defeated sound in Etho's tone was so miserable. A plus. That was peak comedy!"
0,The EGG Society
1,"I guess you guys made sure kill 2 ppl for each one of you and another extra 2 to be sure xD Cabin Boys better be bonding next session lol or Bdubs will go insane again.

I double tap w... why i cry jumping from opened trapdoors in parkour dojo _snorts_"
10,"The legendary square hole kills 5 people and solidifies its spot in Life Series history.

Etho‚Äôs ladders: hold my beer!"
1,That was top tier entertainment. Not just the trap but Al your interactions üòÇ
1,of course ladders came up with getting an octo-kill with ladders
2,He's too powerful in earlier versions!
2,"I love how they sort of have teams formed between teams
Like the secret society and improv class :3"
0,This episode is so good. Love the whole thing beginning to end.
0,"yknow I like to eat dinner while watching your videos, but i think that might have been a bad idea with this intro"
1,"Are we all gonna forget our boy man dude Etho slayed the ender dragon? He really is having all the fun without the Cabin pals. I love the Life Series so much, this is always great to watch."
0,1:14:00 and rohan will answer
6,17:40 etho casually robbing the villies
5,13:20 i think etho got the idea of king of the ladders from skizz trying to climb the stairs
9,"Normally it's so nice how Etho's so wholesome and honourable all the time, but it kind of backfires when he has to lie üòÇ"
12,‚ÄúI gotta protect my boy Bdubs‚Äù what a ride or die friendship
0,This is trending in gaming!! Congratulations Etho! Sooo deserved!!
1,"I'm very happy you and Gem are in the same team, could not ask for the better team! The chemistry in between you two is so perfect!!"
10,"i like how etho tried to protect bdubs by telling him not to play the king of the ladder game, and then when he asks at 45:20 bdubs instantly goes ""I'M IN"" üò≠"
0,28:21
3,the secret society was AMAZING and that octokill was the GREATEST MOMENT OF THE WHOLE LIFE SERIES OMGGG the conflict between the cabin boys broke my heart a little bit tho </3
1,I'm starting to wonder if the reason they call him ladders is because he goes up and down...
2,‚ÄúBoy everyone is so roiled up today.‚Äù I love you Etho
1,"Fully random, but couldn't have picked a better trio."
0,I really want to see they play King of Ladder. It was so fun Back then
0,ten years in and etho still calls the dragon a he
0,oh we are so getting an etho win this season. that octokill was CRAZY and i am lowkey shaking???
0,I like how etho falls down so that he's safe from the whole trap and the etho of back then is so goated nice job society üòÇ
0,"Truly a thing of beauty, a work of art even."
1,Etho rushing Joel as he panics to finish the bridge üòÇ
1,If there's another king of the ladder the one at the top after a time limit should win I think.
0,Watching in 420p for that authentic iPod experience

0,"I watched bdubs' perspective first. The second I saw the ladder pillar was made of sand, I knew something was very, very wrong."
0,Bdubs got it spot on
0,anyone notice that anytime deaths happen etho is always looking away
46,The way BDubs just knows Etho and calls him out right away 55:25 58:30 1:01:30 just shows the level of friendship ‚ù§
0,Awh man. I remember way back when Mindcrack was a big thing and king of the ladder was like the funniest thing you could find on YouTube. I used to watch VintageBeef and Etho and Iskall religiously back then. Im sure those videos don't hold up to this day but it was my lifeblood when i was like 12.
3,"Between this and Guude uploading new Minecraft episodes, this feels like 10 years ago.  The nostalgia is hitting hard!"
0,"oh man the knock back enchant was crazy in this version tho, you could get like lvl 9 couldnt you?"
0,The success of that kill truly all hinged on bdubs‚Äô absolute faith in etho and all-in mentality on the ladder game ü•≤
1,You definitely got caught  they knew it was you and grian and suspect gem
0,"Secret society was so good, even before the octokill"
0,the intros and outros are for some reason reminding me of the spongebob ‚Äúfuturrrreee‚Äù episode
0,Uncle Scott? oh no
18,"This is honestly the greatest video I have ever seen on YouTube!! The bickering between bdubs and etho was just perfect and the fact that etho thought of king of the hill! I just had a smile on my face for a whole hour thinking of mindcrack and the classic pranks and games that went on that server like the original king of hill, it just makes me want doc and beef to play along in the life series too. But 10/10 video makes me want to go back and watch all of ethos old content that I haven‚Äôt seen in like 11 years, like Painting prank on Nebris by TEAM CANADA!!üá®üá¶"
2,Bdubs and Etho have a MOMENT after the pyramid situation and Cleo is the back just swiping wheat ü§£üòÇ
0,do they not see eachothers videos? I imagine that they could know since all of their thumbnails show the secret society.  or even like fan made edits or animations
8,Listening to Etho trying to find a nonchalant way to say duck was hilarious üòÇ
0,"Hey Etho! If you read these, thanks for making videos. ‚ù§"
0,Thanks bdubs for the mental picture... while I'm eating dinner. üòÇ 1:44
0,I think we should see more of Team EGG in the future. Not sure how though.

0,"Nobody thought it was weird for etho to come over with an ""old nostalgic game"" its on brandüòÇüòÇ"
0,"""Do you know king of the ladders?""
thinking to myself, ""who doesn't?!"""
0,Wasn't familiar with Etho as Machiavelli XD
3,Etho and Bdubs. You do need to get a real King of the Ladder game going now. :) So they know what it really is. I cant believe folks had not heard of it before. :) Nostalgia. Edit-Just rewatched the old video. Beef was in on the first KOTL on the mushroom cloud prank so bring him in too! :) Old Farts Unite!
8,"you notice this is a lot of videos and its so funny from all the different POVs but etho saying everyone stand near the bed then directly moving away from the bed is the funniest thing ever, its not even subtle"
0,is 29:57 even a real word? I looked it up but I'm bad at spelling. Id love to seem smart by throwing that word around if it actually exists. üòÇ
1,serampulous
0,1:42 Get your snacks!
0,**M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-MONSTER KILLLLLLLLLL**
0,"Hey Etho. What a hectic episode but everyone had fun. You are so dead next week. Mushroom facts like I promised. There are certain trees that keep in contact with each other through mycelium in the ground. The world‚Äôs largest fungal body is in Oregon and is called the giant honey mushroom (Armillaria ostoyae) covers an estimated 2,384 acres. Also mushrooms like to grow next to wells due to the high amounts of moisture in the air. So I have heard. Thanks for working really hard to get out these wonderfully long episodes."
1,they call him ladders
0,30:01 I think you mean serendipitous?
0,5:41 this seems inappropriate to laugh about
0,Joel accidentally joining the secret society is so much funnier from this perspective.
0,I didn't think it was possible to beat Grian‚Äôs quad kill in limited life but an octo kill doubled the impressiveness üòÇ
19,"Etho uses the excuse that he doesn't want Scar to die to stop him from coming with him through the portal, only for Scar to be the only player still on 6 lives by the end of the session"
0,Now that everyone knows what happened next week will be crazy
0,A great way to determine who was at the top: who splatted on the ground last

Yeah, sure Bdubs, whatever you want to believe XD"
0,What a great play. Everyone fell for it.
1,Yooooo! Etho brought up his king of the ladders idea and it instantly took my back to a video of his like 8 years ago! It‚Äôs gotta be my favourite vid of his. Just hilarious!

My nostalgia is off the charts! And Guude is making videos again. This bas been a good couple weeks."
0,"At least this time, no accidental tag-along stepped off a strider into lava."
0,Time to go back to the original king of the ladders video! Then to sky shrooms i guess
0,1:14:22 Scott is the uncle that takes care of the kids in Cleo‚Äôs place since Etho is still an absent father even though it‚Äôs his turn to babysit them
0,And this is why Etho is Ladders
0,"I love the lawless land of Life Series... To be clear, I am specifically referring to you stealing iron boots from the Villies right in front of them while you're in the middle of a secret society with Grian and Gem. I know a lot else happened in this episode, but that got a good chuff out of me. Also cried laughing at you explaining to Skizz that you gave Cleo the diamond block ""out of justice"" when it sure looked like you did it out of bribery... gg, king."
1,cool
0,Love how Cleo got the diamond block but was the lowest on the tower since she died first lol
0,I really thought Etho did the multi kill until i rewatched it since i wasnt paying attention
0,"52:34 the funniest part about that is he did it underneath lmfao, maybe she will catch etho hiding it with the cobblestone"
144,"1:09:34 Everyone screaming and Etho just ""that was a fun class"" after plopping down a TNT"
1,"He goes up, and the rest of the server goes down!"

>> A small collection of ""witnesses"" are present. Each close enough to have been the killer and who's stories don't align 100%

>> Everyone just happens to be zoomed in looking at the top of the tower at the time of the deed.

>> One of the most likely culprits, Scar, is mysteriously missing. 

>> Bdubs, the jealous lover, gets caught up in the mix and immediately picks up the scent of the truth.

>> Martin, a yellow name, is innocent but the only one with the legal means to do the act.

>> Etho, The corrupt gamemaster, is in on the plan but was fiddling with the inventory and eating food at the time of the crime.

>> Gem, Another corrupt witness seemingly totally impartial, gets vouched for by an innocent.

>> Pearl, the innocent witness, gets cast into suspicion when the tunnel at the scene leads to her base."

It's a bit of a shame how the Secret Society stuff has put a bit of strain on the Cabin Boys family though... But I'm sure it'll be resolved soon enough!"

6,Etho living up to the Ladders nickname I see!
13,"I think using some tnt to take out the ladder would've been a better play. It would've still broken all the ladders, and it could be explained by a creeper going off. But oh man, was that still funny to watch."
67,"I did not believe anybody would willingly climb a sand pillar ladder
Egg on my face witnessing an OCTOkill"
3,What a nostalgia trip
11,"If Grian had remote activated TNT to blow the bottom of the pillar up rather than breaking it normally, you could've claimed a creeper went off"
2,"honestly, the boogeyman thing should be in every single life episode and every season! i just love the game with this!!! every other ""special effects"" should just be added on top of the boodeyman :p"

1,serampulous
256,"I love how the secret society is just the villains but they swapped out Pearl with Etho, somehow it feels like it went from Team Rocket in the anime to Team Rocket in the games.
Which may not sound like it's a big difference, but I'm comparing a trio of goofy comic relief villains to the pokemon equivalent to the mafia.

Does this make Etho Giovanni? His allegiance with a completely different team could be an equivalent to Giovanni being a gym leader..."

0,I remember that moving glitch. Guude had to deal with it a lot. It has something to do with hitting a button while opening your inventory causes your player character to continue the action repeatedly. I think Guude kept getting stuck walking sideways or something.

1,"Etho, I've been watching you for 14 years on and off as I go through phases of Minecraft and other games, and recently I‚Äôve gotten back into it! During this time, I‚Äôve gone through elementary school, junior high, high school, and college, got married, started a career, and am now expecting a child. I have a long commute to work, so I‚Äôve been listening to the Let's Play series to pass the time. There are many other Minecraft YouTubers to watch, but there is something unique about your style that has kept me coming back. It's heartwarming, and I genuinely hope you are doing well. Thank you for the years of entertainment. Cheers!"
0,What's wrong with choosing a still from the video for the thumbnail?
48,Was not expecting the reference at 43:10 lol!! I kinda forgot Etho actually exists on the internet and isnt just block man
0,"22:47 god dang it Etho, I literally spilled my drink xD"
0,"Regarding thumbnails - I don't even look at them. Never have. YouTube thumbnails are like an Asian high street, where there's so many bright shapes and colours overwhelming your visual senses, and sometimes it works the opposite to how you intend. The exception being KatherineElizabeth, Tango, and Zedaph who have started putting coloured borders around their thumbnails which helps them stand out from the crowd. I personally only look at usernames and video titles, searching for content that catches my eye. Thumbnails don't influence my decision to watch a video as much as an eye-catching ""headline"" title."

2,"Etho- I say this with love- the boat prank is one of the most wholesome and dorkiest things I've ever seen in Minecraft/Hermitcraft, and I have not laughed so hard in ages üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§ Thank you! It's truly up there with the grey glass.  I love it so much, and if I had been playing Minecraft at that time, that would totally have been me, putting boats in people's walls and giggling like crazy üòÇ‚ù§

Also, I can see where it is kind of funny that you haven't heard of the Ghibli movies when your skin is the best character in all of Naruto, which is one of the most popular anime ever; however, as someone not from Japan, I also totally get how you could be familiar with Naruto and not Ghibli. I got my first exposure to anime *shows* from Adult Swim and streaming sites, while I got my first exposure to Ghibli *movies* from renting them where I worked at Blockbuster. There are definitely popular Japanese shows, movies, whole genres even that don't necessarily cross paths. But I would recommend the Ghibli movies in general though, the art and music are beautiful and they're usually pretty wholesome and pleasant experiences. Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Howl's Moving Castle are some of my top recommendations üòä"

3:02 well I mean I do know how to do it but you don't have to shout my name... 
4:35 No, they removed that feature. Shall we say after they added power rails. If this is beta 1.6 then it should still be in the game
9:15 no that's this interacting. Weird with the water, I'm pretty sure the two spacing ladder thing wasn't fixed until like release 1.3... though also I don't know if there's a mod adding it back or if it was actually 1.8. but it is a thing in Greg tech New horizons which is in 1.7.10
42:36 Yeah good thing"" tango"" had some water on him.

0,I like how Bdubs got murdered twice and he just didn't care
0,"Now i wanna see etho and gem team up on the next life series. Cottage core and cabin core collab.

And of course Bdubs will be there too cuz its inevitable xD"
117,50:14 etho knowing that the chests are burning and choosing not to do anything is so hilarious to me
1,Etho could end world hunger and he would still be thanked with some redstoneü§£
4,"9:22 there is still a way in beta 1.7.3 to glitch tnt to be punch able again. Rather than needing flint and steel. Infact there are a lot of new glitches and bugs that have been found in this version. Though I fear as a group you may have moved on already

29:36 there is also a way to get torches on the side of TNT

32:59 this actually is a glitch where if you open your inventory almost instantly after performing an action, You will be stuck doing that action until you open your inventory again or press the same action again."
3,"50:17. I remember one of his old UHC episodes where the thumbnail was a creeper seconds away from blowing up in his face.

Nothing even close to that happened in the video. The guarantee is a lie, and I love it."
1,A very fun episode
2,"Ah yes, the inverted doors

Used to have to build an entire circuit with a torch to keep one powered until the plate was pressed, and also ensure it was usable by both sides in case it were an iron door or just for convenience"
0,This video was absolutely hilarious!
0,Major etho lore drop in the end of the episode was unexpected

1,"""Remember this"" Etho I have 100 hours in the past few months in this version, I definitely remember"
0,I hope when they get to the version before they fixed the item stacking where if you pick up a bunch of items at once you hear a cool spammed noise for every item picked up.

1,49:19 Just the other day Impulse was talking about how you don't make thumbnails lol (It was on the podcast episode with BigB)
11,Biggest surprise of the season thus far is Etho knowing the square hole TikTok. Truly a hip and cool dude üòé
0,That was purely awesome.
6,Bread was the best food for exploring. A few stacks of wheat + a crafting table meant much more healing per inventory space. If you were pottering around your base then meat was better as you could just restock after healing.
1,"i can't remember when, i think somewhere within 1.5.7 there was a transmutation thing where you could use string instead of redstone, this was a hack that skyblockers used to make obsidian"

0,Ghibli movies are extremely depressing in like a bad and unpleasant way and I don't know why so many normal people who don't like anime like them. I haven't even seen many. I don't want to see more. Why do people have so much love for something that is laced with such sickness though?
0,Etho is always his own worst enemy in these series'
0,"39:31 not telling them you only were missing one heart was one of the most disgusting, dastardly moral lacking scumbag moves. You should teach the ""Villys"" your method of heartlessness. Team Rocket could really use it. They've got a hole. That's their evil."

3,Etho left the villains for a second and they built the simplest pitfall trap into the one pitfall trap to kill the most Lifers in all the series
18,"57:52 Tango accidentally dying and appearing in his own base, having to explain himself and then the genuine confusion of ‚Äòwhy is everyone here?‚Äô"
0,18:32  I dont think that rlly allowed cuz Joel had already killed Scott and killing him for killing Scott goes against the no green on green unless ur the boogie. Defending ur teammate is one thing but revenge is another

0,"idr what update it was, but if swamps get added in, remember the diamond trick! + 14 blocks Y off clay, dig down, get diamonds ez"
0,"Hey Etho.
It is fun watching you enjoy the older versions of Minecraft. The obsidian Redstone trick is cool. I totally forgot you can get mushrooms in the Nether. Are pots in the game yet? If so, can you put mushrooms in them and if not I wonder when that started. Mushrooms are cool, just in case you weren‚Äôt aware. üòä Maybe look into slime mold. They aren‚Äôt a plant or an animal but can work together to create the new generation of slime molds."
3,Been watching Naruto recently. Feels like BDubs is the Might Guy to Etho's Kakashi
0,"No shot, I just checked on my phone while watching this and I got recommended Etho's boat dispenser video"
0,Just remember to put boats in the minecarts

Also, I've been absolutely loving this series so far; it's been so much fun going down memory lane with old MC and seeing you and the other veteran players show off all the fun stuff that was once possible."
1,"I'm glad you tried to make a EATS road, it was nice to see it again.
I do remember that the boat loader was really difficult to get just right, but I'm fairly sure it should have been possible, maybe not on a server though?

I seem to remember the EATS road didn't really die until squid were introduced, because you couldn't guarantee a free path. 
The road still worked though, it just wasn't reliable because it ended in bonking."

I'm not sure if the family Let's play were earlier, but I remember the first types of SMPs began to appear around this point. One of the biggest being Hermitcrafts predecessor, Mindcrack."

0,"booster loops still worked in this version, they worked for a few versions after the powered rails were introduced until cart collision was changed and the cart dupe bug was fixed, it was just nerfed at one point to be a bit to be less powerful before they removed it completely further down the road.  You needed the booster to be a bit longer to push the cart faster, the longer they made contact the faster they went.  if grian hadn't run out of track at the end it would have shown the catapult effect speed gain better."

0,"I somehow called it in my head this session would be Beta 1.7.3. However, I was surprised to see the Boogeyman from Last Life come back, so now I'm thinking along with jumping between major versions each session, there's also gonna be gimmicks coming from previous Life Series.

Here's how I think the whole series will play out:

Session 1: Beta 1.2, no special gimmicks (3rd Life)
Session 2: Beta 1.7.3, Boogeymen (Last Life)
Session 3: 1.0.0 (Full Release), Soulmates (Double Life)
Session 4: 1.5 (Redstone Update), Lives replaced with Time (Limited Life)
Session 5: 1.9 (Combat Update), Secret Tasks (Secret Life)
Session 6: 1.16 (Nether Update), Wildcards (Wild Life)
Session 7: Current Version, End of Series"
0,"Etho has mentioned before that he picks his thumbnails from the episodes. Maybe not directly, but he's at several points mentioned that a shot might make for a good thumbnail, or deliberately set them up. I thought that was common knowledge."
0,"I do remember, lol. It's one of several things of yours I tried to duplicate a few versions too late. The door would be open as long as the boat was burning, it was pretty cool.

Speaking of which, X-Ray glitch has to be a thing now or soon, right?"
0,Hi Etho! Do you still like Paramore?
0,He's gonna take you back to the past... to play some sheary games that cut grass.
1,"Back in these days, modding the game was the way that you made it happen! I just think they remember pistons were added because of a piston mod that was very popular. 

And I think this was around the time that full conversion mod started showing up. Or at the very least mods that added so many things and it may as well not be the same game."
0,etho pretending not to know studio ghibli or what anime ü§£ü§£
705,I love how Tango clumsily edited Etho's thumbnail reveal out of Mumbo's footage. Etho literally toggles F1 in the middle of a video all the time to give himself a good thumbnail frame

3,"I went back and rewatched some of your old EATS road videos, and I'm pretty sure it was in alpha. I do think you can still do a channel of water with signs so the water flow pushes you forward, but it's not as fast."

(joking aside, it does take me back to those days of early minecraft and when I subscribed to your channel :D)"
0,"My 2 cents on ghibli, from someone who has seen all of their movies, and has seen *most* Disney movies, who has left behind animes because I have become tired of them;

Watch Nausica, Howl's moving castle, spirited away. These are the 3 major movies they get recognition from, I would consider it culture, regardless of how you view anime general.


My personal recommendation thought would be ""Grave of the fireflies"", but you have lost family recently and while this doesn't deal with the same age-range of loss, it can be rough. It still remains as my favorite movie from them that I will never watch again because of how real it is. It does deviate a lot from what Ghibli aspires to be, it is a hard watch whereas all the others are easy despite their deeper buried meanings, but it is the one that marked me the most.


Ghibli is akin to Disney in their aspirations in serval ways, to bring wonder to all age-ranges, but in my opinion, they succeed better in the latter age-ranges, whereas small children will be left with a lot of incomprehension that they might account to mysticism. 

I haven't watched a single anime in 4 years or so, but during the 3-4 year period where I spammed anime, as in watched full series in a day, the ones I keep in the highest esteem remain Ghibli. Yes, other studios have done great things, they still don't have the portfolio Ghibli has."

0,"Wait, it wasn't common knowledge that Etho actually chooses a frame as a thumbnail? I thought it was obvious as a random frame would most likely be a black screen or just a shot of open inventory or something. That being said, despite Etho just picking a frame, the thumbnails are actually much more clickable in comparison to other videos because counterintuitively it makes the thumbnails stand out."

2,"Hilarious episode,  the double square hole kills absolutely slayed me, but I'm pretty disappointed by the massive version jump.

I would love to see them all revisit that stuff, these nostalgia trips are bringing me back to the good days in 8th and 9th grades for me back when life was simple and before the responsibilities of adulthood. I think my first episode of ethos videos I ever watched was Ethos first episode on the mindcrack server all those years ago."
0,"Hey Etho! love your videos, I would really like to see you do return to your modded survival series!"
8,"2 things, i feel like you've talked about the thumbnail thing before
second i somewhat recall the 'shift' of thumbnails being more content relevant to the episode 'story' instead of one of 3 moments that youtube happens to pick"
1,Oh man! What a trip this series already has been. I am very much enjoying the Etho nostalgia with every version!
3,06:04 noo way that is the old minecraft panorama!
1,I LOVE seeing Etho actually have fun in Minecraft again.
1,Man‚Ä¶ ethos video before grians lol
0,you CANNOT get out
269,38:55 Etho just casually grabbing the saddle is so funny
0,Cabin boys
66,"ngl when grian said ""does this look familliar"" i thought it was the location of the ""you've been etho'd"" statue."
0,"Bdubs and Etho's bond is so stron, Bdubs died just to tp to him"
17,"etho, actively wearing a kakashi skin: ""I've seen some anime..."""
0,"I gotta say, etho, i do not remember seeing grian ascending from his mortal tethers
(Talking about the thumbnail in pair with the title)"
1,"The boats were so funny and with the lighthouse, such a great moment"
0,Ergo vid for my birthday üéÇ üéâ
4,"Etho: ""The EATS road"", oh, the memories. Love it."
0,"4:49 that‚Äôs ten years ago, if you know you know"
2,I miss these beta versions of Minecraft. They have a certain atmosphere to it that's so good.
0,Hey etho I think the collision hole trap thing was definitely still a thing in that version of minecraft. I believe since the server isn't using legacy code it doesn't quite work the same
7,"""I've seen some anime"", said the man that's been dressed as Kakashi from Naruto for the last decade"
0,"I remember the redstone to obsidian thing, i honestly thought that it was still in the game but no one used it because why would you xD"
0,I forgot you had to do redstone for a 2 pressure plate door XD
0,TO BE FAIR the ethroad was like a decade and a half ago i dont think i remember anything from then either
0,I only clicked this video because of the amazing Thumbnail.
2,Pretty sure the hole trap is still coming Etho!
74,"31:05 I've seen some anime

- Etho, who's been using Kakashi skin for over a decade lol"
0,Etho uploaded before Grain üò≠ I can‚Äôt watch anyone‚Äôs pov‚Äôs bc I want to watch grain‚Äôs first
5,56:33 reminds me of Better Off Dead lol - the paper boy that stalked the main character saying he wants his $2 lol üòÇ
0,"Seems like Etho‚Äôs ping was quite bad this session. That‚Äôs part of why he died. When you see other POVs of his death, the server thought he was way closer to the TNT when it blew up than it looks like in Etho‚Äôs POV."
83,I can‚Äôt fathom how someone can be unaware of Ghibli but know the square hole meme
1045,the boat and lighthouse joke was hilarious! and the fact they realized late made it even better :D
0,"Grian did say there were surprises so I wonder if they are not just going back in Minecraft but also the life series for each episodes gimmick

First week nothing extra
Second week Boogeyman
Third week health linked to someone else
Fourth a timer to lose a life
Fifth a secret task
Sixth an extra change to the world"
0,32:19 why are there eyes in Bdub‚Äòs boots?
0,"Hahaha Etho, you might need to update your keyboard ;) I know, I know, it's been a while"
82,"""Tango"" and Etho talking about Thumbnails while Impulse is struggling with lava in the background is amazing"
0,the end was great
0,Watching in 480p or below is the only proper way to watch this
16,"As much as folks are ribbing you for not seeing any studio Ghibli films Etho, I recommend these two movies in particular as both a good introduction to the style, and because they have AWESOME buildings that I think you'll really dig.

- Spirited Away (the one Scott was talking about, it is indeed argued to be one of the best films of all time)
- Castle in the Sky"
0,Boat 'em is back!
45,57:45 Tango spawning in here is just a tad funny a little giggle worthy I think.
0,its so crazy i remember this update when it came out
629,"Grian, Gem, Pearl: ""We're the villains!!""

Everyone else: ""Awww, okay! Whatever you want hun!""

Grian, Gem, Pearl: *kills three people in one episode*

Everyone else: ""Poor little baby Villys!"""
0,Yeeeees new ethoo vid!!
0,Algorithm smiles on me today
0,Lmao people only now realizing Etho chooses his thumbnails is hilarious
4,12:30 ah yes team canada pranking zisteau flashback
1,"Not sure when exactly but I think the 2 block hole problem is in a later version, I specifically remember it happening in mindcrack uhc 14 which is definitely after this"
108,"30:15 don't mess with me in this version
35:56 bdubs and his two nickels of respawing, angry and shouting, at places where etho happens to be in w comedic timing"
0,One update in and Etho‚Äôs already washed up
0,"Wasn‚Äôt there a version where you could get OP armour with all the protection enchants? And eventually add mending. It stays after access to it is removed, but you‚Äôd get some op gear with it."
0,I am enjoying this alot Etho
1,never saw a ghibli? i reconsider my subscription
3,"I love that blocking Cleo with cobble is still a thing, haha"
0,Guude would be proud of the boat prank
116,cant believe etho missed seeing all the times the sand pressure plate trap got activated üò≠
2,Etho said he picks the thumbnail frame a loong time ago in a video
2,The lighthouse boat crashes joke was hilarious!! üòÇ
3,"Oh my, I didn't knew the square hole tiktok. Thank you üòÇ"
61,Watching Etho boat up the lighthouse reminds me of early Mindcrack when he did the same to Guude's place. Here's to hoping we get a repeat of the mushroom canopy.
0,Okay I gotta admit I too don't remember much about EATS roads lol
104,44:14 ik this is an emotional gratitude moment but gem really sounding like Tarzan rn
1271,playing old minecraft has reawakened his troll instinct
0,Why is Mumbo Tango
1,skiped so many versions thats a shame really wanted to see you show off some more old school tricks in some later versions and have all the tech introduced slower
27,54:14 I love Etho‚Äôs laugh here üòÇ kinda reminds me of Zoro‚Äôs laugh
1,ETHO u need to watch Ghilbli
304,"""I've seen some anime""
-Guy who has singlhandedly changed what a Kakashi skin means in minecraft"
0,Prime Etho is a sight to see.
0,Didn‚Äôt scar technically get cured by killing Etho l
2,ok etho doesn't know studio ghibli but does know the freaking square hole tiktok
0,"""I've seem some anime"" says Kakashi"
3,"I am learning so much about the past... Mostly pranks, but so much nonetheless. Thanks for the episode! (I laughed quite a bit at your ""I would never hurt my friend Joel :)"" vibe followed by Joel giving you the weirdest look and backing away... He does not trust...)"
0,Etho thumbnail lore???
1,Where does the Skizz go? That's right. He goes in the square hole.
297,10:57 probably the MOST panic Etho has ever displayed
0,Ethos so out of touch he doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äôbro‚Äô is back :D
0,21:12  General Spaz gets revenge?
120,"50:40 that is like the most casual scathing self roasting comment I've ever heard lmao. If anyone else had said it, I would think it was unintentional."
386,"The sudden juxtaposition at 25:24 between the dark night, the murder, and the running convicts, to... ""boy, sugarcane grows fast :D"", was certainly something."
0,Why is Tango sounds like Mumbo?
13,"I am surprised they didn‚Äôt make a bunch of oak slabs, which don‚Äôt burn and are mined with a pickaxe in this version, and rebuild the cabin so it won‚Äôt be susceptible to fire."
0,Thank you for the episode üòÖ
0,Can‚Äôt wait to go on another nostalgia trip with Etho!
0,"Patch 1.8 Pre-release = Added sprinting.

1.5	13w05b	Stairs no longer prevent sprinting.
1.7.2 13w36a  Added ""Sprint"" button, defaulting to Left Ctrl."
0,"im wondering if one of the secondary gimmicks to this series is revisting past gimmicks, like, ep 1 was blank, no gimmick just learning old minecraft, today is the bogeyman? i could be wrong and its just only a reintroduction of the bogey and ep 1 was just a safe day"
0,"The fact Etho can't remember to build the EATS road, a thing HE invented, is hilarious"
2,"50:00 And probably just because he said that he does it he didn't actually do it for this episode, it is legit one of the semi-random ones provided by youtube"
0,Nice they are jumping multiple versions at a time.
0,"I really liked all of the shenanigans, especially the boat pranking."
3,I hope they play on the version where you can shift off of chests and fall down
94,Genuinely thought the thumbnail thing was common knowledge. It's super noticable.
0,"Etho I beg you to try some Studio Ghibli movies! Fantastic worldbuilding, animation and visual style overall. Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa for darker stories, Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle for more whimsical and weird but brighter stories."
11,"37:40 I feel the same that whenever I return to old versions out of nostalgia, I can't stand more than a few hours. There are a lot of comfort things missing we have today, but back then it was just peak entertainment. I mean way back into the past, 2009/2010. It's also the era where if you open someones world, every 25-100 blocks is a new building completely out of theme, while nowadays people build things that are more connected, which is really a unique style from that period (mostly because you didn't have a lot of ways to really blend stuff in, limited block selection in general but also a lack of experience). Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time just to experience that again"
3,You know what goes in the square hole? That‚Äôs right! The triangle :-)
1,That boat mechanic _has_ to come back. I get that boats sink when submerged. But rafts don't.
458,The whole thumbnail conversation feels illegal even if it is known
13,This series feels like an major anime flashback episode 14 years in the making
22,The way there were so many deaths in this episode and only a few were boogy kills
2,dude! that issue with the doors! I remember watching redstone tutorials for opening the two doors at the same time
46,14:15 sounds crazy with etho saying it lol
3,Etho are you gonna be crafting Notch apples
1,53:45 Love that
0,"etho you need to get into ghibli, watch at least the classics like spirited away and howls moving castle. grave of the fireflies is also one of my favorites but it is extremely sad"
0,"I'll always love you Etho, no matter how washed"
0,I find it funny that scar always kill etho even when they are in the same team
162,"18:57 ""LOOKS LIKE THE HAMMER JUST FOUND A NAIL!"""
3,Etho you have to craft a god apple
910,"When Grian showed the ""the spot"" I immediately knew. What a cool callback"
1,Are Etho and Bdubs TRYING to die with their lack of decent armor? Lmao
422,Etho should drop two diamonds into lava in front of skizz next episode
8,"Etho's general game mechanics are about a B+
Etho's game mechanics when it comes to pranks are an S++ tier"
0,Tumbo Tekko is a great addition to the series
0,this is so peak
0,Etho‚Äôs POV!!!!!! üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
0,"Good News: I'm pretty sure the 2 people in a hole not being able to get out thing is in future versions. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Hardcore where Doc and his teammate got stuck in a hole was after Beta.

Bad News: I'm sure people will see it coming now that you've tried."
0,I hope that tango being played by someone else is a staple now
7,"if episode 1 had life series 1 mechanics (none) and episode 2 has life series 2 mechanics (boogeyman), maybe we can expect a similar gimmick next sessions so next one is going to be double life with a random partner probably.

probably next session is going to be either 1.0 release, or maybe they go all the way to 1.5. usually life series end in 8 episodes and they have to reach 1.21 by 8.that means we have 6 episodes to basically jump 21 versions. i assume that 1.0,    1.5,    1.9,   1.16,   1.18 and  1.21 are good candidates 1.13 could also be one

1.0 is the release
1.5 is the redstone update
1.9 is the combat update (<-most hated for me)
1.16 is nether update
1.18 the update the changed the world
1.21 current one

1.13 is the update aquatic btw"
7,"etho, studio ghibli is going to change your life"
6,"man i love seeing all the old tech and stuff; the redstone obisidian stuff is something that lives in my heart forever and i kinda wish was still in the game just for fun
really hope you milk some squids when squids; its my favourite bug in the game ever (assuming you dont skip straight to a version where its patched next episode)"
0,fun fact Etho killing Joel in revenge for him boogey killing smajor is the second time Smajor has been instantly avenged by his teammate after being boogey killed by Joel in the life series
0,"THIS is what last life should be

no overbearing stup!d gimmicks

just entertaining players.playing classic mimecraft

i just want the latest version of minecraft smp with ONE new gimmick and no other gimmicks every season.  one light gimmivk that doesnt completely overpower everything else"
4,I clearly remember when Pistons were a mod... And it feels like Trap Doors were added yesterday...
0,I FORGOT IT WAS PAST LIFE TODAY this is great news
1,"Very on-brand for the Rushmore faces to be blocking ""sacred"" land."

0,You know I thought this was the panorama world last episode but when nobody mentioned it I was doubting myself.
2,oh my god the boat prank brings me back
3,this might be my favourite life series so far because of all the nostalgia
0,Etho I‚Äôm sure that trick you did on grian and bdubs will work on a different version coming up I remember that killing people in UHC multiple times
20,Gem and Pearl trapped in a hole for an hour would've been hilarious üòÇ
7,Petition for Etho to make a new mini series continuing chocolate island in 1.7.3

5,30:48 Etho not having seen any Ghibli movies is SHOCKING
1,The Eats-road trial was honestly so nostalgic
1984,Etho having Kakashi as his minecraft skin but now knowing Ghibli is so unreal but its etho so
5177,"""I saw some animes""  etho said while wearing an anime skin"
6,I‚Äôve been refreshing all morning
812,10:58 Probably the most emotive Etho has ever been
1,Horn idea: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing you crazy psycho!?!?‚Äù
7,"Hey Slab, just wanted to let you know I recently got into Bonsai, and as I started researching plants and such, it reminded me of your work on your greenhouse. I hope you‚Äôre doing well and taking time for both youtube and yourself, love ya lots buddy"
0,I just noticed it's so easy to snoop and steal because the chests aren't entities yet so it's completely silent.
102,ethos about to go on a studio ghibli rabbit hole. when i first discovered it i was obsessed
645,"The 1x1 hole thing was _way_ later. It was in mindcrack UHC season 12 with Docm and JL2579, which would have been during 1.6 (horse update), long in the future still."

0,E to the T to ur mom?
0,I need a counter for how much red stone Etho has been gifted each episode
0,"i'm honestly surprised none of you thought to build a quick and dirty water dump farm, water harvesting fully grown wheat was a thing by that version if i remember correctly, and there were a lot of designs that didn't need redstone, i've still got a couple built in my old singleplayer world where you just yanked out a dirt block to flood the field, then put it back to stop the water, and manually collected the pile at the bottom of the field and replanted from the side rails so that you didn't step on the farmland.  It was painful and slightly hilarious seeing everyone forget crop crushing existed though.  Seeing an older version of the game again did give me that warm fuzzy yet slightly homesick feeling though.  nice to see you all having fun with it though ^_^"

0,"I very much doubt it would happen, but I think it would be hilarious if when beta 1.7.3 is reached - one former minecracker kurtjmac shows up still on his journey to the farlands."
1,I watched a bunch of pov's and I think Etho might win this season due to how well he did this episode and even if it updates I think It will take at least 6 episodes if this is a regular length season and I know that some people that are better at new game will be better then I think its likely that they lose almost most of their lives before then another person I think will do well is impulsesv however in the first episode he didn't do to much and I'd like to bring up ethos teammates like smajor will help them stay alive and I know the players won't let him win another season so etho won't have to worry about him and the others won't be that bad or good
3,I was so waiting for someone to say that at least Etho's hair color is accurate.

0,"I'm loving the nostalgia. It's like a trip down memory lane.

I started playing in 2013, and a lot of stuff was in Java by then, but I was playing on my tablet. I don't remember what we called that version, because this was before it became Bedrock. And anyway, the tablet version of Minecraft was very basic and didn't have all the Java frills.

I would mine around any redstone ore I found because redstone ore didn't drop any redstone dust. But it was going to be in a future update, so I left all the redstone ore in my worlds' mines so I could get it later."

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS) and a quality engineer in the U.S., said that he had learned about the CCP‚Äôs live organ harvesting when he attended a meeting in Houston, where a Falun Gong practitioner talked about her experience of being forced to work for no pay and having her blood drawn in a forced labor camp.

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS)

After watching the film, he was both sad and angry. Mr. Stansell said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to accept that there‚Äôs a country and a government behind this. We rely on the government to protect us and guard us, but a government is doing this. It‚Äôs really heartbreaking, frustrating, infuriating, and sad.

‚ÄúThose who stick to their beliefs deserve our admiration. They endure all kinds of torture and do not abandon their beliefs. This really makes many of us ashamed.‚Äù

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club‚Äôs Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club from Kansas, U.S., finished watching the movie in tears. ‚ÄúThis is so heartbreaking. I can‚Äôt bear it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is so shocking, it‚Äôs hard to believe this is true, it‚Äôs hard to believe this kind of thing can happen in the world.‚Äù

0,"Just came across a somewhat older pack ""Techopolis 3"" that looks like it's right up your alley, though it may also be a bit too repetetive. Still, since I loved the Project Ozone LP so much, wanted to let you know. It's more heavily focused on production or I should say industry and can also be played as Skyblock version (which I think is probably more appealing). Ex Nihilo is also replaced by something else (dont wanna spoil) so at least that core part is very different"
0,"I gotta say I love this series so far. Even though its a life series and sh1t is going to go down someday but this start is so humble and chill, I love all the old school builds and mechanics!"
0,Etho really did just instinctually grab all the mossy cobble cause it used to be super rare
0,Etho you need to use your old intro im begging you pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease
0,"ETHOOO you gotta win, Im rooting for you!"
3,"This is literally Ethos bag! He‚Äôs sorry so much time playing all of these early editions of Minecraft. Im sure some of these players have never even played this and the next few editions.

I‚Äôd also love to see a clay tribute Chocolate Island!"
0,Bro I was like 2 when this version came out.
0,"50:39 I think I remember my cousins saying something about the biome difference affecting crops as well back then. I could be wrong, though."

0,He's not washed! It has been decided!
0,‚ÄúIt all coming back to me now‚Äù
0,"Hell yeah, love having Martyn around"
0,Oh goodness it‚Äôs bdubs old skin

2,"I haven't had a smile this big on my face in a long time, once again Etho proves himself Peak"
1,"4 bros, Chillin' in a hot tub..."
0,"This is so validating, I remember thinking only smart people could figure out how WATER works in minecraft lmao, I come back a couple years down the road and I'm like... it's so easy how was I so dumb, turns out I stayed dumb, I still am too dumb to know how beta water works it's a nightmare lmao"
0,I never new Martyn was apart of the yogscast! Those are the og group I could rewatch there old videos to this day!
0,48:16  honestly here I was just appreciating how they made every block pixel by pixel
0,I remember when I used to play back in the day and remember that fences were all sticks then making them later on after haven‚Äôt playing in years I remember being so lost like what you meannn it‚Äôs not sticks anymore I used to have to google it every time it would confuse me
1,"Nostalgia to the max, especially bringing up the yogscast üí•"
1,This was a massive throw back. The conversation with martin gave me flashbacks to watching yogscast and remembering those songs
0,2:25 idk why but skizz question made me pause for a moment and replay it to rehear what I Heard
0,Wow you guys have the manliest team this season with your cool manly cottagecore cabin
0,"9:50

I've been wanting to do this forever. The nastalgia is so strong. I know Minecraft was just in its infancy, but memory serves that it was kind of a better game back then.

Also, I'd like to say I've been watching etho since back then. The golden era of YouTube as a whole. Crappy screen recorders, bandicam and fraps with the fps in the corner. We didn't have the phone cameras of today, so all the videos were 240p.. Ugh, take me back"
0,Etho better win this season
0,finally life series where etho is op
0,Did he toss a diamond in the lava?
0,When the modern folks turned back the time to witness the legends' prime ahh moment

0,"Scott is the best ally to have in this series, he won't betray allies 100% and he himself has no interest in winning. Also the best pvp guy there, at least on the later versions of minecraft. This might be really Etho's season."
1,Should‚Äôve had Kurtjmac in this one
0,i am going to cry tears of joy if there are boat contraptions featured in this series
0,we need u to downgrade ur mic and recording setup back to the 2011 days to get the true experience
0,"People used furnaces for traps as part of a BUD system.  The furnace cooks for a long time before turning off, which then triggers a block update.  It was a small clock, basically, and all you had to do was cook a stack of cobble."
0,"Is it just me, or does Gem sound like Jinx from Arcane??"
0,"Etho's such an absolute menace in this. Hoarding redstone, sharing old traps, planting trees---marvellous chaos, very fitting for the series :D"
0,I love how the creeper blew the wool off the sheep.
1,Etho cuts out happy pride lol

0,This seems like a very bingeable series
2,Oldschool etho shenanigans.
0,haha its wild seeing this big popular youtubers not knowing anything about early Minecraft. They aren't real OGs
0,The lighting at night kinda feels like old terraria lighting? Idk why
2,"Etho: gets new computer, to play beta 1.2 lmao"
2,Etho first played Minecraft Beta 1.2 in his LP episode 13. He also started recording things in 720p then as well. üòÜ
2,Sick Gem sounds like Jinx :O
0,Can't wait for EATS roads haha
2,Etho talking about SoI is a weird mental ich scratched that I didnt even know I had.
0,Really enjoyed this episode. I was thinking of the Yogscast while watching and it was cool to hear the little bit of lore about Martin playing Um Bongo. Looking forward to next week's episode!
25,"Etho's an alpha amongst beta's 37:20 the way I screamed when he beat gem trololololol, I had a stupid grin on my face the entire episode"

1,WAZZAAAAAAP üíÄ
0,I remember how nice it was when infinite water source was added. It was not in the original version.
4,"I actually prefer ""Sulphur"" over ""Gunpowder"" because of the simple fact that there aren't any guns in Minecraft."

1,I love how etho is practically teaching everybody how to play minecraft again
0,Etho not throwing the first diamond into the lava felt weird
1,I‚Äôm home
0,"10:15 I'm so glad to hear this, because that was exactly my problem with Minecraft when I played it in 1.0. I didn't understood I had to keep the left mouse button pressed and I kept spamming it. It took the entire first day to mine some wood and than I died in the first night.
I just came back to it a week later (I think) after some friends joined."
0,Petition for Etho to Build an EATS road.
78,scott using etho as a travel guide is sooo funny üò≠üò≠üò≠
505,38:08 IÔ∏è love how illegal this fight was. Like this is just straight up green on green violence. And everyone just decided it would be funny anyways.
0,"3:41 I think the trap Etho is referring to is the trap Zisteau made (and never used) back in the Mindcrack days that was essentially just a massive pit lined with furnaces. You couldn‚Äôt shift-click interactable blocks to place blocks on them in the old versions, so if you tried to pillar out or bridge off of the central platform, you‚Äôd just open the furnace‚Äôs inventory. Anyone caught in the trap would essentially just be forced to jump down the pit and die.

This will probably get patched out by the time Etho is on a red life, but it would be fun to see this concept come back in 2025"
0,He really is into parkour lately
0,the grin on my face as i watch this. boutta check if theres a new How to survive and thrive video after this

31,"Etho please blow their minds with ‚Äúredstone transmutation‚Äù you can turn redstone into obsidian for the next few versions, 1.2-1.7, just put redstone where the block will form in a cobblestone generator, flowing water+flowing lava+redstone makes obsidian to build a portal with one lava bucket.  Will be legendary knowledge for all these new guys üòìüòìüò∂‚Äçüå´üò∂‚Äçüå´"
0,"the forest just eternally burning down in the background during the cabin arc is great, nobody even mentions it."

0,I think fences underneath farmland didn't prevent it before 1.6. Sneaking should though

0,I will be watching this
0,"I really miss the old like seed or wheat thingy stage growth, no matter what, I get always confused with the current one either if it's actually fully growth or not, unless there's one that actually look different from the rest XD"
0,11:23 someone is for sure going to make an edit where it cuts to Grian losing his mind with the diamonds
0,The level of nostalgia has just hit me so hard. I've been watching Etho since day 1. Chocolate island and all. Who remembers the clay? Spaz? I'm only 20 minutes in and having such a good time. The boat stuff is so good lmao

0,The juxtaposition of Grian‚Äôs episode where he goes absolutely insane trying to find diamonds while Etho and Scott just stumble over them every 5 minutes is hysterical
0,"""there's no monopolizing in this series"" meanwhile etho with all the redstone on the server on session one....."
0,I'm looking forward to next episode where they can run but not up stairs only half slabs
0,"8:46 you have no idea how much i miss finding diamonds like this, caves and cliffs was amazing and all, but i wish theyd kept diamonds spawning just above deepslate. Got the 360 version for Christmas when i was 13 in 2013 after playing it with my friend on their computer. Man i feel old üòÇ"

0,Oh the good ol' times lol
0,everyone giving Etho redstone xD
0,Oh my; I miss these days üòÖ
0,"can't be certain bout these things, but I believe crops need sky. like they can only be outside, on the surface, not underneath a roof, not under naturally occuring blocks. actual sky sky. also, more light is better, so yeah, don't skimp on lighting. every block of crop needs at least 4 light sources next to it on all sides."
0,hold space to not take fall damege in water
0,51:04 It's because it needs to be planted soil. At least if I remember right.
1,I can‚Äôt wait for this version of etho just living nostalgia

0,Pause and Beef anyone?
1,This was such a great episode. This has got to be in my top 10 favorite etho videos.
0,Etho is like the old man NPC from Terraria
0,i love how dark beta nights are
0,1:04 RIP CAPTAIN
0,Etho is in his battleground now
0,"My first ever Etho video, and also my first Minecraft video ever, first gaming video I had ever watched, was the old beta wood duplication glitch with boats, cactus, and no mics. Shoutout to the return"
0,33:23 yeah she does hahaha she sounds so sad
0,etho is like ahh yes we're back
0,"OK but Scott's story about when he first tried playing minecraft is so interesting to me 'cause I remember the first time I tried to play it I knew nothing about it and had only heard it mentioned and how much people liked it - so I spawned in at night and just kept getting killed by mobs and until it was finally daytime, then I just kept tapping things and wandering around and there was literally just grass and trees and I was like ... well, this sucks - and I didn't play again for years until I started randomly watching minecraft videos üòÖ"
0,I remember watching some of Etho's earlier videos where the other players were teasing Etho about being young.  Now he's the old pro.
0,Love how Etho decided to go back to his old skin during this series. Such great attention to detail.
0,This same concept was something I wanted to do back when release 1.0 came out lmao looks fun
2,Etho should bring back the old intro for this series!
0,Etho can you play vintage story  please ? ‚ù§
0,Name the pumpkin guy Mykol.
0,"Etho missed the opportunity to use his old intro, also sad to see he didn't throw the diamonds in the lava to piss someone off lmao"
0,i love this team-up! this was so nostalgic and i love seeing how happy you are in your element!
0,"Etho, ""whassup"" wasn't 2011. That commercial was only on the air from, 1999 to 2002."
0,If the next version is 1.8 where blocking with a sword was a thing then I feel everyone should at least try pvp if they want.
0,Haha I love this so much <3
0,They must have known what we wanted most! Thanks for the nostalgic dive back into Minecraft Beta!
1,"16:00 Bdubs watching having flashbacks of screaming ""ONE POINT THREEEE"""
0,great vid etho
0,"I'm gonna be honest. I think Secret Life was the peak idea, and I wish you guys stuck with that instead of trying to invent new gimmicks that are inferior just for the sake of doing something new."
0,Petition to do RFW again.
0,Memories
0,19:44 Can't believe Etho let that one go
0,Shadow of Israphel.... Old boats.... The OOMFH sound effect.... I'm instantly brought back 15 years. I love this.
0,"Oh, how I've missed you beta minecraft"
0,51:48 the CLAAAWW!   lol
15,Etho‚Äôs insistence on full torch coverage makes a lot of sense when you see how things used to be
0,This video must be watched in 360p
0,Old wheat texture brought back memories.. crazy!!
0,no dropping a diamond into lava
0,"Boat button? Thought you didnt have a mic back in the beta Etho, this doesnt feel right."
0,WAZAAAAA
0,"41:25 I believe it was that you need to log out and log in, and then the sand looks solid."
0,Placing saplings next to the rejects base took me back. Still a great troll üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0,"I like the fact that almost instantly, Etho and Scott found diamonds while Grian and Pearl suffered for approximately 47 minutes"
0,Gem voice very sexy this episode xP
0,I love everybody handing Etho the method of their destruction (redstone)
0,"3:33 ""this is back when you weren't washed"" üòÇ I loved that the washed up joke keeps continuing forward"
0,"when's the last time you've played beta minecraft, etho?"
1,ouch poor gem. that voice sweet child.
0,1:45 oh my gosh i'm dying laughing
0,Etho you should recreate your famous base.
0,"The reason the crops are not working because it needs sunlight/sky can not farm in cave or building, I did a lot of experimenting as a young fella."
0,"3:50 Furnaces were used as traps because in this version there is no sneak + place.
Pakratt used this on mindcrack in a (failed due to discovery) prank where the trapped person would be unable to escape as they couldn't reach the walls or bridge to escape a fall trap."
0,"my favourite part of this new season is how everyone's standards for building have adjusted for beta minecraft XD 
tbf the cabin house is pretty cool <3"
0,The firstborn elf tells the people of Middle-earth how they lived before they saw the light of Valinor
0,"Between my nostalgia and Etho's nostalgia, this was really fun to watch."
0,47:28 NO WAY UM_BONGO WAS JUST MENTIONED IN 2025 üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
0,I absolutely love watching Etho play old Minecraft again. I've watched through his entire LP like 5 times. Place the fences under the dirt so you don't trample farmland. SMP was always way glitchier than single player.
0,this series was made specifically to give etho a playable visualizer of his entire adult life
3,Oddly enough they wouldn't feel anything different if you show this to anyone who watches etho back in 2011. Just a usual Etho let's play
0,i'm just so impressed someone ported the voice chat mod to beta minecraft
0,Love it and going down memory lane myself .... I remember as if it was yesterday .... I was addicted to MC at  once! And so afraid of the mobs that I played in peaceful mode for a long time. üòÖ Thanks Etho for the joy you bring ‚ù§
0,Etho is back on top!
0,So I guess the falling sand is a conversion pit?
0,Goated intro
1,"This might be the latest I‚Äôve been to an Etho video in years, looking forward to this series and your perspective. Thank you for the free content Etho!"
0,"Most people: what is this messed up version
Etho: ahhh nostalgia"
0,Great episode!
0,When I started playing
0,anyone else remember the PC Gamer timed demo?
0,I miss that terrible looking cobblestone and those old sounds.üò¢
0,Grandchildren are so ungrateful.
0,Etho is the goat. It‚Äôs fun to watch these youngsters that missed the OG days. They‚Äôll be doing the same for someone later.
0,"OK this was such a nostalgia tip, i could tell etho was enjoying himself a lot lol"
1,"Ohhhh yesss, I've been waiting for a Etho and Scott team up!"
0,28:10 I remember in old versions you had to build your fences on a block. Meaning you had to start from the top and remove and replace blocks downward. It was a unique buolding experience to say the least
0,Man this takes me back to me watching all Ethos RFW videos.. I'm 34 with 3 kids who love minecraft now
0,"if Etho doesn't win this series, i will commit a crime."
0,"This reminds me of Etho playing Sethbling's Death swap which was the first Etho video I ever watched, great video üíØ"
0,I'm a bit sad Etho didn't throw his first diamond in lava. That would've been absolutely epic. <3 This is gonna be a great series! Also the Gem PVP was a nailbiter.
0,Ive watched every LIFE series and for some reason this video gave me more joy than almost any episode ever. <3
0,"Hey protop for versions pre 1.8 beta, 
You can farm a stack of wheat and get on demand bread with that if you have a crafting bench to save on inventory space."
0,Nostalgia: the Minecraft episode
0,you should reupload this with your intro edited into the part where you do an impression of it
0,I watched you growing up and this just bring me right back to then.
0,LETS goosooosoooooooooüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
0,"Fkin Gem , "" God ur so old"" also what is up with her voice ?"
0,Everything about this just feels correct. I personally have been watching etho since 2012 and this is so nostalgic
0,Shouldn't Grian be called Xelqua and be dressed in GREEN? ü§î
0,19:45 I ACTUALLY STARTED CACKLING OUT LOUD
1,"love etho's random team ups, so fresh"
0,"Etho, you should do a solo survival beta series. even if its short. I'd watch just for the nostolgia"
0,Gem bing Strong Sad is the best thing ever!
0,I hope Grian was furious watching Etho's diamond mining session
0,Just because Im filled to the brim with nostalgia and it was the most mind blowing thing I seen at the time. What are the odds of seeing a EATS road?
0,The only way this could be more 2012 YouTube meta is for it to be released uncut and unedited. Just a straight 2 hour video. Also it starts with the Skype call sound.
0,Why did ethos pov not change? I thought they were traveling time
0,EATS road when?
1,"im rooting for etho, jimmy and skizz to win!"
1,the fishing rod meta is going to go crazy!
0,This whole episode felt like Easter egg references to the LP and I am so happy rn
0,"Shadow of Israphel...
Man, I'm old!"
0,its really funny how everyone is placing torches like light level 1 stop spawns lol
0,Introducing them to kamakaze creepers
0,I‚Äôm not seeing anyone mention this on any videos but everyone is complaining abt the wheat turning into dirt. It‚Äôs cause y‚Äôall keep walking over it and trampling the crops!
0,I can‚Äôt tell if Etho is being sarcastic about being in his late teens in 2011 üòÇ
0,"Scars just floating for a majority of the video. üòÖ
It's easily seen 29:08 üòÇ"
0,I must have a fear something related to darkness cause the stars in the sky at 31:05 are freaking me out internal üòÇ they look like eyes
0,lol
0,Etho is in his element rn
0,We love etho slab
0,Dude this IS ETHOS series fkin amazing idea
3,I love how this is Trending on gaming and we have Etho in-between a bunch of other videos that have their thumbnails made to bring viewers in.  This episode is just such a blast from the past talking about the old boat mechanics and the other charm of Beta Minecraft (though one thing I never got is that Mojang years ago went back and changed old sounds such as doors and explosions (if you are wondering what they sounded like go watch Minecraft videos from 2011)). Though one of the best thing was the conversations with all the call back to those early Minecraft days brings back so many memories.
0,"As soon as I saw the premise for this season, I knew Etho would THRIVE."
18,God watching this brought up so many memories like how mossy cobblestone use to only be found in spawners so Etho dug it up
0,Etho was striving in this version
0,Etho will win this season
0,Etho 1.0: The Series is finally here
0,"Etho.. Feels like if you build wooden house, use the slab version since it wont get burned in old version and even when they changed into petrified slab."
0,The juxtaposition between Etho giving Scott lessons on Beta mechanics while casually finding diamonds to Joel and Jimmy screaming miserably through the cave slays me
0,Is this team B.E.G.S.?
0,I can‚Äôt wait for chocolate island
0,this is the minecraft of my memories omg
0,I play infdev 20100415üòä in the version I play in negative coordinates mobs spawn during the day and in the western coordinates their pathfinding is broken. However negative coordinates are north and west because the sun rises in the north and sets in the south. However..... Don't be out at night just saying. There are no caves and ores are much bigger like iron gold and diamonds. You can find a 23 vein of diamonds!!! I also found a 43 vein of iron a few times lolüòÖ
1,everyone coming to Etho for advice is so wholesome
890,Gem's sick voice makes her sound soo sad and devastated talking about the saddle 33:10
0,Etho please craft the God Apple next next session
0,"Were taking a ride on  a magic time machine :D

It would be amazing if GS made a camio üëÄ"
0,"just gonna say, i have loved every Life series.  they are all so creative in their premise.   this one was completely unexpected  HAHHA.  well done everyone, i cant wait to see the rest of the episodes"
1,If etho do not win this life series then he was always washed
0,13:01 Talk about foreshadowing! üòÇ
10,"The, ""God you are old"" kills me so damn much. Both because of how deadpan it is and how direct and funny it is, but also because it hurts me physically to my core, because I too am old."
0,"Coming from Grian‚Äôs video to yours, the ease with which you‚Äôre finding diamonds is hilarious! üòÇ"
0,3 mins in and Etho is already parkouring

0,Unc still got it‚ù§‚Äçü©πüåπüåπ
0,Legitimately such a nostalgia trip watching this. Just needed a terrible mic and it would have been perfect.
0,When ethos goes ‚Äúred stone! Mine!‚Äù It reminded me of his first episode of Minecrack when him and guude were helping bdouble0 build a mob spawner farm and he said ‚Äúdiamonds! Mine!‚Äù (I checked because I thought he said red stone not diamond
0,What a trip down Memory Ln.
0,Reminds me of ethos boat highways days
0,"What a nostalgia trip. Old Minecraft was a completely different game than it is now. It‚Äôs definitely been improved, but I think the old is fun and entertaining in ways that the current version can‚Äôt be."
0,etho you have no idea how much of a good idea you playing beta minecraft again is
0,"beta 1.3 was my start in MC so it's really nostalgic and special for me to watch Etho and gang play this :,)"
0,It is so nice to see Etho playing the old minecraft again!
0,"How the heck did they get proximity voice working, did someone really backport it to a ton of old versions?!"
0,Not watched a etho video in years üò¢

0,Oo i can't wait to see the infinite obsidian trick with lava and redstone
1,the goat etho is in his element
1084,Etho don't let Joel make you insecure that 2011 intro is still great
0,Wow! Gem's on a pig!
2,Oh man this is so great the discussion about the Minecart boosters at 42:00 I remember seeing a huge rail station YouTube video and that was what got me to finally buy the game to try and make my own - must've been around this version. The good old days!
0,"This makes me so happy. I started playing in Beta 1.3 and it's crazy how many of these janky old mechanics I remember. The mind of a mildly obsessed child is a steel trap, it seems."
0,9:51 Etho sounds sooo happy üòÅ ‚ù§
0,This was very refreshing to watch
0,Easily best Minecraft video I‚Äôve watched in about 8 years
0,Chocolate island when?
0,This is so funny watching everyone flounder around and Etho is over here IN HIS HOME TERF LOL!
0,This video made my back and knees hurt ü•≤ pure nostalgia
0,"47:30 even the shadow of israphael reference, im crying..."
0,"I have a glitch I found playing multiplayer on my own server if you want to give it a try, it was really good for getting out of cave systems, if you mine into a wall and suffocate yourself with gravel, log out of the server and log back in, it would teleport you to the nearest above air block, I remember doing it in 1.7.3 beta all the way up to 1.2 release I wanna say, but I've never seen it anywhere else, makes me wonder if my server was just a lil bugged"
0,5:41 love that Etho still gets a thrill of finding iron early game üòÅ
0,He‚Äôs totally crafting a dozen mending + infinity bows when the time comes‚Ä¶.
0,You gotta make an eats road at some point
4821,"In this episode, Etho:

The flashbacks i just got O-O"
0,I can‚Äôt wait for boat grieving
5,This was so nostalgic and so much fun! Etho in his element! Can‚Äôt way for the rest of this series! Bring back the EATS road
1,"It's not that we need to rehash dynamics from previous seasons... but come ON. Etho is at his most Server Dad mode here, and he happens to group with BDubs and Scar. Which I guess would make Scott their new step-dad?"
59,"The juxtaposition between the new Minecrafters and the veterans is so amazing in this episode, idk why but the chat with martin was kinda surreal"
1,13:28 ETHO HOW OFTEN DID YOU GET TURNT BACK THEN!?
0,This is great!üòÑ
29,"he was talking about a nostalgia trip, THIS IS A NOSTALGIA TRIP. And something Etho has taught me through my life is as long as you truly care about your passions, and you take care of yourself the best you can, those who are with you will find you. The start of this is a humorous full circle feeling for me being 23 now, and thank you Etho. For inspiring me and all of us! Beta was a lot of our starts because of you, and we enjoy it the same :D"
0,lol why does Gem sound so traumatized? Guess she‚Äôs the next vid I‚Äôll watch!
0,"‚ÄúI could have sworn these things were like hard to get in the past.‚Äù
Meanwhile, Grian"
0,Etho playing beta brought back memories I had long forgotten
0,"I didn't start watching until 1.7.9 which was about 2014, so I was 3 years late to the party."
25,"Oh my god the nostalgia blast back to the Chocolate Island days when I would watch after school üò≠
Etho should for just a couple minutes talk super quietly and shy like he used to to really bring us all back haha"
3,Etho is in his element here
0,The life series has now seen chocolate island
0,Has to be my favorite Minecraft YouTube video I‚Äôve seen in a while.
2,The poor developer who had to port voice chat to a ton of ancient minecraft versions that don't even have modloaders :(
12,everyone giving Etho their redstone is so sweet and funny üò≠
0,"Man, this genuinely makes me wish that Etho played older versions more often, maybe with some of the other Hermits. Yeah its janky but there's a certain cozyness to it. I didn't realize how much I missed this..."
0,Really miss these times! The memories are flooding. I remember the first time I saw the E.A.T.S. And the mine cart booster I thought it was the coolest thing and incorporated them in all my worlds. Keep up the amazing work Etho! And let the memory of simpler time remind you that you don‚Äôt need to try too hard. Just enjoy the journey.
0,"Guys, Etho might actually win some PVP here. I'm so ready for the arrow spam"
8,Etho as the keeper of ancient knowledge was so funny.
0,"Hey Etho
It is you but without the squeaky chair and ASMR voice.
Love the well, just need to put a mushroom next to the well and it will be perfect.
This is going to be so much fun to watch.
Glad you are enjoying yourself."

0,Someone tell me this is the series where Etho wins
61,"This has been the sweetest POV i‚Äôve watched T-T hes just like nostalgia-ing, and im nostalgia-ing right with him. This episode made me realize that Etho really HASNT changed that much since when i would watch him a long time ago, he‚Äôs always been so STEADILY ‚ÄúEtho,‚Äù one of the one things steady about my life tbh üòÖ 

I also love how everyone is like asking Etho how to play xD 

‚ÄúThis is your unwashed version,‚Äù a funny line but shockingly true xD Etho was never washed, minecraft just *un*washed üò≠ The part where they were all gathered around being like ‚Äúof course its etho who‚Äôs nerding out right now‚Äù omg that sent me xD Same with them talking like its 2011 xD


(Also, the second i saw etho run towards Joel i nearly shrieked, boat boys two electric boogaloo would be epic)

Etho is going to win this, and i am so excited."

2,"Watching this just takes me back to when I was 12 and watching legendary and canopy carnage, so good"
3,"Your perspective was so delightful. It was such a nice showing to the younger crowd of precisely how and why the bdubs, tangos and impulses of the world truly respect you so much."
1,YESSSSSS LIFE SERIES IS OUT
2,1:41 Joel is so obsessed with Etho he knows there has only been one intro ever since episode 81.

7,All these glitches must have been a nightmare lol Torches didn't light anything up at all even you spamming it xD lol mobs were s-tier in fighting back then huh? xD
2,The background at 23:21 is absolute old Minecraft aesthetic

0,this is so nostalgic and wholesome it‚Äôs crazy
2,"Oh wow! Gem sounds really sick. And she still recorded that day anyway! Normally I wouldn't say or notice, but this one actually made me hurt to hear. I was once sick in the throat and the sound making place. Felt bad!"

2,Lmfao gem sounded like jynx it was so bizarre

61,I wish Docm was in this series. Dude was the king of old Minecraft
0,"I haven‚Äôt watched Etho in YEARS, what did I miss?"
0,Back when Evo was running someone who was watchinh built a redstone piston door in old Minecraft to show it could be done. Might be fun to show off an anachronistic technology.
0,"this bring back the memories, im a little bit dissapointed that ther is not the old satisfying door click"
4,"Etho, I would 100% watch a (probably relatively short) little like redo of old minecraft. Like what Zisteau tried doing for a bit, maybe? You seem to have a great time with the old mechanics and it's really fun to watch."
5,"I love how Etho spent the video being called old, and then talked to Martin about his time at Yogscast and the minecraft parodies he did back in the day. Really felt like rock meets stone."
1,ngl this was so very wholesome. why did i enjoy this lol
0,etho back in the beta like when I first watched is crazy
1,Immediately doing parkour lol :D

0,"oh i have good memories with these versions :) so nice to revisit it. Wow, I have been playing this game for a long time, haven't I :D I know the game didn't have all the features but still it felt quite magical. (I played since beta 1.2) I remember watching Etho's videos, back then I didn't have a youtube account and I couldn't even speak/understand english (watched anyway and tried to imagine what you were saying). Your videos have been a great motivation for me to learn english, so thank you Etho for that :)"
4,I would honestly watch a whole series just in alpha/beta minecraft
0,You should try editing and styling each video as if you were making it at that time!

0,Dude.... this is wonderful ‚ù§
1,this is awesome!! how did they get the proximity mod working on this ancient stuff lol
0,Can‚Äôt wait to see the the updates to when enchanting is broken. Like a mending and infinity bow
0,"Man, you four will make a great team!!! Amazing!!"
1,"53:02 ""Who woulda thought"", the correct response was ""Not me"" lmfao"
1,"I¬¥ve been watching Ergo for a looong time. I went through elementary school, high school, university and I m working my job now while still watching every single video of our friend Etho, yet this was still before my time"
1,"13:55 ""You'all wanna get turnt?"" (dies)"
0,"Screw the Nether by InTheLittleWood is still the only song I ever bought on iTunes, and it was on my ipod touch back in 2012. This episode is a nostalgia trip."
0,Etho spouting off game facts and trivia like a machine!
0,"The perfect team of scammers. Scar (no explanation needed), bdubs steals and blames it on others, etho has a good redstone reputation so everyone just gifts him it, and Scott who is a social mastermind and always manages to be friends with everyone."
32,"The old man in his element. The throwback feels in the episode was so cool. And the throwback discussions with Martyn.
Excellent team up."
2,"Man, there was something so beautiful about older versions of Minecraft. It had more charm by how unrefined it was. There's been so many great additions since, but there is something lost with further refinement of the game."
4,"27:38 Knowing Scar is getting trapped in fences by Grian, is even funnier after seeing this moment üòÇ"
0,üò≠ 2011
2,7:17 etho saying ‚Äòeh‚Äô gave me whiplash
0,Oh my god of course you did parkour in the first 5 minutes. Classic. lol

0,"Talking about creepers moving to the left just brought back the mob sorter, if memory serves the skeletons did the same thing but a different distance to the player..."
0,Unc still got it
131,and here we see the fabled etho slab in his natural habitat
0,"40:30 I remember as a kid, because of Minecraft, buying sulphur from the gardening store and trying to ignite it... Didn't work very well üòÇ"
0,awesome timing lol I just finished Wild Life the other day
0,"1.2 beta is actually the version i started playing the game.  i remenber the ""castle"" i built in a server even. 1.3 beta is when they added beds, and i think repeaters were just added on that one."
379,"I am LOVING the Etho and Scott team up, they‚Äôre both so wholesome. The way Scott was cheering for Etho during his PVP fight against Gem and instantly defending him when Tango called him a liar in the chat and Etho giving him tips and asking Scott to save him when he was stuck in the fence was so sweet. Them along with Scar and Bdubs are gonna be such a fun team, I can‚Äôt wait till next session!"
1,this was my first minecraft version! :D
0,thanks for this! it's a bussy week and this really helps me calm down.

After a day spent in hospital with my pops, this has made my evening."

0,Beta 1.2 was my first MC version
1,Watching the grandfather of minecraft playing in his prime is so cathartic
0,"Looking forward to a minecart booster powered rollercoaster for the pure old school world experience.

Edit: And maybe a boat dispenser?"
0,"7:50 - ""Leather is Better [in this version]"" - We need a new ""And you've been Etho'd!"" now.  üòÖ
I remember that in the early days. I always had leather armor, especially because diamonds were so rare!
36:00 - Even 15 years later I learn something new!"
0,Doop
1,9:06 Etho didn‚Äôt burn his first diamondüòÆ
4,The references to 2011 are killing me because that‚Äôs the year I graduated. I especially loved Scar‚Äôs reference of Hot Tub Time Machine üòÇ
1,Just finished watching and  I'm with Etho on this one. Silly stupid grin through the entire episode. Too bad nobody slept because mobs could randomly spawn and kick you out of the bed. The old lava and cobble textures. Minecart boosters. You must rebuild General Spaz's tower! When did the unburnable slabs come into the game? I remember everyone on Mindcrack hoarding them when they changed from slabs to wood slabs (or whatever) then everybody coming together and rebuilding BDubs arena with them after lightning burned it down. That's what led to King of the Ladder on Mindcrack too. Total nostalgia trip.
0,It's Christmas already?!?!?!??
0,"O Watchers... please let this be Etho's season! 

We're on your side Ladders!"
0,Life was so simple back then....
0,Etho are you gonna chocolate island this map?
0,Oh boy this makes me feel so old it's giving me arthritis
0,"27:15 I love how whenever he is placing logs down, you can see him automatically trying to place it facing the correct way, when that doesn't matter in this version"
0,"The contrast between everyone else going ""This game sucked, wow"" and Etho living his best life (new series idea??? /jk) is great"
1,Etho didn't change Minecraft did. He was never washed just thrown in a different environment.
0,POV: Its 2011 and you're watching etho play Minecraft version 1.2 and you're dad hasnt started to beat you yetü§ßü§ßü§ß
0,Smajor + Etho is an unexpected AMAZING treat
1,How are the data packs and proximity chat working what
2,"Etho was so in his element this episode lmao, he‚Äôs no longer washed!"
2,"32:28 ""God you are old"" Lmao"
0,29:20 that's just spawn protection
0,How will the version update work with the change of terrain generation? Will you reset the terrain or keep some chunks?
1,When worlds collide
0,swearing
73,43:29 the comedic timing of tango calling etho a liar in chat while etho says he hasn't found any redstone yet
0,I love that wherever he goes he collects red stone.
0,I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt get a nose bleed while entering Skizz‚Äôs house
1,Poor gem sounding like Lucille Ball
5,"Even Gems sick voice sounds like a 2011 Minecraft YouTuber

*cinema*"
0,u can make a moveing fan in beta
1,Team BEGS assembled
2,I love how Bdubs has his old skin again. In what version does Etho wish for big eye Bdubs?
3,The technical challenges of this series have to be insane. They have a voice mod on beta 1.2. They are going to have to upgrade the existing world with new features every episode. Very cool!
0,12:00
1,"1:40
""does your intro change since then"" is single handedly is most funny statement"
1,"Aaah, the memories from the MindCrack era flooded my mind"
1,The fighting each version should be gladiator rules where the champion has to fight in the next version.
0,Not familiar with the older versions but I wonder if multiple falling sand in the same block would make it look solid? They seem to snap up into the right position for a moment before falling again so maybe 5-10 sand would overlap enough to look solid!
0,"Hey etho I had a rough day, you made it better. Just wanted to drop some appreciation!"
0,Shadow of Israphel is a callback omg I was so mad they never finished it properly.
0,"I totally forgot that Martyn made Screw The Nether and How Do I Craft This Again?.. loved those songs, even if How Do I Craft This Again kind of became obsolete after the recipe book was added"
364,"Etho please blow their minds with ‚Äúredstone transmutation‚Äù you can turn redstone into obsidian for the next few versions, 1.2-1.7, just put redstone where the block will form in a cobblestone generator, flowing water+flowing lava+redstone makes obsidian to build a portal with one lava bucket.  Will be legendary knowledge for all these new guys."
1,"Goodness, that's a blast from the past. Awesome as always!"
0,i love this dude
0,i love etho acting as an old wise wizard
0,"hm. I'm curious what value the gimmick this time around will bring. how does it cause chaos, or promote interaction? I guess time will tell."
0,WE LOVE TO SEE IT
0,"Man, this is the exact version I started in, and it's hitting me with some major nostalgia"
0,"Love it, I watched Etho from his first episode, and I'm currently playing 1.7.3 beta myself."
0,Anyone else get excited thinking Joel and etho would team up.  Then sad they didn‚Äôt.  Then excited again cause scar and etho?! I bet they will be great together! Cabin core!!
0,It would have been really funny if Etho had changed his skin to something ultra modern and made a new intro and wacky modern editing
2921,watching grian have the absolute worst time finding diamonds to the point where he loses his mind then moving to etho's pov where he and scott are tripping over them is priceless
0,"Etho, if your modded series is on indefinite hiatus, I think you would really enjoy Better Than Adventure as a modpack to play. It rolls back updates to pre-Adventure update and continues from that point on with the Beta/Alpha spirit of things."
1,do u update the same world or reset the world and just keep builds and stuff
0,"How cool is this!!! Love the nostalgia, when food didn't stack and we had no hunger bar"
1,Aww etho sounds so happy ! So animated! üíñ
1,Gem sounds so destroyed üò≠ I hope she's OK
2,27:34 this is a classic.
0,Etho needs to make that random tick tnt timer with the logs
0,"49:45 ""Be there or be square""

Well good sir"
0,cool
0,Willing it into existence: I hope they use the 404 seed before leaving beta.
0,Cmon Etho you have the advantage on this one!!!!
0,"I recently went back and watched your early play with minecraft.  It's amazing that you haven't forgotten any of it! I love seeing your intro every time, as well."
1,I was watching the old Zisteau OCD prank video and Pause and Beef were laughing about seeing Ethos' face while crouching and at 20:30 they're commenting on the same thing all these years later LOL
0,What a flashback! So much fun seeing you flex that old-school knowledge :D
0,"The creeper lore, the mob sorting system, the boats channels. Gosh, just the thought makes me smile"
0,Aww gem and etho are gonna save themselves for each other each episode ‚ù§
1,"I'd give my left arm to be part of the life series, my gosh

anywho, let the fun of a new season begin! :D"
1,Genuinely feels like I've been transported back to episode 1 and we're all learning Minecraft again. Such a standout episode I love it
1,I forgot about Smallishbeans. I remember his sniping only road to commander on MW2.
0,"Oh man im really excited for this series, I wish all of the episodes were out already! Its crazy nostalgic hearing about beta minecraft, etho, and yogscast all in the first episode üòÇ"
0,"call etho washed up again, I dare you lol"
0,This makes me want a mini series where you play 1.1 again. Guess I'll just have to rewatch the lets play from the beginning
0,9:39 Same! the cobble texture!... feeling old but at some time worth it. This is version i decided to buy I think. anyone remember being able to play inside the web browser?
0,"Started a world in infdev last year, currently in preNether alpha. Funny hearing them complain about everything.üòÇ"
0,This is gonna be amazing!
0,YOU DIDNT STRUGGLE FINDING DIAMONDS BACK IN THE DAY YOU BURNT THEM
1,Etho this is your season!! You're going to win!!!
0,Etho are you going to build a 360 cannon at some point
0,Hey etho i have some redstone for you
3,"Man, oh man.  I have a playlist of old Vechs maps played by Guude and BDouble00 from back in the day, and Etho joined them for some of them.  I may have to revisit them after this."
0,Bdubs using his old skin!! What a classic
0,Beta 1.2 !   Having started in 1.3 this is SO familiar... But no beds i guess
0,"Etho, your generosity is so wonderful! ü•πü•πü•π Such a nice chap!"
0,Oh man i started back with Beta 1.2. Pretty sure my 1.2 world had a classic Etho underground mob farm with a mob-a-vator to bring them to the surface for dispatching. Man I'm old. =/
0,"So #PastLife is Minecraft's version of ""back in my day""?"
1,Etho is the master with the old versions.
1,Watching this in 480p for extra nostalgia
55,"20:34 So nostalgic üò≠ I remember watching years back when etho said he'd do a face reveal and that was it, the skin without the layering for his ""real face"""
1,"32:34 ""god you are old"" ‚Äî gem"
1,I never knew InTheLittleWood was Um_Bongo
0,this video was so nostalgic omg
0,=) delightful!  and the combo of the 4 of you is going to be so fun to watch
1,He mentioned Minecraft Monday! My fandoms are colliding!! >_<
0,After 10 minutes it hit me: Is there really a proximity chat mod for such an early version?
1,Smallishbeans is such a whining loser.
8,47:27 SHADOW OF ISRAPHEAL MENTIONED!!!!!
2,Gem voice is somewhat absolutly adorable
1,Haven't watched mc videos in years but all of a sudden I feel like a teenager again watching mindcrack. Its good to be back.
4,Brings me back to a simpler time.
1,I wanted Etho to throw some Diamonds in lava SO BAD :(
0,you've made my day
16,"I love this episode so much, it's taking me back to growing up with the lets play- and it's funny seeing Etho teaching everyone the ins and outs."
0,"I've been watching the let's play from the start for a couple of months now, so this has been great"
0,I love this team ü§£
0,"Etho was just like a camp director to everyone else, showing them all the quirks of beta. absolutely loved it"
1,Can we have a version of the intro with the mouth sound just for this series?
0,"Oh my god, Etho and Marty talking about early minecraft(yogscast) üò¢üò¢ waves of nostalgia mam"
0,Who doesn't love a huge chest *badum tss*
1,"Minecraft wouldn't be Minecraft without Etho.
If they're using every version, does that mean including the April Fools ones as well?
If they are, then EthoSlab might even rear its head."
0,This is amazing. It's adorable watching Etho in his element.
0,The thing with the boat was awesome! If there was just some sort of Boat Dispenser...
0,Feels weird seeing Etho and BDubs together in 1.2 but no Guude.... OOGE!
0,The way you play this version of minecraft...
0,b1.7.3 or 1.0 next?
0,we need an EATS road!
15,Pre-washed Etho is terrifying
0,"oh man i still called sugar cane reeds for YEARS, i cant recall when i stopped actually XD"
2,Etho should've brought back the old headset and mic
0,LIKE WE NEVER LEFT
1,9:54 Is hilarious after watching Grian's perspective where he's just struggling for 40 minutes to find a single diamond
0,Etho: I used to rule the world... Chunks would load when I gave the word...
0,"Etho please consider a Beta series. There are a hoard of Beta 1.7.3 purists plus all of us....and see if you can talk BDubs and Doc into it, too. Pretty please."
0,It‚Äôs so uncanny hearing all the modern sound effects mixed in with old ones
0,I'm more amazed that the proximity voice mod is working for Beta 1.2
0,Etho is in his element. Just like the good old days of the LP.
0,"I wonder if Etho looked some info up, or if he just legit remembers all this. ""Traps"" and creepers being weird is a memory, but pork giving 4 hearts? How would one remember that?"
0,"I started playing Minecraft in either 2010 or 2011, I recall it was before the full release. Looking back, sure there's a lot of features people enjoy now that make the game easier to play...but is that necessarily a good thing? I feel that perhaps the quality of life has gone too far over the years. It isn't much of a game anymore. You were constantly being challenged back then. Nothing soul crushingly difficult or anything of course, but still challenged.  
Just some  thoughts, nothing more."
0,GET YOUR SNACKS!!
0,To be in this series with OGs like Etho and Bdubs would be an absolute dream come true üôåüèΩ
1,I was never here for the uhc era but god this reminds me of the etho uhc era

2,The way you can feel his happiness with the nostalgia ‚ù§üòÇ
8,I miss Mindcrack
1,I'm getting my snacks together cause today is a good day!!!!! (Etho uploaded)
2,The reveal at the end was so good
1,1:57 IT GOES phOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1,:0 shadow of iserfell mentioned
1,"So much nostalgia watching this, think i might rewatch the lp from the beginning again"
1,Kinda disappointed that Etho didn't throw his first diamond in lava üòÇ
1,imagine hermitcraft season but on this version of game
5,Pro-tip: set the video quality to 360 p or lower to make it feel even more nostalgic
1,"Lets go to a place, where everything is made of blocks <3"
1,I think we have a frontrunner for 1st place here!
2,New life series!!!!!
1,That brings back memories ! I did also start on this version ! Which had harder mobs then the actual one in my opinion...I remember having really back luck with diamonds too
2,"if *anyone* deserves to win Past Life, it's Etho. All of my eggs are in the Etho basket."
1,Anyone else getting mindcrack king of the boat flashbacks??
1,Yayayayayayay!

2,Omg I am on vacation and a new Life Series starts and Ethos is in it. Blessed!
8,"""will i die?""
""no you will be fine""
>SolidarityGaming died"
2008,Wait until everyone remembers that enchanting originally required 50 levels
1,"If i'm not mistaken crops needed ""sunlight"" so they couldn't be enclosed. My guess why Tango's farm wouldn't work."
1,"Yeah, Etho definitely will win this life series."
38,"The whole episode is basically just Etho being a grandpa and showing the new kids his old tricks, lol"
8,"Etho, you should build a creeper face somewhere"
1,Etho finally has the advantage in this series
6,Seeing Etho mess around in Beta Minecraft tastes like pure Dopamine. This was delicious!
1,Etho and bdubs were at home in this episode!
1,If you want an authentic experience you'd watch this in 244p lmao
1,"Oh! The end where they're talking about arson, I hope someone crafts some of the old non-flammable oak slabs at some point in the series."
3,It's really strange hearing high quality mics and high energy voices with old minecraft graphics.
1,"‚ÄúHuh, 36 notifications, guess I didn‚Äôt check my YouTube for a while. ‚Ä¶ oh, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù"
1,"washed? nah, still in the shower! wiping the floor with gem"
1,Anyone else wondering what the version gaps between episodes are going to be? Like are we going to be in 1.8 survival update next time or will they stick with beta for one more?
1,Ethos at home in this version lol
1,Etho in his element :)
1,Bdubs and Etho are the most iconic Minecraft duo of all time.

1,i‚Äôm already loving the manly cabin bros
1,Awww shii here we go again
1,I just realized that Etho teamed up with almost the same exact people as when he was in MCC for the first time. Hbomb was with them instead of Bdubs.
7,Nostalgia punch to the face. Remember Etho and Docm as my earliest Youtube experiences. Such good times

1,"Etho always seems to have a bit of a trickster in him, but the opportunity to be silly here is amazing."
1,"Woo! Let's go! Another Etho vid to binge watch on repeat! ‚ù§

When Etho was showing around their builds to Gem, why am I getting little Etho being proud for the builds and showing it to a master /teacher vibes? So proud of you ‚ù§"
1,i'm biased but this is definitely the best perspective to watch this season
5,Etho and Scott stole all of Grians diamonds lol
1,"Aaah. Back when Minecraft was just growing into becoming Minecraft. Plants were still nice and neat in a row and there was the beauty of palette swapping one texture to make so many things. The beauty of that ingenuity and simplicity is long since lost.
Sure it's less harsh on the eyes these days, but that was more down to palette than textures. And I still think it looks like a bug with the plants not aligned to the blocks.
Anyway, so happy to see Etho getting to relive the glory days. You shone bright then and you still do. That's why everyone has such respect for you. You've earned it by hard work and a humble attitude. This is your time to gloat and show those youngsters how it used to be! ;-)"
7,i love everyone‚Äôs reaction to the stairs in the hot bar
1,He's not washed up!!!
2,48:03 Martyn did screw the nether??

3,what a throwback episode with such great Minecrafters
1,"4 guys chilling in a bathtub, 5 feet apart."

213,"The reason their farmland keeps resetting is because they don‚Äôt have crops planted. Empty farmland resets if it‚Äôs walked on, even with a fence"
1,11:32 Why did my boy react so loud to that üíÄ
1,"I recently started watching your lets play series from the start, and now this..."
195,"This might be my first ever YouTube comment in 15 years, but as a long time subscriber I had to say that the nostalgia was off the charts and I loved seeing everyone learn about old school Minecraft! 

Now Etho needs to round up some of the newer Minecrafters and show them what a Super Hostile CTM was like in the beta days 

Thanks for all the amazing content over the years Etho!"

0,21:40 for some reason THIS moment right here was the nostalgia wave for me.  The way the item he's holding on the mouse cursor *sometimes* goes in front of other items on the invenstory grid and *sometimes* goes behind it just....  The absolute *example* of the kind of jank that makes this version of minceraft so special.

2372,I think the timer is to prevent people from making them on site to help with building then killing them afterward.  Basically using them like disposable build aids instead of pets.
0,I‚Äôm convinced you and Blockchain Backer are the same guy.  2 of my favorite YouTube channels.
0,Please show the End sorting system in action! I love watching that thing work!!!!
0,Never lose hope in God and always know that He is by your side amen‚ù§
0,could y maybe update the world folder please. I wanna built the egg room
0,Hey Etho. Do you avoid rain because it affects the bitrate quality of your video? Just wondering. Thanks
0,im the new subscriber bro ill react to your lets play minecraft ‚ù§
0,Is this all survival or creative was used ?
0,"Hey Etho,what's your criteria for picking comment of the day?"
0,Whenever Etho says AHA! it tickles something in my brain
0,Etho for your next mod pack playthrough you should try TerraFirmaGreg. It just got a huge update that I think you would enjoy. Keep up the great videos!
0,"Hey, I was wondering if you explored the pale garden and tinkered with the creaking heart at all. It apparently gives redstone signals based off the distance of the mob it spawns when a player damages it. I'm just curious about what you'd do with them... also resin's pretty neat."
0,"Hey Etho, random question. Why don't you make Posts on your YouTube channel for updates? I know you've used X/Twitter for a long time, but Posts would more directly reach your audience when something's up that's preventing content or if you have a question for us. Perhaps not necessary - but I'm curious!

Love your content. You inspired me to get ""serious"" about playing Minecraft in 2014 and I'll be forever thankful :)"
0,Wow.  First time back to one of your videos in years.  I'm shocked you're still in the same world lol.  That's crazy.  I would have absolutely had to start a new one at some point.  ADHD would have gotten the better of me.
0,Comment History Test
0,"Hey Etho, I haven't played Minecraft in years, and I've only recently begun to learn about what has been released since then.
I've noticed that with recent updates and game drops, you focus on what specifically interests you, but don't acknowledge other features that have been added.
Not that you have to use things from new updates when they are added, but could you at least note things that you know a new version has added, even if you don't plan on checking it out right away?"
0,Bro I use to watch your stuff daily and waiting by the computer 10 years ago. It's good to see you're still around and doing well. Cheers to many more years bro. Thanks for everything ‚ù§
2,"Hey etho, I noticed that you are still walking up a netherrack staircase when putting gold into your piglin bartering system. Have you ever wanted to go through and polish up that project along with others to make it easier to interact with on a player side?"
0,I can imagine you could use the happy ghasts as attack ships against each other!
0,"Etho would you consider playing Vintage Story, as its basically terraforma craft as its own game?"
0,7 MORE EPISODES AND A NEW WORLD TOUR SHOULD BE OUT!! Cannot wait for it hopefully you still do one every 50 episodes
0,How ghastly!
0,"I get the impression that a lot of the issues encountered in this episode is just client sided physics. e.g. the reason slime block launchers don't work well with boats is that when you are driving the boat, the boat's physics are entirely client-sided, while the slime block is on the server side. This does not happen for minecarts since you do not control them the same way.

I find it really disappointing how getting inside a boat that is leashed to a happy ghast results in the boat just dropping down. The player, and vehicles they are controlling, just completely ignore being leashed apparently."
0,Hydraulically reanimated.
1,i wonder if etho still has the cache of bows with both infinity and mending when it was possible because i wonder if he could use those old bows to fly while leading the happyghasts instead of rockets
0,"Etho, you should play with the distant horizons mod."
0,I like the fog. gives the game atmosphere. like the old legacy versions of the game.
0,Hey Etho! Something I‚Äôm wondering about your world is where are your earliest pets. Do you still have your first horse for example? Do you have a favorite pet / captured mob?
0,Can they be sped up by a speed potion? if so maybe a bundle with Speed 2 splash pots could be a viable transport method.
0,"Minecraft: adds new mob to the game
Etho: Okay but how does this relate to parkour"
1,"Etho, kindly asking where is the past life episode of yours?"
2,"Dear, Etho. I think it's time, dude. You've talked about it before. But I think it's really time now. Your world is too big. The mega projects are just machines that get you to another big machine, but you aren't really doing a lot with the materials. Some terraforming. Some Mancave touchups. And everything is so spread out and largely unused...or broken, or you can't remember how to use it...or why. It's time to let it go, man. Time for a fresh start. In my humble opinion. Play well! P.S. the egg chamber was the best thing you've ever done in this world.  I hope you felt like it was time and resources well-spent."
1,One of the things i miss the most is the old dwarfs vs mobs games i would love to see those come back lol I love you videos have been watching them since i was little! you are the best i love seeing you still post minecraft on the same world i would watch when i was young :)
0,I'm wondering about punch bows. Perhaps it could be the new punch bow + elytra combo
0,I love that I got your channel in the divorce. üíïüíïüíï
0,Love you!
0,i love how etho immediately does a bunch of little experiments with the dried ghasts i never would have thought of
0,when are you gonna make a new world Etho? üåé
1,10:49 I think this feature is there to alert players that they‚Äôre nearby in Soul Sand Valleys. Pretty smart tbh.
0,My nephew came over and hopped on the PS and loaded up Minecraft. Made me think back when I used to watch etho all the time. Decided to see if he still makes videos and here I am. I remember when he built the potion room. I was like 12 years old when I first found him and I‚Äôm 26 now üò≠üòÇ nostalgic asf.
3,"This will probably be lost in the comments, but I'll type it out anyways... I've been watching your videos for years now. I must have been in middle school - now I'm finishing my master's in biology. I find myself coming back every so often and bingeing a series and its so relaxing; similar to re-watching an old childhood cartoon. Thank you for continuing this journey and entertaining us all through our lives as a constant source of joy and calmness. <3"
0,"As far as rain goes, it should be possible to use a charm on a beacon to either stop rain completely, or even make it rain constantly, and maybe even make it so it can be doubled to super dry the local area to turn grass into sand, or make thunderstorms constant"
0,"i'm so happy all the hermitcraft people are using the retro ghast textures, sometimes what seems best on paper isn't what's actually best in reality"
0,"Hey Etho! For the next world tour, would you be willing to install Distant Horizons so that we can see the world in a whole new way? I think that it would be pretty cool!"
0,Bad cop from the lego movie makes an apearance in this etho-sode
0,"Hi Etho! I really love your videos, they always make me laugh.

I have a question for you, or for anyone who wants to answer. I‚Äôm wanting to be a gaming YouTuber as well and I was wondering if you have any tips? Or how you even record your videos in the first place üòÖ? I‚Äôm new to using laptops and computers and stuff

Please and thank you, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day üòä"
0,"Can‚Äôt help but always come check on my boy etho. Always a great feeling seeing the content still coming, and still having the same love you always have for the game. Have been watching sense I was a kid now I‚Äôm a father of two. Truly grateful to have grown up watching someone as genuine as you. Hope you are doing well buddy"
2,"Ive been watching this series since highschool, 12 years later and i still get excited!! üòÇ"
0,"Etho, have you seen the Minecraft movie? What did you think?"
0,maybe wind charge off of the ghast and fishing rod them up?
0,Etho! What do you think about Copper Golems and the Happy Ghast? They really brought more life to the base. It feels like Minecraft is starting to focus on adding mobs and tools that make our bases feel more alive‚Äîjust like you mentioned in the Imp & Skizz podcast before. Also i am following you since the beginning of chocolate island my fav YouTuber (:
0,Let play's new seri: TerrafirmaCraft: Hardrocküò¢
0,Never feed them Fire Charges after Midnight!üòÇ
0,this guys a legend
0,Can‚Äôt wait to see etho work with copper golems when they come out!
0,Etho would you consider doing another terraria playthrough. Its been almost 10 years and we miss it!
0,Yes
0,he likes parkour now? gosh he‚Äôs sooooooo obsessed with Joel ü§≠üòÜ
0,"the soul speed sorting is such a wonderful concept, but also hilarious because it is so immensely niche"
0,"The timer for the ghast is long, but if you‚Äôve ever seen ark survival evolved, most Dino‚Äôs take that time and bigger ones take hours. 

 I think it‚Äôs an interesting mechanic to Minecraft. We‚Äôve never had to wait for so long for something. Maybe in the future there will be new ‚Äúcrafting tables‚Äù that will have the same patience/wait mechanic. After all there is more and more metal work to be done now copper is in."
0,Yes
0,"PARKOUR ARC ETHO, ID NEVER THOUGHT ID SEE THE DAY"
0,"Hey etho there is someone else that has the exact same name well kind of he's name is ""ethobot"" can you talk about ethobot?"
0,"Common usage post-aestivation seem to be awake, emerge, arouse from..."
0,Etho with 7 more episodes left are you dreading filming the next world tour?
0,Can you build something specific in redstone for me
0,"I just want to say thank you for still playing and making videos, i literally grew up on your amazing personality. Just wanted to say i appreciate everything you‚Äôve done even when i don‚Äôt watch for a while, your always the guy i come back to when i need. Love you man"
0,31:30 does powdered snow make wind charges shoot out of dispensers perfectly straight like it does for dropping blocks? Or does it block the wind charge?
0,I love your videos Etho I have been watching them ever since I was 5 You are awesome
1,"Wow what an amazing episode, this one was so fun and playful I barely realized the video was over 30 minutes long by the end of it time flew by, and speaking of time flying by, an episode like this is especially nostalgic, because I'm going away to a summer camp today in pennsylvania called camp woodward, and I remember when I was a camper there when I was 13 or 14 around 2013 watching an episode in the man cave where you were working on building the school in the underground village for the villagers, and now today, 12+ years later I'm watching an episode from the same series before I leave to go back to that same camp now as apart of there staff. Crazy how cyclical life can be sometimes. Great episode! Can't wait to continue seeing more, and now this is a good excuse to build a floating base somewhere in your world, kind of like the floating snowflake you already have! As an Idea!"
1,Can you please please give world download of your current world. I just want that dragon tunnel one. The dragon display! Please sir
0,"I think it is an excellent timer for redstone tbh. Minecraft is a game where you rarely just do a single thing for 20 minutes so I don't really mind the wait. I assume the easiest thing will be to have one or a few happy ghasts at each general area where you are building. It is an excellent addition for building, which used to be a pain for bigger structures that require a lot of sneak walking and scaffolding and as a mob it is super charming. I wouldn't mind the ability to speed it up a bit. Maybe feed it a something to get a 10 minute 50-100% speed boost. Still not fast, but convenient for bigger building projects.

Mojang should tweak the movement speed of minecarts, horses etc ^^ I wouldn't mind a more expensive rail that allows a much greater movement speed either."
0,9:58 i appreciate the ur ghast
1,Brother Etho I‚Äôve been watching your series since I was 13 and I just turned 27 on Monday you‚Äôve now been a part of more than half of my life. Thank you üôèüèº
0,"What can ""grow"" within a cycle of the dried ghast timer?"
0,"Etho, I know you have mentioned game dev and other programming concepts before, so I was wondering if you are/were a developer of any sort? If so, what languages do you know well or prefer? Any cool projects you have worked on?"
0,"One of my favourite videos you've made in months, probably in this whole year! I love the messing around episodes where we just see you explore the intricacies of new stuff, it's so great to see your unique brain working like that! As well as seeing your process at the end as well"
0,"I want more boring stuff etho, i want the supid contraptions and building"
0,I hope he learns to inv jam
0,I love rain
0,"You should attach several ghasts in succession with leads, confine them to a space and the player has to get across the space on the ghasts heads. They would randomly fly around in a train."
0,Do potions affect them?
0,Etho teaching me new words about animals! Estivation: prolonged torpor or dormancy of an animal during a hot or dry period.
0,How can normal Ghasts not become dried out in the Nether where there's no water??? üòÜ
0,How crazy would it be if they added a gatling gun to this game
0,"As a kid I really wanted to ride the Ghasts, 14 years later not only did they add it but made them useful and cute. Best update ever."
0,Warms my heart that you‚Äôre still playing and doing this series. I was a young boy when I first started watching your content and now I‚Äôm a grown ass man haha. Keep it up mate!
0,5:36 You can make engine sounds lol
0,Happy ghast is the reason to make another farm...
0,That soul speed boot invention is insanely high IQ
0,"Etho, how do you decide on colour/block pallettes for your builds? I have ALOT of trouble figuring out which blocks I should use, and get unmotivated. I love your block choices! and would love to know your though process!"
1,"man what happend to minecraft, this is so cringe :("
0,Speed potion ????
1,"Hey Etho, I wanted to thank you. About a year ago you read a comment of the day regarding Vintage Story. That same evening I purchased the game. I've been addicted ever since. Thank you so much for reading that comment of the day."
0,How about speed pots for moving them?
0,33:44 etho casually stretching a string and some slime 10 or more times its length in a fraction of a second while complaining that it is to weak
0,"I think the timer for rehydrating them would have been more interesting if they only rehydrated in the rain, instead of in water, and rehydrated in like 2-3 minutes of rain tops. It feels a little more thematic and would be a little random, rather than a hard 20 minutes."
0,"Definitely some cool parkour ideas here, excited to see what else people do with these happy lil ghasts"
0,Yer hilarious! Absorbing the joy. :)
0,How can you not love an Etho happy ghast vid? Right?
0,the ghasts could be used as a gondola if theyre leaded to a mob in a minecart
0,18:39 the name of your pickaxe reminds me of one of the bosses from terraria
8,"This is why I love Etho, he never takes anything at face value. Like, minecraft gave us this mob to : sit on it, fly around with it, and build stuff easier.

What Etho does with it before all of that : Parkour course, sound effects, redstone clock"
0,20 minutes is ok. Gives a sense of achievement and gets away from instant gratification. Games should have more things like that to work towards.
0,is this their april fools snapshot?
0,I like the timer. I think the time requirement keeps you engaged with the game (IMO).
0,Seeing the ‚Äúhave you ever built a redstone contraption then realized you made it too complicated‚Äù comment knowing he was about to turn around to wilson was some crazy nostalgia
0,Always love these videos where you mess around with new features
0,"I'm pretty sure the dried ghast and how it rehydrates is based on a real life type of bacteria called Tardigrade. So to answer your question, personally I would call it rehydration. I think estavation or hibernation implies that it's a deliberate behavior, so in my opinion that doesnt apply."
0,They should add a snowball-fishing rod to speed them up same way you speed up pigs or striders
0,We got etho edging dried ghosts before gta 6
0,"Hey Etho, 

What do your statistics look like in the world? It would be interesting to see after so long
Surely you're holding some records in there!"
0,Thank you for being the greatest Minecraft YouTuber ever Etho. Keep it up.
1,"""Happy ghasts"" are gay af. Dumbest idea Mojang has had since phantoms and nerfing mendfinity bows"
0,^
0,ooh ooh oh oh oh what about happy ghast minecart railcannon for speedy travel
0,"Maybe with these ghasts, etho will finally finish his rooves and cielings"
0,"The only thing I dislike about happy ghasts is that you use water to revive a creature that's native to the nether, where water can't even exist."
0,"Q: How long will it take for Etho to game-ify these--
Etho: Yes.
üòÇ‚ù§

Also, I didn't see one named Bdubs' Mom!

Thanks for the video Etho! ‚ù§"
0,"You know what you could do to transport them faster, you could get a riptide trident and fly with them. The distance you can get is not bad and with rain you can go infinite."
0,shouldnt cut it out of the video because its funny
0,I wish I made more time to be a loyal viewer and comment on every episode. üò¢
0,mama etho *insert maid outfit*
0,"Etho maybe i wasn't fully paying attention, but have you tried fishing rods?"
0,Are there cargo harnesses for the ghast? If so a baggage train seems possible.
1,You can use wind charges + fishing rod to boost off the ghast then bring it up to you
0,I think something with happy ghasts might be a good strategy in the upcoming life series
0,Have you ever considered if the path you chose to walk through life was best? I constantly have doubts about doing the things I do. Just curious
1,Happy Canada Day Etho!
1,"This was actually my first time hearing about aestivation, and it sent me down a bit of an info rabbit hole. I started wondering if there was a term for it when it‚Äôs not seasonally triggered. Turns out, when it's brought on by extreme heat rather than seasonal cycles, it's called facultative aestivation.

From there, I got curious about whether there's a more general term that isn't tied to specific conditions or seasons‚Äîand that led me to torpor. When torpor is triggered by environmental conditions, it‚Äôs called facultative torpor, and when it's part of a seasonal cycle, it‚Äôs known as obligate torpor.

What makes the Happy Ghast unique is that its dormant state doesn‚Äôt end just because the environment changes‚Äîit also needs to be rehydrated. That makes it much more similar to the dormant state of tardigrades (aka water bears), called cryptobiosis. In this state, they lose nearly all their body water (down to about 1%), their metabolism nearly stops, and they can survive that way for years or even decades‚Äîonly returning to life when rehydrated.

Basically, Happy Ghast are just super-sized, floating water bears."
0,10:48 nice hot coals sound for saunas and such
0,"Huh, were there parkour jumps you could only make using momentum from a previous jump before? That's quite cool, but I didn't know it."
0,"Its so good for building! Like suddenly you can go creative mode and look from higher up at your builds and build towers and stuff, i love it."
0,They're going to be really good for detailing large structures and sheer faces
0,19:34 üò¨ strange design etho
0,I love your Ghast names üò≠
0,Etho can you just showcase real quick some spots with vibrant visuals on!
0,Etho please upload more ;(
0,"Hey Etho! Long time fan here I really miss your montages! 
Like the hopper, hopper, dropper, dropper, rofflecopter! 
And never think the episode is too long! I will watch it no matter how long it is! ü§©"
0,"I‚Äôm curious about your thoughts on where Datapacks fall in the Vanilla/Not Vanilla debate these days? Are you a hard no or a soft yes/no?

Reason being: you recently talked about recipes you would like to see Mojang add, and some of those can be added with a simple recipe (Stonecutter to turn Stone or Deepslate into their cobbled variety, for example)"
0,You could say the dried ghasts have become re-invigorated once they're fully hydrated.
0,I wish they'd have made a possibility to convert Ghast in the overworld with snowballs (or something else)   instead of watering a dried ghast (another new block).  Forcing players to do the achievement of bringing ghast to the overworld.   That tamagochi thing might be appealing to the young though.
2,I think the fact you can craft & farm dried ghasts and grow as many dried ghasts into ghastlings as you want at once is worth the timer tradeoff
0,'Rejuvenated' might be the word you're looking for.
0,can you use speed splashpotions on the happy ghasts or on mobs you want to transport while flying?
0,"Etho, would you and the hermits ever consider doing a UHC? Not sure how it would work with how many updates have come out since the old uhc days and not even sure if you guys have the rights to the game mode, but I think it would make for such a fun series again"
0,Etho liking parkour? We are 100% in the recession
1,I wonder what an Etho Satisfactory world would look like
0,parkour?! have u seen parkour civilization?
0,"Early to mid game the Happy Ghast is really opening up overland travel -- my favorite ""mode"" of play right now is to not build a single base, but rather float from town to town levelling up cartographers and raiding Trial Chambers."
0,Etho you should make a moving platform game on Hermitcraft üëåüèª
0,Etho getting super into parkour makes me really excited to see him return to MCC sometime
0,Im curious if the lead also breaks if you already fired the rocket and the lead mid flight. Or how enderpearls or chorus fruit interacts with the new lead system.

0,The  proper term for coming out of Estivation is Emiliosation...
0,you can lead them AFTER you use a rocket and the lead wont break
0,I just time travelled into the past watching that intro omg
0,"Does anyone know what ‚Äúdeferred render distance‚Äù is referring to in the new update? I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúdeferred‚Äù means in this context, is that different from classic render distance? I tried looking it up but I couldn‚Äôt find anything. It has been a little while so maybe someone‚Äôs posted an explanation by now."
0,I wonder if slow fall potions affect the happy ghasts in any significant way. Would be cool if you could hit them with a speed potion and a slow fall potion
0,name one of them appa
0,"I know its a random LP ep but thank you Etho, you bring so much joy to my life and the world. whenever i see you upload a strange sense of calm comes over me and i know that for about half an hour ill be happy. thank you Etho."
0,Ergo please play Vintage Story ‚ù§
0,"Wow, Wilson was a crazy pull. This update was 100% inspired by Etho."
0,You should turn the broken/inefficient slime farm of the man cave to a rare mob merry go round
0,"from what i have noticed in my world, im pretty sure the boats and ghasts getting no height from the slime block launch is number of entities loaded based"
0,Final form: Mama Etho
0,I think the timer is not that big of a deal. Were so caught up with instant gratification that it kind of forces you to step back and be patient. You could set them up near another project you'd be working on and the time would pass the same. I mean think back to when minecraft first came out with how long it took to mine and build things
0,"Hey Zenith, you should ask Etoh to free you from your windows logo prison for the world tour @ 600."
0,Sadly I can only play on my phone and the new update over heats it. So can‚Äôt play Minecraft anymore‚Ä¶ with they would make it so we can turn off all the new features that‚Äôs causing the overheating.
0,"I‚Äôm so glad Etho is still having such a successful YouTube career and that these Let‚Äôs Plays are still garnishing as many views as they are. I recall avidly watching him in my late teen years, I‚Äôm in my mid twenties now, and seeing these uploads always gives me a raging nostalgia and a familiar comfort that I find rarely in my days."
0,"Is it ""ethos lab"" Or 

""Etho slab"""
0,"Did you just casually parkour that? It was also super cool to see you doing experiments on the new features. I miss those. You just have this ""investigator"" air that makes it feel like we are learning secrets. Which is usually true because you tend to use them for unexpected mechanics. I still recall the boat-powered BUD switch.

Thanks for including the launcher outtake, I didn't actually know how to optimize those and I'd rather use a more efficient one even if it is larger. And again it is interesting to see you test these. The whole fun of the game is seeing what odd challenge you can do, so even the armor sorter is valid from that perspective.

I love the noisemakers as well, but in world it's a little dark... ""Oops, no water, better luck next time.""

I am still not sure how I actually feel about the ghasts. They are nice for building, but we already have unhappy ghasts and it doesn't feel like it fits the game, even if it does actually solve a long-unmet need. In hindsight it is weird that building in survival is all-around better but you can't get under a build or place a truly floating block..."
0,I hate the fog so much
0,"Etho, I was just watching BDubs new vid and had an idea. What if you used the happy ghasts to make a ball game,? Can you hit back ghast fires on the new ghast?"
0,Can you use a splash potion of swiftness on them so they are faster?
0,"Great episode, loving the dried ghasts as parkour it's a good idea, and the happy ghasts are so cute, loved all the little names haha. Keep up the great work Etho."
1,19:07 erm Etho??? whats that pattern with the dispensers??
1,You need to show more of your redstone experiments! they are fascinating. just do them quickly if you think people arent interested. They were the best part of this video
1,I wish they would add a magic Whistle (item) of sorts that you could associate with a peaceful mob and it would call them to your position.
4,Dried ghast would make a good cooked squid item. Imagine you have a campfire with a dried ghast on top as if you are grilling it.  They also would make great heads to place on dummies.
0,"these cubes look so bad to me

Especially so many"
0,Love your videos Etho. Watching you learn the new mechanics is very fascinating
0,"As someone who‚Äôs nickname is Marshmello

I am honored to be in the thumbnail of this video"
0,Etho saying that parkour is fun wasnt on my 2025 bingo card.
1,Oh yeah the great one continues I got my snacks tuna tacos
0,7:30 sounds like a pretty good and compact randomizer!
0,I think they would be great for building in the end.
0,Effo
4,Etho making various little contraptions to get different sequences of the dried ghast hydration sound is so joyful. Keep on being full of whimsy my guy
1,"etho, you didn't test them with speed potions"
0,"it's so much fun to watch your test and play with new mechanics in the game! you always manage to explore/examine things from angles that i would've never thought of myself, and it's so fun to see your other interests bleed into it as well, like now with parkour. the joy and playfulness of it all is very infectious :D
it was also really cool to get a look into your creative test world at the end, to see how your brainstorm, develop, and troubleshoot ideas!"
1,"my plan is to hydrate one in the end, after killing the dragon, to do that initial exploration for end cities.  none of the stress and hassle of bridging over the void and end islands, just float around until you find a few elytra."

That said, a ghast raiser probably wouldn't get enough use to justify itself..."
0,"Etho, can you throw a haste potion at ghast to get zoomies?"
0,"Hey Etho :) Im happy that you read your comments, it makes us viewers feel seen.
I think i found a way to make horse and ghast a great combination, you can leash them together in both directions with too leashes. This way they both get dragged behind if you ride the other.
Donkeys seem to have the perfect speed for the leashes not to break. Storage and faster travel, but still nothing OP yet."
0,"The soul speed boots contraption is actually very interesting, I think you should share these more often even if you don‚Äôt use it. 
Could be useful for some people."
0,"Happy ghasts return to their spawn location when they're not near a player. Building a platform at world height and spawning them there, then using an elytra and a lead to pull them to where you need to go, might be a way to transport them pretty easily."
0,Wasn‚Äôt there always fog???
0,Etho my man I‚Äôve been watching since the early don‚Äôt starve days and I beseech thee as to how to keep these silly b****** alive
0,I think the 20 min timer is completely fine. The game should not be balanced around players who did everything they could and coming back only to try some new features. Normal player can do something else while raising the thing on the background.
0,"Been watching science the first time you found clay, back when you had the old intro and everything i remember you calling out every voice crack man it‚Äôs crazy this many years later you‚Äôre still going. Respect.

Ohhh, so that's how you get dried ghasts. So I can get them in my current world, using my stash of gold. They'll be good for looting forest mansions, since the issue there is getting more loot than you can carry. But a ghast caravan carrying chest boats relieves the inventory crunch.

Do speed potions work on the ghasts? ü§î"
0,"Seeing as you can drop block onto it while on it, is the a normal hit box that would allow you to place a block in mid air?"

0,Early game nether becomes safer once more
1,"Etho, I love your curiosity and experimental approach to minecraft. You are a true scientist in this virtual reality. 
If the ghasts have a much larger mass than the player, then it makes sense that slimes and sticky pistons wouldn't move them as far. The same force applied to a player causes less acceleration to a ghast of higher mass. 
This is not how minecraft physics work, just a random thought watching your videos. I agree the ghasts should be more compatible with the other mechanics. I think you're a one of a kind minecrafter and your ideas have a direct impact on the game."
1,"Etho, here's a fun idea: Would you consider doing occasional LP episodes where you work on your Chocolate Island world? You'd keep it in Beta 1.7.3 of course so things dont break, but just do an episode for that world whenever you have an idea for a build that works in that version. I think it would be fun to see that world continue, even if it isn't the primary focus."
0,"I remember when years ago you went mad in that parkour map. Now look at you, loving parkour."
0,Can you use speed splash pots on the happy ghast?
131,"When sea monkeys are dehydrated and then brought back to life by adding water, the process is called ""cryptobiosis."" Specifically, sea monkeys (brine shrimp) enter a state of ""anhydrobiosis,"" a type of cryptobiosis where they lose almost all their water content and enter a dormant state. In this state, their metabolism virtually stops, allowing them to survive extreme conditions like dehydration. When water is reintroduced, they rehydrate and resume normal biological functions, effectively ""coming back to life.""

A cryptobiosis state and an anhydrobiosis state could be accurate terminology to use for Happy Ghasts."

Lately I‚Äôve been watching some of your older Team Canada series, like *Labyrinth of Puzzles!* and Sky Factory 2.5, and I would love to try out my editing skills and craft a few compilation videos from these series. Not just editing down each episode, but trying to show little narrative arcs across multiple episodes in a fun way, for example. I don‚Äôt want to rob you of any ad revenue from people watching your videos, but I assume your older series don‚Äôt get too many views these days?

Surely, they can be to slow for most exploration, but if you can lead them in horses and boats, they can be helpful, especially in more vertical terrain.
But they might be amazing for doing big, tall or floating builds, especially combined with scafolding, slime blocks and honey blocks among other building tools."

1,"I'd love if you'd be able to make air balloons with them, small ones and probably rather niche  but would still be fun to have a small little platform you could use to move several animals on at a time and maybe a double chest or 2 on it.  I want to see more transportation methods in general even if they only have niche use-cases.. I don't like how elytra ruined creativity  for that as you have to make a choice of not using them at all if you want more fun creative ways in your world.

I'm a bit surprised you didn't do more train shenanigans with them given that you usually go for trains in every modded series you do, hooking the leaded ones up to ghasts in carts, maybe have animals attached to the ones trailing after and so on.
Keep being awesome and I'll see you in the next one!"
0,Would it work to splash a speed potion on them?
0,Do speed potions not work?? Was that too dumb of a suggestion to even try?

0,Wow i ain‚Äôt seen Minecraft clouds for years
0,Correct me if I'm wrong but cant you just fly the ghast up high and elytra off without needing a launcher or anything?

0,"Perhaps a 20 minute timer that requires interaction every 2-4 minutes. This can be automated with redstone etc but if the player does the interaction the happyghast gets a speed bonus. You could also give it other stat boosts, such as more hearts, etc. So the more you engage with the development of your pet, the better pet it is."

Guess i need my mod for that still..."
0,"What about moving it while it touches ice, or while you're influenced by dolphin's grace in some way, or with you in an ice boat and it's tethered to you"
0,"My niche complaint for the ghast is how it was included in piglin bartering. There's a niche nether only playstyle that I really enjoy, but it's very tightly tied to the bartering system. The dried ghast is essentially a non-item in bartering without access to water. Wish you could break them for ghast tears. Very niche, but that's what stood out to me."
1,"I had to pause the video to comment on this. I know youtubers, and a good number of non-youtubers too, NEVER want it to rain in their worlds and loathe the change to the rain timer... but as someone who hates Phantoms and loves atmosphere, I ALWAYS hated that sleeping through nights meant I never got to see rain ever. I sincerely hope they come up with some other method of making rain stop, or preventing it, that _isn't_ just sleeping. Maybe sleeping with a new potion effect resets the timer? Altering weather DOES seem like the domain of magic. You could rig your bed with redstone to automatically splash potion you whenever you lay down to sleep, or maybe they could add that potion effect to beacons and have a general no-rain zone around your base."

0,Etho maybe try a wind burst I or II book instead of III on the ghast
0,I winced when he said 15 years
0,"I‚Äôm fine with the timer, 20 mins Might be too long, especially without interaction/risk of death if you wander off, but generally i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with not having instant gratification in survival, thats what creative is for."
0,Could you do a self-building bubble column so you don't need the tower
2,"21:14 I think it‚Äôs the same as horses, the wind charges will move a mob a lot. But not if there‚Äôs a rider on it."
1,"I HATE the drop system.

Why does the patch version number bump for updates that add FEATURES, it should be the minir version that bumps, while patches should be for just bug fixes and patches.

Also feel much less hyped for releases since they add so little and since snapshots are so mainstream now, mostly everything is already known and spoiled. there's no mystery.

Back in the day, you had secrets, little Easter eggs and such to discover, find, share with other players. Nowadays, everything is overdesigned to ""perfection"" in the eyes of Mojang, use them as designed.

Back in the day we could invent curious little unintended behaviors with the new blocks they gave us. New blocks and mobs lack depth or complexity.

I miss the golden days."
2,‚ÄúI‚Äôm determined to find something stupid we can do‚Äù YES that‚Äôs our etho
0,I wonder if a happy Ghast lift in your base would make a good decorative feature?|
0,"Happy ghasts as far as I know have their ""center"" at the bottom of their hitbox, same as almost all other entities, with exceptions being things like paintings, item frames, shulkers if they are extended down and for some reason wind charges. I would assume that the reason why wind charges didn't launch them a lot was that they try to pathfind to a specific position and as soon as they cross that height, they try to go down with their own ai which massively slows them down. And when you are sitting on them, it's interaction between server and client that's not working properly."
0,"Hey Etho, have you tried using TNT cannons to launch the Happy Ghasts? They seem to affect alll mobs the same way, unlike the wind charges, so maybe you'll have more luck with them? Kepp posting amazing vids, I've always believed you're one the of technical Minecraft GOATs."
0,You can use the sad gast timer for Wilson?
0,7:51 has to be horn of the month
2,I imagine happy ghasts are the perfect delivery system for anvil kills
0,Oh god i really love how looks when its raining(even though i know u hate it)!! These little ghasts are so adorable! Great video Etho!
0,Not Etho edging the dried ghasts üòÇ
0,"I love the way you experiment with new features when they're released. You can get a small vertical boost on the ghast by hooking it with a fishing rod, jumping, and reeling it in midair. Not sure how practical it is, but it may be worth a look."
0,Maybe with the punch bow you can fly these things around faster?
0,"Thew dried ghast timer is interesting. It's a fixed 250 second timer that only starts with a random tick. Once that timer is over, the block advances to the next (or previous) stage or spawns the ghastling mob. If there's ever a need for ""I need at least 4 minutes, but random and it should be around roughly 5 minutes"", this is it. :)"

0,Etho! Is there anything you would have expected to be in the game by now that still hasn't been added?
0,"Interesting, the happy ghast's very boat-like slime block interaction and being an entity that can take multiple passengers makes me wonder if maybe the happy ghast's code is a highly modified boat"
0,"commenting on the small rain rant at around 17:00, i personally think it was a positive change.
rain was too uncommon before they made sleeping not reset the timer, i understand it's horrible for content creation due to bitrate and similar issues, but i think this way is unfortunately better for most players. (myself included. i love rain. rain vibes so cozy so comfy)

however, i think mojang could easily create a ""best of both worlds"" scenario by just letting players sleep away rain as well. we can already sleep to skip thunderstorms, what's stopping us from sleeping in rain? plus, rain lowers the sky light level, so it's technically a hazard similar to night. even ignoring the content creator woes, i think it'd be positive to allow skipping it overall."
1,I'm so thankful! I get so happy adding an Etho video to my watchlist. üòä
2,Hey Etho when is the next world tour? It‚Äôs been a while since you had and your world has changed a lot since then. Love your videos keep up the good work!
0,"The dried ghast sounds remind me of metroid for nes/snes.

Perhaps ghast hydration is similar to rehydrating tardigrades. Very loose thought, lol."
0,Would you ever consider getting a cat or pet?
0,I‚Äôve been so starved etho content I watch any hermit video with etho in the thumbnail and just fast forward to when etho comes in. I watch as many stream clips of etho interacting with the streaming hermit as I can find
0,"lol you don't have many ghast tears left in Hermitcraft either, someone knicked them for pranks XD"
0,"If you hate the rain so much, why not just turn off the weather cycle?"
0,i love how they keep adding fun stuff to minecraft. like this ghast update is the sort of stuff people would mod into their games 10 years ago that felt too out there/complex for the actual game to ever actually implement
0,"Oh my gosh, pulling the ghast around while riding a horse looks like so much fun.  I have to do it now.  Their cry sounds like a cat.
Edit:  the horse on the ghast!üòÆ"

0,"""Somebody That I Used To Know"" is my favorite song by Ghostye."
0,parkour on dried ghast is crazy
9,"One thing I really like about them is that they feel like a midpoint/smoothing-of-the-ramp between pre-end city travel and Elytras. Like, before this it was ""You are totally earthbound, oh you beat the ender dragon? Now you can fly anywhere forever!"" Now you get to the nether and you get _some_ aerial travel. It's slow and niche but it's a nice smooth curve to reach the unbound freedom of the elytra"
0,I'm going on vacation for 3 weeks. All I wanted was to leave on an Etho episode!
0,Pretty Gassy episode üëå
1,"Making a separate comment here. If this gets selected for comment of the day!

Hey etho. I've been going through some tough times as of recent. What would you do to keep your mind occupied and how do you deal with it? I know this is a heavy topic but would like to hear some advice"
2,"i just rewatch etho deck out 2 runs
and its funny seeing etho go from disliking parkour to lovin it"
0,"Etho you talked about how parkour is one of your favorite things in Minecraft and I am curious if you have ever looked into the mc parkour scene? There's a lot of cool people doing super advanced stuff, but its mostly on 1.8.9. Look into Pandora's box"
0,With the new happy ghast parkour you can make new levels on frogger etho!
0,Etho experimenting on babies should not come as a surprise at this point
0,"I think they should make the ghasts accelerate super slowly up to a decent speed, so that it‚Äôs still not op for transportation but is at least viable to go on a trip with some buddies"
0,"etho, instead of hating the rain; embrace the rain! i suggest wearing gold boots when it rains cause they look like those yellow rain boots that way it feels more special üòä maybe even name them the new puddle stompers lol"
0,I agree at least like almost running speed. They are slower than walking speed
0,7:51 i need this as a horn pls cub
0,"Hey Etho, have you heard of and/or tried the game Vintage Story? Kinda looks like Terrafirmacraft but in it's own game. I heard lots of good things about it, I would be carious of your take on it. 

As always love the videos, thanks!"
0,"The 20 min isn‚Äôt really much of a blockade for the ghast to be honest, if you need them for building just set them up before you get to the underside of a build right? Like if you are working on a floating island set them up in some water and by the time you are done with the top of the island your ghast will long have rehydrated"
0,imagine keeping six dead babies under your fireplace
0,"you have inspired me to name my ghasts ""saorin"" and ""flyin"""
0,Awww man he didn‚Äôt do the boat thing?? Unfortunate. And etho likes parkour now?!? I never thought I‚Äôd see the day! Maybe he will get around to pvp too some day
0,"I don't think the idea of trying to take care of the dried ghast is a good idea solely for the reason that there is no immediate feedback (or even just knowledge) of that mechanic's function. You could argue interacting them with items is a form of feedback, but it would be unclear what item would have to be interacted with in order for it to work."
0,Unfortunate design choice etho‚Ä¶.. 19:14
0,"Cool, so, ""aestivation."" I guess that's a word. Thanks, Etho!!"
0,"Hey Etho, have you thought about starting up a new terrafirmacraft series? Its already been five years since the last one lol"
2,"Etho.. I‚Äôve been watching you since I was a freshman in high school (2012) and now i watch you as a nightly routine with my 5yr old daughter. 

Every evening she asks ‚Äúcan we watch Minecraft? Can we watch etho?‚Äù We‚Äôve watched so many different series together, including a lot of the old ones. It‚Äôs been cool rewatching those and reminiscing and also sharing the experience with my little one. 

Generational fanbase over here ü´∂üèºthanks for being amazing ü´∂üèº"
0,"Etho dropping the word estivation on us, okay sir! I didn‚Äôt know you were like that!"
0,I just want to have a ghastling forever tbh
0,Apologizing to the horse as he took flight had me cracking up!
0,Have you tried using a fishing rod on the ghasts to pull them up?
0,"with the 20 minute timer, I think the timer makes the ghasts feel less replaceable. like ""Oh, don't worry I've got tonnes of them on me RIGHT NOW, in my enderchest."""
0,"I would probably call a happy ghast 'hatching' as rejuvenation. Meaning to revert to a youthful state, which I think is appropriate for what's happening to the poor guys."
0,33:16 i would have like to seen how you separated them. i made my own and it took weeks to figure out. also its very big and requires arrows to work :/ (this is before the Allay)
0,I can't believe I've been watching etho for 13 years. Insane. TV shows can't hold my attention for that long
1,"sounds like happy ghasts sounds are derived from cat noises, just like normal ghasts."
0,"It's kinda refreshing to see you try and engineer out solutions and understand how mob mechanics work without checking all the patch notes and keeping up with the ""tech demo"" type videos that explain everything. 
An example I wanted to point out is how the Ghast AI works when you are on top of its solid head and when you lead it. Their movement AI changes so that it's a reliable platform that you can jump around on. That's what's messing with your project to drag ghasts perpetually upwards. Maybe try something with fishing rods and leads to freeze their AI to pull them with another entity?

IIRC, the leads breaking is based on velocity at the end of its range. So, if you're walking and a lead on a boat is stuck on a block, it can actually stay connected for a long distance and increase tension to have a sling effect."
0,21:00 could test a slime piston wind charge launcher or water stream to condence them into a a space if they don't interact off one another that way can focus the muddle of ghast to see if works that way ( would semi be like an end pearl launcher in concept just with multiple wind charges for the slime piston one if they don't get activated from the collision )
8,It's wild to come back to this series after taking like a 10 year break from Minecraft content and seeing parts of the base are still the same. It makes it feel so easy to jump back in after all this time.
0,What if u toss a speed potion on the ghast? XD 15:30
0,etho plays modded Minecraft #2 ep 13
0,"""I will find something stupid to do with these""
Etho says as 3 are chained together dragging each other around"
0,seeing the ghast in the water bubble column made me think of an idea of an elevator..
0,Surprised Etho didn't immediately think to see if speed potions worked on them for flying
0,What about happy ghast with a lead going to pig or a villager that's in a minecart. So you have the cat moving fast along the rails and it'll pull the ghast to each stop.
0,"Etho when are you going to do
something about the wiener building"
0,I think fog is just there to give an illusion of smoooooth gameplay
0,"Can't you just use the ghast to fly up, then hop off an lead them with an elytra?"
0,"Hey Etho
Was waiting for you to do this episode and it was as wonderful as I thought it would be. I have always enjoyed watching you have fun with the new updates. Now for the Redstone flying machine question. Is there away to make a flying machine with a fireworks dispenser attached to it? I really would love to use such a machine in a fireworks display. Skizzlecraft Halloween roller-coaster upgrade is still coming along slowing but I am working on a 4th of July fireworks display."
1,15:35 dude i remember you making several floating islands way back when on modded mc. Jet packs were what gave you the idea i think and it turned out it was still a struggle?
0,I think etho has been playing since alpha 1.1.0?
0,Can they survive in the end thougg
0,"Hey Etho! long time follower, since the old chocolate island , tnt firework show days! My birthday is in less than one hour and seeing you posted a new episode is a perfect surprise! Thank you so much for over a decade of entertainment, fun, and shenanigans."
0,I think it called arousal or possibly awakening when they come out of aestivation (estivation for Americans.) Pretty cool stuff! Some animals (and even some plants) do some pretty amazing things.
0,Etho loving parkour is breaking news!
0,"Thank you for the video, Etho!"
0,Entertaining video as always.
0,"I find it ironic how you have an insane ghast tear farm on hermitcraft which sponsored X's entire ""ghast-lighting"" prank, yet apparently have no such thing on your own survival forever world so that you had to rely on bartering to get what you needed, haha

Also I think it was X who just said that people have been trying to figure out how your brain works for the last 15 years, and this episode was a hilariously timed example.  Yeah, that new mob that we can fly on and build with?  Listen to these crazy sounds they make when we hydrate them in succession!  Let's see if we can turn him into a clock!  Is ghast parkour more difficult?  How about the parkour challenges we can make after they're full grown and rolling around in minecarts?  Can I land on one with a horse, lead him, and then jump up and drag him into the upper atmosphere?   Can I use windcharges to launch him into space?

You may call this a ""goof around episode"", but I think these are the best ones, haha ü§£"
0,"etho, did you watch the minecraft movie? What did you think? -JL"
0,My brother and I grew up watching your videos and still talk about you often. This is awesome
1,Im glad you showed your soul speed boots sorter. I would have never thought about armor stands moving faster on soul sand with them and using that as a way of sorting - I think it is neat
2,"Ethos happy ghast names-

Soarin
Marshmello
Little Dude
Ariella (my best guess on spelling)
Puffball
I am Cow
Ur-Ghast
Somebody I Used To Know
Aether
Tranquil
Atmocube"
1,A good solution to the speed thing is to simply add the ability to enchant the saddle (could be cool a function to do to the existing addles as well)
0,ETHO YOU CAN'T MAKE THE JUMP PAD THAT SHAPE
1,definitely the weirdest minecraft update to me
0,"I don't care for the new fog effect. Maybe it'll grow on me with time, but it just makes me feel like my screen is dirty."
0,One great advantage of rain; it heals your Happy Ghast
0,That fog is disgusting.
3,Thank you ethoslab. Today is my grandmothers birthday (may she RiP) and just had to bury my grandfather last week. You bring not only joy to me but also some sanity to my life. Thank you for taking your time out of your day to record and talk for us. You are the best
0,7:42 Etho Mom arc
0,"OOOOH, I just had a great idea with the bubble column and happy ghast: proper elevators! Since you can stand on the happy ghast, you could hide a bubble column in a corner of an elevator shaft and use the happy ghast as a platform to stand on, moved up and down by the bubble column and restrained by blocks. It might be a great way to revamp some of the old broken elevators in your world (like the slime block horse elevator), and they might even be good for vertically moving mobs that way."
0,"Hey Etho, does this update mean we'll now get a log section in Ravager Rush, now that it would likely be doable with these happy ghasts?"
0,Ghast Elavator
0,I‚Äôm wondering if he tried doing the air boost jumps holding the snowballs
0,Ur-Ghast is a great pull for a name
0,"The release schedule isn't fast, you're just _that_ slow my guy."
0,hey etho just wanted to say that i have had a very rough day (flight got delayed then cancelled) so this video is perfect timing. thank you for being in my life for almost a decade now and consistently cheering me up.
0,27:20 Etho has some good constructive criticism at about here.
0,"The goof around episode feels _SO_ classic Etho, I love it! More episodes like this interspersed with the usual would be great."
0,"A few things you could try, if you haven't already:
- Flying and hitting yourself with a punch bow (if that still works) instead of using rockets
- Flying in the rain with a riptide trident
- Some sort of TNT launcher for you and the ghast? (if it's possible to minimize damage to the ghast)"
1,"Etho, the timing on this was pretty crazy. I haven't played minecraft in months, and today my sister and I played for the first time together in a while. We found dried ghasts in the nether, and the moment we hydrated them you posted this video! I was amazed at the timing :D"
0,"the fact I'm 23 watching a new upload from you, i remember when i was 16 watching your vids daily truly apart of my gaming childhood is crazy, mind blowing. i thank you for always keeping my mind off of the real world . thank you etho<3"
0,"Okay, you should make a parkour training course in your world, maybe with some fun redstone components! I think it would be super fun for people to play around with in world downloads, and might be a really fun and unique project for you to work on."
0,I kind of wish that the Ghasts didn‚Äôt decline in their dried forms. Having the different textures feels like it would be great for building
0,"Just out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on the Minecraft movie? Especially now that its influence has leaked into the game itself with Lava Chicken. I'm personally torn between being disappointed that brainrot culture so successfully intermingled with the Minecraft community, and not really caring about people goofing off and having their fun."
0,"You know, I know you've already addressed this before but will you ever consider starting a new world? I mean this one is fantastic and nostalgic and has an almost legendary status, but I feel like the game has become so different now from when it started and all of the old builds and nostalgia are almost like a burden? Like, I'm curious to see what a fully new start Etho LP world would look like."
0,Wait is ur-ghast an mtg reference?
0,Wait! The boot sorting was so smart and cool!!! I would totally build that in my world!
0,Camels should have been like three double chest of inventory
0,"Etho's LP update episodes when its like he's playing around with a new toy are so important to me, I love these episodes"
0,Im not a fan of the fog
0,The fog makes it look like bedrock edition
1,Etho panning to Wilson when asked about over-complicating a redstone project sent me.
0,"Etho ya okay man? Parkour   <3R? Pretty sure I've watched all of your episodes since chocolate island ep 11, and you have never said that hahaha! My second question for COTD {comment of the day} is as follows: are you continuing of your dad's green house?  (forgot what you said to tag at the end of the library episode for the first COTD) I hope you are. Thank you kindly for everything"
0,YES AETHER SHOUT OUT PLEASE INCLUDE IT IN YOUR MODDED SERIES I BEG OF YOUUUUUUU
1,this episode made me realise that Etho is actually so good at parkour
1,"4:30 Etho, please tell me you have seen Parkour Civilization. That would just be too dang funny."
0,There are elytra for flying fast. Ghasts seem perfect for floating which hasn't really been possible before.
0,you never go horse to ghast
0,"I may be leaving this comment prematurely, but what about slow fall and jump boost on the horse while you're on it and on the ghast?"
6,8:11 i can't believe i learned a new English vocabulary from ETHO'S minecraft lets play video
0,Regarding the 20 minute timer I instantly thought of Rhyniognatha cravings in Ark where you increase the taming bonus by feeding ‚Äòrare‚Äô items. The same could be applied here with some hard to find/craft items.
0,"You should've said ""I'm gonna be a dad"" lol"
0,"I wonder if the old punch bow elytra method works with the leads, could be a kinda cool way to bring back an older mechanic like that"
0,"It would honestly be less annoying if it were longer. 20 minutes is just short enough that you can't leave it and do something else. They should make it longer, and make the ghast invulnerable and immobile until it sees a player the first time so you don't have to worry about it disappearing. Set it and forget it. Also make it track its starting tick so you can leave the chunks and still have it progress."
0,use the air elevator on the side of a steep cliff no?
1,Etho Happy Clock
0,I wonder how effective fly up high on the ghasts and then towing them while gliding with elytra would be.
0,"With how much work is put into the baby ghast AI I'd like if you could make them stay as a baby! The speed being a little slower than sprinting (much slower than sprint jumping) is quite upsetting as well, they should get a sprint option like camels do! It's a bit annoying how they can clearly fly several times faster when they're not being ridden (even when carrying something heavy)"
0,"I love how when the update came out, people were crying about how sad and cute they looked (wiped their tears as they farm villagers), but etho's first thought was to jump on them"
0,16:35 heck yes art deco
0,I want a permanent baby ghast
0,"16:12 Acceleration to a maximum speed would be nice for the happy ghast.
Move at pace when in transit long-distance, but move finely when building."
0,TENNISSS!!!
0,Nether portals to move happy ghast up? Can it fly through a portal like a boat?
1,"Etho, 
I noticed the towers looked similar to the travel tubes from Futurama. I wonder how quick you could travel using the wind charges and blue ice surrounded by glass or glass panes."
0,"For the last mace and ghast combo you tried, maybe attempt to hit it from the side so you dont go far enough to break the lead?"
82,"Seriously, it's crazy how innovative Etho gets with problem solving in this game, like I've never seen ANYTHING even resembling his boots sorting system at 32:06 and it's just a ""uh, why bother"" project for him. I really like when he shows these, because I feel like a lot of people can get inspired from these, and maybe use these sorts of mechanics in the design for some other creative thing!"
5,24:15 he says sorry to the horse but not to the stepping and experimenting done on the baby ghast... interesting... noted
0,a spitty ghast setup with ghasts being dragged around like balloons could be really fun. I wonder if they're attached to a mob in a minecart that is bounced by a piston if they disconnect the lead
0,"The takeaway from this episode, for me, is that wind charges need buffing to greater utility."
0,Ghast torture deviceüòÇ
0,"I think the mob is stupid, the end."
0,"i love the faster updates, purely because they force etho to put out a goofaround LP episode. the more etho videos we get, the better!"
0,"Love how he ""voices concern"" about the 20 minutes dry ghast thing, cause he should definitely then try ark ü§£"
0,omg it looks like old console minecraft
1,Stunningly good feature out of nowhere that‚Äôs great
0,"Dont think of it as just ""for underside building"" think of it as ""An Mobile Infinite Scaffolding"" that DOES NOT require additional ""supports"" every like 6-7 blocks. 

Plus, its a legit, all be it insanely slow, 100% reliable way of transporting mobs around your world thanks to the new lead mechanics. Gone are the days of trial and error trying to transport mobs via elytra and lead, sure once you figured it out or pillared high enough to glide home it was super fast but never reliable... now we have reliability with the Happy Ghast at the cost of speed... personally id love to see them move faster by default but when leads are attached they slow down to the crawl they are now. Maybe like basic sprinting speed without jump spam... mediocre donkey/horse speed, heck id settle for saddled pig speed or strider speed, i think those two are even faster than the Happy Ghast."
0,I'm not a fan of the happy ghast. It's the first time Minecraft released an update i genuinely dislike. Have there been any updates you genuinely disliked?
0,"i like the idea of having to take care of them during the 20 minute timer. to expand on that if you dont provide the care they want they shouldnt just go back a stage but instead grow up to be a normal, angry ghast lol. like uhoh you were a bad parent and now your child is running amok"
0,I wonder what it would like to use a tnt launcher while riding the happy ghast
0,Minecraft Happy Ghast Kaizo parkour.
0,Hey etho maybe I misunderstood the videos I watcehd but to my understanding the dried ghasts have an exact tick time between changes. The video I saw said exactly 5 minutes between them making a perfect clock for long term things. Could you try looking into this aspect of the dried ghast to see how it helps with your Redstone builds?
0,33:12 33:20
0,"25:20 ok Etho, time to rebuild ravager rush with proper Log platforms now."
0,Any special plans for episode 600? New world tour?
0,I stopped watching a while ago he seems more confident and animated now still good tho just was a shock lol
0,"Kinda wish Etho played more games besides Minecraft, maybe some Factorio or a reboot of Terraria is EZ. 
Seeing that I haven't liked the direction Minecraft has been going, bit Etho is still one of the first and favourite youtubers I watched."
1,"Hi Etho, hope this reaches you well. I've been watching your videos for nearly 14 years, a majority of my life, and I cannot describe how big of an inspiration you've been. I'm in my late 20's now and beginning a career as a university lecturer teaching game design and 3D modelling. I don't think I would be here without your videos and I just wanted to say how awesome that is. I hope I can be as much of an inspiration to my students as you've been to me.


Also, do you still hate onions? I still hate onions."
0,"i always love a ""tinkering with new features"" episode! you always think of things that i would never have come up with."
0,How do ghasts keep momentum in minecarts? Remember those spinning tnt minecart loops from the life series? That ghast would be a fast moving platform if it keeps momentum in a cart
0,"Cubfan135 found something very interesting about the Happy Ghast while using one to detail his bases wall on the HC server.
Get this... While building off their back, changing things out, some blocks fell on /very close to the Happy Ghast but ""too far away"" from Cub to be picked up... then he mounted up again and BLAM all those nearby items got vacuumed up as if Cubs pickup radius was 4x as large... VERY interesting mechanic, no clue how it would be useful outside of its obviously intended purpose of building... but i know someone will find some interesting way to utilize that mechanic."
0,"I'm thinking maybe something can be done with attaching to a parrot on your shoulder, but I forgot the conditions for them to stay on you..."
0,name one bdubs mom
0,Horse + happy ghast is a really cool combo. You get the speed of the horse and if there's a river or something you can bring the horse on the ghast to get over
0,Frogger season 3 with ghast moving platforms maybe???
0,5:09 oh damn he really has been liking parkour!!
0,"I don't think it makes sense to use shears to remove leads, like why can't you just remove it by hand?? Or is it only when connecting to ghosts?"
0,"Etho this makes me wonder an important question, what is your updated opinions on onions? I recall you hated them in Cube World, what about now?

It‚Äôs been so long that I hated them back then too, now I can‚Äôt get enough of them lol. I put them on most meats and salads."
0,"Etho, you forgot about how saddles are craftable now. For literal years a point was made that they wouldn't be, but Mojang changed their minds. Also I was really hoping dried ghasts wouldn't be craftable originally. Knowing you need things from the Nether to make one though has made me decide it's fine. You should try to seek out a real one eventually though, just for fun."
0,I love how much fun you had in this episode. I haven‚Äôt heard you this excited for years. Just having fun goofing off is why I fell in love with this channel years ago.
1,The rapid updates are fun unless you play on a large server and have to wait for Paper and the admin tools to update.
0,"I know you have talked about liking platformers before, but you really enjoying parkour in Minecraft is not something I expected.

I shouldn't be surprised because you also spent years and years conditioning yourself to become a better builder, and look at you now!"
0,Hey etho why dont u use the gamerule or commands for the rain? It doesnt really affect gameplay and spending your time waiting out of principle seems wasteful
0,Etho loving parkour sounds so weird

1,Ayyy Ur-Ghast callback.
0,Etho... happiness takes time.
0,"The whole ghast thing is neat and all, but i feel like a lot of the changes made with their release is another example of mojang making changes to the game in the sense of ""How you Should play"". Instead of ""How you can play"""
0,"Most players: Can't wait to fly around on these things!

Etho: yea so the baby actually has a really interesting hitbox, could have some useful applications...

Anyway since you asked I think the happy ghasts are baffling from a lore perspective, but it's neat that you can build upside down more easily now."

0,What would happen of you launched a minecart while the ghast is inside?
0,"Oohh, I think your idea with the ghast interactive would be cool! It makes me think of Tamagotchis, but instead of getting a bad tama, it just loses its progress. Maybe if you take better care of it, it will fly faster and if you ignore it, it will refuse to move ahahaha!"
0,etho the armor stand sorter is a 10/10 i would have loved to see it in earlier videos

Etho!! You completely forgot!
But man, those ghasts were so much fun to see, amazing episode !"
0,one way to make ghasts follow you is leashing them to an allay
0,"Honestly the happy ghast FEELS like a mod. Im not saying that as even a good or a bad thing, but of all the features this one just feels the most like what youd see in a mod. Its a little hard to describe but everything from the progression to just how different things are executed...if you uploaded this feature as a mod review itd be totally indistinguishable"
0,"Sometimes I'm less excited about features than seeing what Etho can do with them, happy ghasts is definitely high on that list. 

I agree with the elytra making all transportation irrelevant outside of ice boats but what makes them great is speeding up the game. I think Minecraft needs more late game advances that do that. I'd love something that makes building faster. Please please please. Survival Minecraft penalizes builders too harshly for the time vs reward investment. Let us build!"
1,"As someone who doesn't like parkour, I really want to know what got you into parkour after 15 years. What is it that you've discovered that made you give it another go?"

1,The armour stand campfire thing you showed just solved Tango's latest problem with Hungry Hermits
0,Those new ghatsts are so cute! I'd love a happy ghast fueled hot air balloon lol
1,Can you imagine waking up and you‚Äôre a happy ghast in Etho‚Äôs Let‚Äôs Play.
0,"i honestly think happy ghasts are... fine enough for a 3 month update. in my personal opinion, it shoulda been a longer time between updates to let the features get more polished (and potentially be more plentiful) considering we're already getting a 1.21.7 soon because of some critical oversights, AND they're adding the bedrock exclusive painting to java *and a new music disc*
it really feels to me like they're unorganized and rushing these 3 month updates, they should be given more time to work and polish these things- and maybe a bit more focus could be nice too? like why randomly changing how splash potions work in this update? or adding the locator bar? or adding ""/dialog"" (which i personally find kinda insulting considering how they specifically Don't want it to be used as custom menus... but we don't really have anything that can be used as custom menus in its stead?)? the lead changes make sense considering the happy ghast, but that and the saddle/lead shearing changes are some of the only thematically relevant things in this update!!!
also, the dried ghast should have a model for when it's not supported by a block, it should look like it's dangling in the air"
0,"Hey etho, I was curious if there was any chance to  revisit the end portal base? I know it's been kinda of a mess for awhile but I think it'd be cool if you figured out something cool to design there or make nicer there?"
0,you can feed them snowballs to grow faster
0,"Maybe they need to add chains to the game. Chains could work like leads, but have a much stronger connection. Bonus is we can use them to make chainmail."
1,"Another great episode, Mama Etho! üòÇ I love when you experiment with updates. 
I'm disappointed in Mojang for making the happy ghasts craftable now. I liked it better when they had to be found. Made them more interesting and unique."

0,THE FOG ISN'T MY IMAGINATION?! I swear I thought I was going crazy!
0,Reanimated?
1,The wind charge tower at the end reminds me of the Carnival Hammer minigame. And maybe a Floating haunted mansion of some kind would be a cool build. All the sounds incorporated.
0,"I wonder if the solution to moving ghasts around is to just set up a spawning station at each work site, maybe next to each enderporter. It seems like it‚Äôs not too much an issue to get lots of babies, and transporting those would be a breeze."

0,"Since you can hang a horse, couldn't you also hang a donkey and have a portable chest? Most importantly, a portable chest you can fill with shulkers, in addition to your inventory? Or, next level, a donkey in a chest boat allowing for a full double chest of shulkers?

Cause if you are already flying a ghast over, might as well save a trip or 2 having a large inventory underneath."
3,"""Happy"" for the new upload! 
I tried parkour it was pain and sadness, i finished the dailies in mcci yesterday... but never give me gap jumping from trapdoor to chains from the other day ;__; i raged quit lol
Baby ghast jumps might be my next pain..."
1,"Hey ergo, I found that using a riptide trident to get a boost with elytra while leading mobs works well, you just can‚Äôt get too much vertical acceleration at first so you sort of have to start looking horizontally then pitch up."
0,what if you used potions on the ghasts? like levitating or jump boost
0,"Hi Etho, good episode! I like the ones which are just messing around and experimenting. I wonder what speed potions are like with the Happy Ghasts? Also what if you swim along a dolphin highway while leading one? Or an ice road, can you put them in boats? Lots of questions! I might need to do some experimenting too! :D Anyways hope you're well, thank you for the upload ‚ù§"

0,no speed potion test? I'm a little surprised!
0,Im curious how the happy ghast hitbox works when it's named Dinnerbone/Grumm
0,"Hey Etho, I have a question about your let's play. Unless you've changed it up, I was wandering why you play it fully vanilla without mods which in my view only add to the game, and make it more convenient. Such as Sodium/Optifine, tweakeroo, that shulkerbox mod etc., and turn off enderman griefing with a datapack. Most obstacles in the game, like having the risk of being blown up by creepers, having to gather resources etc., as annoying as it can be add something to the game, but to me things like enderman griefing and having to place and look into your shoulker boxes take away from it for me. So I was curious as to why you do it your way on the lets play."
0,Can they be Potion‚Äôd for more speed? ü§î or an invisible ghast‚Ä¶..?
0,Does Etho melt if he gets rained on?
0,What if you leashed it to a fence stood on top not mounted and then had the wind charges fire? You could use it like an elevator that carries you up and jump off of  and the ghst would return to the fence?
0,Do the classic TNT launcher work on the ghast? like a 3x3 with water surrounded by Dispensers with pistons. It might kill them? but a balance of the amount of tnt will probably work?
0,Your a momma now!
0,"27:00 for the managing aspect, maybe tie that into the happy ghast's stats, have 3 ways of upkeep, one for health, one for vertical speed, one for horizontal speed. Sure, it could be min-maxed, but it would be engaging. 

Since they cant be bred like horses, having the normal happy ghast with unchanged stats (the one in the video) be a result of just a timer and unchanged stats after unpetrifying, it could be neat"

14,"8:01 About 'Hatching' or 'Rehydrating' not being quite the right word. I remember something about Tardigrades being able to survive for an impressively long time without water, the state their body goes into when they 'dry out' had a name that might be fitting for what happens to the Dried Ghasts!

Edit: i was able to find the video i heard about this from, it would be like saying the Dried Ghast has come out of it's tun state! (ref. TED-Ed Meet the tardigrade, the toughest animal on Earth - Thomas Boothby)"

I love that you gave them all names ü•∞"
0,So glad etho isn‚Äôt sick anymore!
0,"Minecraft was never a game that implemented minigames to any of the mechanics (except for maybe fishing) and the people seem to very much like that. I think it might be because some minigames can become stale over time (imagine pressing the same buttons for the 100th time in a row), and the focus lies more on using the time however you like. That's why I think not adding more mechanics to the Ghast growing up is a good thing despite there being opportunities to add a funny minigame. But maybe there's a way to make it more exciting without being to monotonous."
1,"""I like that cry sound they make"" Etho villain arc starts now."
0,there should be a way to freeze the timer so u  can have the different faces and be able to silk touch them for decorations

Where the random tick internal (If random) could be used to change a state. I don't know if it would be super useful, but, it felt like one of those odder methods of doing redstone you do once in a while."

0,31:24: is it the velocity of having the ghast on the lead causing you to not make it? Too fast lead thinks it‚Äôs a rocket?

0,"10:48 You could use it for an arid place, or possibly a cliffside to resemble the sound of rocks and pebbles cascading down."
0,How about reanimated?
0,I checked over 100 bone structures in the Nether without finding one. In the end i just crafted it with the tears i got whilst killing all the ghasts in the nether whilst looking =D
20,"The 20 minute rehydration + baby phases worked well on me. I spent a whole weekend fighting ghasts and dying for those tears, left one alone to rehydrate and it killed itself somehow, then babysat the next one for the full 20 minutes. I spent the 20 minutes after it successfully rehydrated jumping around and celebrating while admiring how cute it was. Psychological manipulation works!"
0,Awesome episode. Would love to see you play the Aether II mod!
0,I was kinda disappointed that this update was so amall although i do like the happy ghasrs a lot theyre a cool addition! Although i think there was probably a better way to do the saddles than to have 16 different items just for 1 mob...

0,Hi etho! Do you have any plans for episode 600?
0,"Etho just so you know, The Happy Ghast is in fact, affected by potions, so you can make them faster. I don't think it has the same code for horses and making them faster and faster, but you can use potions."
0,"I don't mind the timer for the ghast rehydrating. We wait for turtle hatching too. I wouldn't want every mechanic to be slow and unskippable, but a few optional time investment mechanics in a game I think adds some variety as long as the pay off is good enough. I think the happy ghast pay off is worth it. (Incidentally, I DON'T think the turtle pay off is worth it)"
0,Might be interesting for mass item moving.
1,"Hey Etho, since you really enjoyed Terrafirmacraft and modded Minecraft, have you ever considered giving Vintage Story a try? I know you once mentioned you'd stick to Minecraft for algorithm reasons, but Vintage Story is so similar, do you think it could still work?

1,The timer could be amazing for timing of games. You get a 20 min timer with 5 min intervals that you can easily track with redstone. You just remove the bucket at 19:30 mins and boom 20 min game timer with some hopper clocks.
2,I think what Happy Ghasts do is closer to suspended animation than estivation. At least to me it seems more of like a Waterbear rehydrating

1,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done. Hope you read this! :)

""Another type of beetle (Blepharida rhois) also chooses to aestivate. They usually do so when the temperature is warmer and will re-emerge in the late summer or early fall.""

So it would seem that unlike for an egg hatching, there isn't a specific term for coming out of estivation.

So I guess _re-emerge_ would kind of work, not sure if other words are used by the science hippies too."

12,"I really appreciate the hands-on demonstration of redstone contraptions that worked as an addendum to the comment of the day! I think one of your greatest strengths as a YouTuber, teacher, and presenter is your ability and natural proclivity towards filtering out what content deserves to reach your audience and make it into an episode. I suspect that process doesn't always FEEL so intuitive, but I would herald it as an Etho superpower.

I love when you show the nitty-gritty of your projects (as is the formula for an Etho episode) yet I don't mind when you scrape redundancy.

I think you show examples of this every now and then: of terrain you have cleared for miscellaneous projects like the ""passive mob farm island,"" or contraptions that fall short of their intended purpose. I'm satisfied with what we're given.

Thanks Etho, this is a great episode! Goofing off is fun, too. I will always enjoy seeing what you enjoy doing."
0,mr sir etho can you hit a triple neo?
0,"This is gonna sound like a grumpy old fart who doesnt know there are already mods to fix most of this.
Honestly I'm pretty disappointed in the whole update. To start, the fog is terrible imo. I build things cause I want them to look that way, not white washed once I get 30 blocks away. Then theres the happy ghast which cannot go down easily, swings around in a somewhat strange way when you look side to side, moves painfully slowly (slower than walking! How is that allowed?) And is prone to wandering away into the skies, resulting you needing an elytra to retrieve it.
Then theres the player locator bar that explicitly covers up the xp bar... (who makes a ui element that completely covers up another ui element). Honestly kinda feels like an amature put this whole update together for their own 5 year old"
0,Now I can make yo mama joke to the ghast
0,I didn't know the Summer version of hibernation is called aestivation. That's pretty cool.
0,"I'm just not a fan of the happy ghast at all.  It feels really out of place, like a silly mod from like a decade ago."

1,anyone else get an INSANE amount of ads with this video? like one every 5 minutes
0,Dried ghast torture timer is admittedly really funny. Its also a bit of a pseudo-random pulse generator if they only update on ticks. Might be a bit more compact than crop rng?
7,The Aether name tag seems so fitting. The happy ghasts would fit right in
0,I feel like Etho needs to make a level 2 to ravager rush on top of the happy ghasts after watching the last bit
0,Turtles also take a long time to hatch.
11,"They aren't using random ticks; they are scheduled ticks with a fixed length of time.  Once the Dried Ghast is on `hydration` level 3, then it's a random chance that it grows up at it's next scheduled tick.

If you are in creative and want to speed it up use the Debug Stick and make it hydration Level 3."
0,"ETHO POSTED YAY! I was rewatching wild life from his POV, but then I finished it. So I started watching hermitcraft season 7 bc I missed out on that season and it has lived past my expectations."

0,"Hey, love your videos. I saw you used Regeneration Potions on the Happy Ghast. Have you tried other potions on it? I was wondering if a Swiftness Potion would improve their speed?"
0,Try using a riptide 1 trident + elytra when it is raining to transport the happy ghast ;)
2,So dumb question but did you ever try speed potions? Not the best solution but maybe it's better than nothing?
0,"They diatroyed rocket-powered mob dangling? What a shame. Anybody broken the news to Scar? Is he okay? :,("
0,"i do like the happy ghast, but they should be a little bit faster. maybe not by default even, but a potion of speed should work for example, or maybe feeding them cake?, i dont know, but their speed is too slow to be usable and is a shame, because i think people would use them if only they were as fast as a donkey. i mean it flies, it stays around you, is more or less smart enough not to get killed while you do other things...

i get that their speed is suited for actually building, as you have shown with the slabs in the guardian farm, and that is good too, but still, there should be a temporary way to make them faster

the 40 minute timer on the other hand is a lot for a more casual player i suppose, i actually didnt think of that because 20 is standard timer for all the mobs, but this one is actually X2 and you cant skip half of it... i suppose that they want them to feel special, maybe is also because is the new thing, and in the future it will be easier, like they did with the lodestones, now they take iron, when before they took netherite"
1,why are there happy ghasts now?
3,Feeding happy ghasts snowballs is EXACTLY why they need to stack 64 instead of 16.

0,Eefo day! Today is a good day!
0,oh boy time to grab my snacks
0,"Now that I've seen them for a bit I feel like they're missing size variation. Like they want us to be attached to them, but every happy ghast looks the same. So either make them faster and just have them be the functional build helpers people want or add some lovable variations. Or do both things. Don't know why a lot of new things feel like they're pre-nerfed."

0,can you give them speed potions?
0,"This was such a classic fun episode, thanks for the video!"
4,"the 20 minutes timer makes sense. Turtle eggs take forever to hatch and it's only during nighttime. I think it teaches kids that patience is necessary and also if you can't find anything else to do in your minecraft world for 20 minutes than literally just afk, play with the ghast and log off bc that's what you're gonna do anyways

like, as a chemist and nature lover... sometimes things literally just take time to happen, not even just biological processes"
27,"I've had to replay several parts of this video to understand what Etho's saying because I got too distracted by the cuteness. Ghasts leading other ghasts, the horse pulling a ghast around - oh my goodness!

Been away from the community for a bit now, but I always love learning about new Minecraft updates from Etho.

Thank you for keeping the game alive in my (and I'm sure so many others as well) heart. Thank you for being you, Etho! ‚ù§"

0,what if you used a trident with the enchant that lets you rush forward? try it during the rain and maybe you can use it while saddled in.  or park in a puddle to try
0,he didnt try the og tnt launcher
0,"32:50 I, for one, would love to see a Soul Speed sorter."
1,"They could increase the dried ghast timer based on underwater blocks present around the dried ghast like coral, seaweed, prismarine etc.
Would be fun to have players be encouraged to make a small habitat for them instead of dumping them in a 1x1 water tile."
0,I'm a happy ghast now
0,"Love your stuff Etho! With the new computer set up, any shot you'd be willing to upload at 1440? 1080 looks pretty rough nowadays with Youtube compression. Its closer to 720 or worse... Not your fault, but I thought it was worth asking. Thanks for years of amazing stuff"

1,Yay!!

22,"With both this update and the previous one, you‚Äôve had an absolutely bonkers turnaround time for your videos! Very impressive!

The inclusion of Aether and Ur-Ghast (and others, I‚Äôm sure) in the happy ghast names is absolutely adorable, I love them a lot. You‚Äôve me nostalgic about Twilight Forest now! Also, this has actually taught me about the term ‚Äúaestivation‚Äù and I‚Äôm so determined to start using it, so thanks for that!

Your tests in this video were so incredibly interesting and thorough, absolutely worth the watch. I can‚Äôt wait to see what people do with the happy ghasts; their slow speed makes them seem impractical for a lot of stuff (most types of travel, notably) but there‚Äôs so much more that they‚Äôre definitely to be great for. 

I almost want to see about making some type of minigame similar to keeping a balloon from falling on the floor by hitting it upwards‚Ä¶ knockback weapons are sure to make these guys go flying!"
0,i bet theres something fun between happy ghasts and allays with leads. they might keep the allays from flying away
1,"Great thing is that Happy Ghast can carry boats, which means you can get enemy mobs like Vindicators in the air. I only wish that they would try to fly a bit higher when having cargo, right now the boat keeps bumping into the ground all the time."

0,Maybe if you sleep the night it‚Äôll knock half the timer off the hydration?
1,"Agreed. I think that the 20 minutes unskippable time is too long for the wait times. Feeding snowballs should speed up both phases, imo."
0,"8:21 I'm pretty sure the term ""wake"" is used. The ghasts wake from their dormant state"
0,Interesting at 19:27 that you have that shape on screen... Very coincidental indeed üòÇ

4,"To answer your ""waiting question"": I've always been annoyed by copper oxidation. It's not fun to wait for it to oxidise, I don't want orange in builds where I want copper green, and there's very few methods to speed it up (and they're very non-intuitive). I end up hating using oxidised copper even when it would look good because of the oxidation process, and usually go for prismarine even though it's not the same shade. I can definitely see the same happening with the Happy Ghast, though I like your tomogachi idea as a way to have fun in the meantime."
10,"Enjoyed the playing with sound moments, and the names too were great. I also appreciate that you include trial and error, it‚Äôs the journey. Thx for the content as always .  Now I‚Äôll go back to re-watching (again) Friday Night Stabby vods."
0,"I agree that 20 minutes is probably pretty excessive for the (revitalization?) time, but the argument about attachment is a fair one to make too. It‚Äôs kind of one of those tricky things that has you asking if it‚Äôs a good  thing to have an aspect of it that can‚Äôt be super optimized, or if it‚Äôs too frustrating that it can‚Äôt be optimized in that way. 
Either way, I think just a bit of a time cut might be the better solution for it."
1,"Etho you should play on the zero minr server if you want to do parkour - it's one of the oldest minecraft servers with a lot of history and the community is amazing, they have loads of high quality maps and you can play at whatever difficulty you want.

0,I wonder if the old bow boosting would work for gaining height while dragging the ghast TBH
0,etho uploading always makes me happy
1,"As a modded player I don't really like the new release schedule. Modders have no chance to keep up with updating and developing their mods.
With the old release schedule, large/important mods usually updated every other version: 1.12, 1.14, 1.16, 1.18, 1.20 were all popular versions for modding. The rest got skipped by most large mods because modders didn't have the ability to bugfix, update and add features as fast as mojang updated the game.

I fear that an even faster update schedule will make creating modpacks much more difficult as mods will get scattered all over many different versions as a result, but we will see how that turns out. After all, these updates are supposed to be smaller so maybe updating mods to a new version will get easier?"
0,Ur-Ghast mentioned! (I love twilight forest)
84,"i feel like the happy ghasts are the perfect amount of derp that go well with etho. i hope we get to see more of them! (i also hope you eventually name one taxes)

0,I really enjoy your game update videos!! I love the different experiments and how goofy you get with them üòÇ Thanks for the video Etho!
0,"Hey etho! I think the issue you were having with the horse being pulled by the ghost is from the player sitting on the horse. Same happens with boats and other rideables. But, if you attach a boat with a pig wearing a saddle to a ghast, you can ride the pig and the ghast will fly around by itself! Not sure about the practical applications of it, but if there‚Äôs anybody who could think of something, it‚Äôs you!"
0,"The Happy Ghast parkour and Dried Ghast observer/sculk sensor mechanics have big adventure map potential. The parkour is an obvious moving platform jumping puzzle, which hasn't previously been easily do-able. And the sculk sensor stuff can be used to create a random timer for some survival challenge, like waiting for a door to open whilst some zombie hoard tries to attack you and you need to fight them off!"
0,I hate the newish rain changes too.
0,"Etho, you are loved!"
0,Those names!
2372,I think the timer is to prevent people from making them on site to help with building then killing them afterward.  Basically using them like disposable build aids instead of pets.
2,"Hey Etho, I was wondering how your commentary has changed and what you do to sound more charismatic than in your older videos."

0,Could the Happy Ghasts not being thrown high by the wind charges be because the player is sat on top of them? How would it work if the player was stood up instead of sitting?
0,Slab slab etho slab
3,I really liked that soul speed boots sorter sure It is probably more trouble than it is worth but still that is neat and could be applied in mob farms which have player kills involved and you get armor if you wanted to sort it or bin it easier.

I am finally building a ghast farm, I want to keep a few of these leashed in various places, I found a village up on a plateau between a bunch of mountains with ravines, its either build bridges or HAPPY GHAST LANDING STATIONS!

4,Who else is here after seeing the comment on geminitays past life episode one video?
1,etho im watching naruto shippuden rn are you proud of me
0,"this build is amazing, really looks so fun"
3,One of the only youtubers who actually sound different when they're sick
0,Etho you have blown my mind every episode for a decade if not more! Love the natural essence in your builds along with efficiency and cool tricks! Love the clock and little details. Love from your fellow Canadian!
0,Want to wish Etho a ‚Äúget well soon‚Äù and ask him how the heck his voice still sounds cool even when he‚Äôs getting raspier than sandpaper.
0,It's odd that Etho has a family at all. It seems like he has just been time immemorial.
0,"Man, that quiet raspy voice took me back to the days of Nebris and Mindcrack!"
0,"I love what you have been doing with the base, also the secret passages and space maximization are funny.
Glad to see that The Nameless Shop is now open. :D"
0,"Man, the voice crack macking it into the vid is insanely funny lol
The ravagers are funnier lol
It's late, butIi wish you a smooth recovery"

0,okay wow i read the comments about the voice but i did not expect it to get this bad
0,Did etho ever do a face reveal? Lol old video from 10 years ago here lol
0,Speaking of llamas
0,"I love the interior of the house Etho, really cool"
0,Wow Etho is not a AI.

0,=)
0,wow so this is the guy who made rekrap
0,"I love the speaking of llama's transition, lmao. first time I heard it, I rewound to see if there was context. second time, I was like, naturally this makes sense. Then the third time, I was like, wait, how does this make sense?"
0,Etho your next base should be a giant mechanical mess that only you can effectively navigate with levers and buttons that make things in all the wrong places
0,"25:35 I switched to flashback from ReplayMod a few months ago. Glad it‚Äôs getting more attention, I find it much better and easier to use over ReplayMod."
0,What if the ravagers looked inwards and down like they are staring down a player standing in front of the shop?
0,How did you get the llamas to circle around sandy city?
0,This voice only gets better through the episode
0,You should try Vintage Story. It‚Äôs the continuation of Terrifirmacraft by the creators
0,"Hey Etho!
I heard you were complaining about Windows 10 and now you are going to switch to Windows 11 on your new PC. Windows 11 might be better than Windows 10, however, there is more ""Microsoft"" advertisements in Windows 11 than in Windows 10. Have you maybe thought of switching to Linux? Many are now actually switching, and you are mostly using Minecraft right? Minecraft is well supported under Linux, as well as almost all steam games as well. You might need to switch editing software or find simillar software for this. I would recommend Linux Mint, for a beginner. It is almost set up out of the box, drivers are easy to install (Nvidia drivers)"
0,"Etho its okay i know your secrert i know you are the REAL KAKASHI SENAEI You are secretly Japanese and the irl KAKASHI SENSEI yes you are canadian BUT foooooof

0,"thanks for making a video despite being sick! i love what you did with your base, and your shop looks even more awesome now~
i hope you get well soon <3"
0,with the new pc maybe we could get more modded stuff soon? ü•∫
0,Now we all need pants with Etho's face on it. XD
1,"Etho I just gotta say, I‚Äôve been watching you content for probs 10 years at this point & I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever left a comment, thank you for all the videos"
0,"I hope you feel better soon! fun episode, love the little ravager statues, they're super cute!"
0,is this replay mod-ish thing something that will used in your LP. I know you dont use mods in that series but i think this one could add to the viewing experience
0,3:59 and 14:37 speaking of llamas serotonin
0,I liked the snapshot of Etho's videos in 40 years
0,Etho has 19:11
0,"Hiya Etho! Feel better soon!!! Always wish you the best. You give us all a safe bit of time to enjoy, and that's priceless. Your build is gorgeous. I love the colors you used. Thank you!!! <3 ~respect"
0,"Feels like a Picasso home, kinda neat."
0,Doc? That you?
0,I appreciate you powering through your illness. hope you recover quickly.
0,maybe some copper trap doors & warped trap doors for the ceiling to break up the flatness and give it a little dimension? and anything hanging also does so much in my experience. lanterns can light up the ceiling a bit so the lighting is more evenly strewn about the room with maybe some lanterns on chains for differentiation! i'm sure you've thought of all this but i just want to give my two cents :)
0,14:50 I don't think anyone can beat X at that game but i'd like to see you try
0,Ethos over trying to be Tom Hanks!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0,Haven't played MC for years and the base tour felt like a fever dream ¬∑-¬∑
0,Etho appears to be so normal in other people's videos you would never expect him to be the most whimsical babygirl on Hermitcraft
0,Dude you can tell how much you were looking for anyway to stay busy you're doing things that I never thought would change but to be honest this is the best video I've seen from you in such a long time when you saw the smiley face on your pants and than notice the headband was so sincere it made me see you in a different light. This video was great
0,I love the ravager statues! so much personality and details
0,Andesite for the roof etho!!
0,Get well soon etho!
0,The functionality of the base while also looking great is what most players dream of
0,Etho apologizing for his voice again at the end of the video is the most Canadian thing ever
0,It's crazy how good you've gotten at building Etho! Well done!
0,ETHO IS EVOLVING üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
0,Really enjoyed the 'behind the sceens' of editing and the new software.  Hope you get betteer soon!
0,Did anyone else think etho sounded like batman
0,"when the world download becomes available, I will live in Etho's base"
0,"I was really expecting that Netherite diamond trim armor to end up in lava to turn the lava blue.
Love the base, Etho! So many nifty things."
3,"Hope you get well soon, Etho. Thanks for making a video, despite your worsening voice."
0,get well soon :) great apisode as always
0,If you keep going I‚Äôm going to have to turn on my subtitles. Lol go sleep.
0,18:30
1,"boy, you might've gotten me sick, too! I'm starting to sound like you at the end of the video, lol. Hope you feel better soon!"
0,I have always wondered how replay mod looked behind the scene
0,Ethos sounds like it chocolate island etho
0,"Hearing your voice getting rougher throughout the video hit hard, like dang dude really toughin' through it üí™ awesome job with Ravager Rush and the base, grateful as always for your content! Get well soon üôè"
0,Etho is so skilled he never used paper once in the rock paper sizors
0,dark prismarine ceiling?
2,18:25 saving this for no reason
0,Ethoo please bring back project Ozone or something similar!!
0,hi doc!
0,"I wasn't super stoked ahout the way the sign looked at first, but I love the way it turned out. Fantastic work as always!"
0,started to sound like Doc halfway through ü§£üíô
0,Speaking of Llamas says the man who was not at all speaking of llamas.
0,Another certified Etho classic. Love the end build with the minecarts and Snake riding the middle ravager!
0,"this was an amazing episode, i love how the ravagers went from accurate but kinda bland to NO WAY YOU WOULDNT üò≠üò≠. Also i think i lost it more than your voice at every cut"
1,For the ravager statues I feel like you could use slabs (dark oak most likely) at the same level as the eyes to achieve that squinting look they have. It would also increate their 5HEADs. Other than that everything is amazing! Hope you get well soon...!
0,@EthosLab for the ravage uni-browns can you try slabs instead of full blocks?
0,What about frog lights for the ravergers eyes?
0,"i like the colour stuff you are doing with the sign with the stained glass at the end, it looks more interesting than a single colour üëç"
3,"Thanks for the vid Etho, always happy to see you on my feed. BUT, get some rest dude, we all want you to feel better."
1,24:15 üòÇ
0,"34:17 make it so the ravagers are looking at the sign, it will make the sign more of a focal point"
57,"26:00 As a graphic designer for large retail signs, yes, kinda. 
So if you hold up your guide to the building from the place you want people to see (like a highway or street or back of a parking lot) then your font size should be at least 32-72pt in size at arms distance on a sheet of paper is the recommended amount.

Bigger the better...
- Now lets follow city regulations. (structurally sound, lighting/brightness, blocking skylines/horizons, etc.) Disney actually made a mandate that you cant build higher than X height in it's county because a skyscraper might show up.
- Now lets check the cost. (shrink the sign down to make it fit in the budget.) Companies like Walmart don't really have a budget cap we'd hit for example.
- Finally it's style, how does it look to the exterior designers and visionary of the brand. 


Quick guide on font sizing:
6pt: you don't want people to read
8-11pt: body text
12pt-14pt headers or low amount of body text (unless your typing an essay.)

Now we use the golden ratio to scale up from there for your headers:
Previously small font x 1.618 will be your  next scaled up font. 

This is all based around Letter paper size. 

So if you hold up your guide to the building from the place you want people to see (like a highway or street or back of a parkinglot) then your font size should be at least 32-72pt in size at arms distance on a sheet of paper is the recommended amount. 

Now go and design some signs!"
0,His sick voice idk why it hit me in the heart. I love it and feel. Bad for em. Sick streak is over
0,29:50 they sure are good boys
0,"Considering the limited time you had for this episode, your progress was insane... and you're sick on top of that. Love the new front of Ravanger Rush "
0,Etho = No(Time + Plan) = Complete Episode
77,The way Etho's voice was progressively getting worse the longer the video went was both hilarious and sad üíÄ. Hope you feel better Etho!
0,"I think the Ravager forehead should be one block higher perhaps!
I love the expressions, anyway!!
Edit: Yeah, especially when seen from below, I think they should be higher."
0,"I'm a bit late, but I love how you and the rest of the Hermits stick to making your videos about Minecraft. It's not about showcasing something bizarre, new, or ""impossible"", nor is it about telling some kind of scripted story that you are placing on top of your gameplay as some sort of recap. Everything you all do is for the sake of playing Minecraft -- building, making minigames, enjoying other people's creations, etc. Just taking in time to enjoy what the game has in *real time* is what makes us enjoy your content and be fine with your time lapses."
0,Early 2010s Etho came back by the end of the episode üòÇ
0,"Why do you get sick so much, bro?"
0,üíöüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è
0,There‚Äôs zoning requirements that regulate the size of signs.  In our city your sign can be 2 sf for every foot of building wall width.  Your sign would likely be way over then sign size requirements and would require a Variance.  Thankfully this is Minecraft though and no one cares.
0,"Etho seams to be collorblindüòÇüòÇ
Blue=Green/turquoise üòÇ"
0,Hope you're feeling better soon ergo! ‚ù§
0,appreciate you fighting through the sickness to get this done. take some rest & enjoy tge ti.e with your family
0,"I hope Ethos knows even if he loses his voice forever we'll still watch anything he makes, great episode, hope you get better tho"
1,"Love how Egor made a cameo towards the end there o; 

We havent heard from them is years how is Egor doing these days etho? :p"
0,I would love if u did a better the wolves play though I think u would like it also
0,The voice crack cracked me up lol
0,"Thank you for the dedication it‚Äôs much appreciated but now it‚Äôs time to rest up 
:)))))"
2,"25:05 I highly recommend using the flashback mod, once you get the hang of it, you're able to make some amazing stuff with it! I've personally been using the mod for some projects, the amount of control it gives you has given me opportunities to create some really cool cinematic shots. I'd love to see the inclusion of the mod in some of your future videos!"
1,Etho you don‚Äôt really need ‚ÄúFlashback‚Äù if you can use ‚ÄúTimelapse‚Äù it‚Äôs so much more easier
0,"i wont lie, at first glance, i thought those ravagers were given pink buttholes"
0,Enjoyed the episode. Hope you are feeling better.
7,"@13:05 That deadpan humor gets me every time, lol"
0,I grabbed my snacks
0,"idk who the man is at the end of the video, bring back etho!!"
0,I have the same birthday as you
0,"Love the new ravager rush build, one suggestion maybe is to change the green frog to a different color as it doesn't have the same ""oomph"" as the red one since it blends more with the rest of the build's colors."
0,Your colour palette for the base is beautiful!! It all comes together wonderfully
0,Is this an etho video or a doc video ahah get well soonüòÇ
0,The interior is beautiful. You really hit home with this one. Too bad you'll use it sparingly.
0,Etho turned into Nebris! Thanks for the video as always. Rest well!
0,"Rest well and recover soon ! this episode was very interresting to watch, especially the ravager simplification ! :D"
0,I actually like the glimpse of the behind-the-scenes process! Glad you had some time and had fun with it!
0,"Awww etho üíîfeel better soon! Thank you for the vid! Loved the ravagers!!!! So cute.

Honey in tea is good for a sore throat :)"
19,Sick Etho reminds me of Etho from years and years ago when he spoke much more softly and quietly
0,NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT LLAMAS!
0,He sounds like his olllddddd self with the way his sick raspy voice is and with how much slower he has to talk lol
0,Wish you a speedy recovery Etho!
3,"_We need to introduce Etho's house as lore!_ 
THE James Bond Etho   _E007_
But colorblind. 4:50
He probably pulls a plant out of a pot to activate potions out of the ceiling, wall, or flooring. Animators?
Awesome Job"
0,"Wow the basemenet of the base is looking really good. Your build style continues to be one of the most unique and enjoyable to watch come together.

Also - freaking loving the new recording tech; super fun to see more of the build process in a way that doesn't dominate the video (which I know is something you've been concerned about in the past).
We love your voice btw. Its very very soothing. The raspiness wasn't particularly bad sounding until the last 5 min at which point it was only uncomfortable to listen to because I felt I could imagine it being uncomfortable for you.

Massively appreciate you squeezing out a video between all your family obligations."
0,"With a little bit of accent, his voice at the end would be great for an impression of Docm üòÇüòÇ"
0,Thx for the episode
0,"I've never seen those as chains, always thought of them as mouths. Now I can't see anything but chains."
0,"There is a game like modded Minecraft in your old play called Vintage Story, check it out,"
0,"The behind the scenes watching you build is a big change compared to last month or even many years ago when I started watching you, but it makes the videos feel more complete and fulfilling in my opinion. I commented on an earlier video saying how it would be cool to have these types of interactions (not sure if you saw it or not) but it's cool seeing it come to life and makes me feel more involved in the process instead of a cut to it all being done and you explaining what we missed keep up the good work etho and get well soon!!"
0,Always love any episode you put out. Hope you feel better soon!
0,The baked-light-gradient base is *very* Von Sway.
0,"Hello E tho, I love your videos!"
0,Thank you daddyü•µü•µü•µ
2,Etho you need to rest üò°
0,I love hearing about your behind the scenes stuff
0,so cute!!!
0,The go-carts rock!
0,"We really appreciate you still going through with this episode even though your voice worsened more and more. It was both hilarious and painful at the same time. And that voice crack was legendary haha.
Overall an excellent episode regardless of the circumstances :D
I wish you the swiftest of recoveries!"
0,Give one of the Ravager a derpy expression to mirror the meme of the three dragons with 2 serious and 1 derpy face !!! Loving the vids ‚ù§
0,"If you're searching for things to do (and in case you forgot), I'm just gonna mention the fishing rod fight club arena."
0,Legend!
0,Awww you sound so sick by the end of this video my dude. Go get your feet up and have a good brew xx
0,"Try using half slabs to move the unibrow half a block lower. It'll really help with the proportions to make it look more like a ravager and less like an illager.

Wonderful episode, by the way."
0,17:44
0,I dont think I've seen a hermit go into that much detail on their thought process for a sign. I really enjoyed the perspective and breakdown of the design philosophy
0,Got my snacks!
0,Maan i want to see somebody make cubs rock paper scissors completely random and then fight him and see how long it takes him to figure out that its random xD
0,I was like ‚Äúif I was him id put the ravagers looking down over the sign‚Äù he then proceeds to and then also capture the nostalgia of an old McDonalds play pen or Safari Run. The creativity is always so fascinating
0,"by the end, Etho ended up sounding like Nebris"
0,"when you were looking at the ravagers and you said ""muzzle"" it made it think ""what if ravagers actually dont have a big nose and that is just a muzzle?"""
0,how did Etho get Doc to do the oiceover at the end?
0,"Yes, I thought the same, a very useful Base, and good looking. Annnd thanks for not scraping it ü§ó"
0,The interior looks really good!!!
0,sick etho sounds like my uncle and now i am missing vancouver ):
0,1:56 you can probably use purple to connect lighter shades of blue to pink
0,Don‚Äôt wanna shovel sand?!! You mean like a sucker would do?
0,I love the goofy ravagers!! You naild it!
0,Thank you for your videos
0,"Here before etho hogs all the server's glowstone to put below his lakes/ponds.

Jokes aside, awesome content!"
0,So just so everyone new and old knows yes Etho's skin is Kakashi of the sharingan
0,33:47 reminds me of a place called goats on the roof or smth like that
0,Take care ethoüò¢
0,Etho‚Äôs voice is already soothing. Like if I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping I turn on a video of his. But sick Etho‚Äôs voice is just another level.
0,"I loved seeing the behind the scenes of your video. I always wonder how content creators use replay and mods like it to make videos in minecraft, so that was a neat peek into it!"
1,"As someone who works in graphic design it is absolutely a thing that big corporations do, there's actually a science to how big your font is externally and internally.  Especially at the grocery stores, they will intentionally make the font in the isle small so if you stand on the end of the isle you have to walk into the isle a little bit to fully read them, potentially prompting you to buy something you weren't there for."
0,Maybe for the village room. Crimson or warped wood slabs and stairs. Crimson stairs and Warped slabs.
0,I knew the painting in the entrance was going to have something!
1,#Etho what program was that? Id like to try it out!
0,In the last few minutes it sounded like chocolate island Etho
0,Half slabs over the eyes for the unibrow would also give the bigger forehead.
0,"Your poor voice, I hope you get better Etho!"
0,"I always thought the ravager's ""harness"" was its mouth. You can see through it even."
0,"Honestly, for the time lapses,  just flying around doing a voice over while watching previous Etho build is a good way to do it. I find those smooth key frame shots very repetitive and it makes every time lapse look the same. Flying around like that makes it feel more personal and then you can point at things directly as you talk about which is cool"
0,I wish you good health ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§ó
0,"Feel better, Etho!"
0,I feel like Etho is in a constant state of sickness
0,I‚Äôve been watching for like 12 years prolly more has been the only consistent thing in my life
0,"i love the cartoon eyes on the ravagers, i hope you feel better soon etho!"
1,you sound like terraria zombie by the end ‚ù§
0,"Sorry to hear you've been feeling ill Etho, I hope you're feeling better soon. It was crazy hearing your voice change throughout the episode though. Really like the design of the Ravager rush building, and the Ravager faces are hilarious absolutely love them. Keep up the great work Etho!"
1,"""Frogs and Frags"" would encompass both Rush and froglights."
0,I hope you're OK.
0,Hope you get better Etho!
0,What do you mean a couple weeks..
0,Just wanna say get well.Been watching for a long time. Love every upload I get from you :)
0,Upstairs colors are Victorian era ones.
0,top of ‚Äúseason 10‚Äù hermitcraft search!
0,"I think maybe your sign would look more unique? personalized? if you moved the Rush to the right margin and doubled the wake lines as if the 'RUSH"" was moving left to right. Loved the episode. Thanks for the great entertainment."
0,"Suggestion: if you use blackstone (or any dark color) half slabs for the ravager brows, you can make smoother  lines for cartoonish expressions while still keeping the unibrow effect. Also, the minecarts are adorable. They look like faces üòÅüòÅ"
0,"etho found flashback mod!!!!!!!!!!!! everybody panic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
also etho you could release an hour long episode with no voice whatsoever and i'd practically watch it twice, *fans* will watch anything (might not appeal to all viewers- especially not new viewers- i admit, but still, we'll watch anything you want to make!!!)"
0,Stay hard working etho we love you
0,"I love the goofy ravagers. now if only youtube would recommend me your videos on time. I spent the entire day yesterday on yt, I watch everyone of your uploads but i guess youtube thought no let's just recommend slop instead."
0,"Yeah, Etho, it's fine. Go ahead and take all the time you need to take care of family stuff and take care of yourself. We'll all be here when you're rested, healthy, and ready to make videos again."
0,feel better etho!!! we missed you!!! ty for the upload ü•∞ü•∞
0,:insert drawing of a cow as a bookshelf: (she's smiling and very happy to hold your books for you)
0,Started to sound like Nebris at the end of the episode lol
0,"hey etho hope you are in good health, just wondering if youve seen any of the color theory videos by gneiss name, he's made a 3D display that shows where blocks would be in relation to their color. If i remember right it was very configurable, thought it might be a good resource for you and your building style"
0,Really appreciate the behind the scenes look at replay. Gotta say the freecam look at the speed-up footage was so cool - way better than the smooth camera. It's more the Etho style.
1,"This video made me want to cough lol, thank you for making a video!"
0,"i'm rewatching this episode for the second time already, i love it so much"
0,Are the paintings vanilla?
0,"I always love hearing and seeing your Behind the Scenes things, it makes the videos seem more personal. I remember you talking about some behind the scenes stuff in a SP video a while back on how you did your recording. I think it was around the Lava Cauldron episode."
0,"Wild armor trim looks awesome on boots, makes them look like sneakers."
0,21:42 not etho (unintentionally?) teasing the life series!
1,We should get a whisper episode
0,"i just want give you a tea with honey, or maybe a very spicy chili. feel better. eefo!"
0,"""Not supposed to show the behind the scene editing""?
I'm actually LEARNING something during the 'montage'. This should be STANDARD!
Yknow Just tips and tricks about the editing software, while the building is built shown.
YOU put as much of a standard as anyone else. Maybe people follow your minecraft standards more than of others, but that's not the point I'm trying to make."
0,Get well soon! üéà
0,Your base really does look pretty nice.
0,"""I took a little bit of a break""?
You took a little bit of a crack you mean? Voice crack.
Summer crack's about to begin in Sweden. The vibe will be so good ^^"
16,29:00 I love that the eyes on the statues appear when you get closer. Almost like they're waking up as you approach
3,"*@EthosLab* 29:09 Ravagers, ask *(Mob Boss) Scar* to deliver some ravagers to your game roof :)
Maybe you can hide some rails behind the sign, and then have a ravager in a minecart drive around, so from the ground, it looks like the ravager is first poking its head up on the right side, then on the left side, then somewhere else... (maybe randomly determined route?)
31:50 At LEAST 1+1 blocks wider, or 2+2 blocks wider (2 blocks on each side), currently that is just a ""villager dimensioned"" ravager, ravagers are wider than villagers. (Get well soon!)"
0,‚å®üéÆ
1,"*@EthosLab* 22:39 You actually do HAVE moss half-slabs, including vertical half-slabs....
Use the armor-stands mod & sink a moss-block halfway into another (offset by a pixel, to avoid Z-fighting flicker).
ZombieCleo used this technique on her house, to make 2 trap-doors take up the same block in an inner-corner, cor a complete border of trap-doors around the foundation of her house.
Just make sure the base-plate of the armor stand doesn't intersect a solid block, that screws up the lighting (I think? ask Cleo if needed)."
1,etho is finally 15
0,"i was thinking big ravager statue/facade over the building and a frog on its head or something with some froglight acessories/bling (necklace,ankle band...)"
0,"Ooof, hope it's not the razor blade throat variant I've been hearing about. Hope you get plenty of rest either way!"
0,I love the new Ravager Rush exterior. Feel better soon!
0,The ravagers are definitely my new favorite part of this build
0,Oh my god oh no
0,Hope you get better Etho!
0,"Hey etho, I wonder how it would look if you placed a pink banner under one of the ravengers. I wonder if it would look like a tongue sticking out or if it would be too distracting."
0,I like the flashback shots where you fly around doing super fast build mode.
0,lol now I know I build innie doors too.
1,"With that goofy expression on the right ravager, it really reminds me of the three dragon heads meme."
0,RIP your voice towards the end
0,"Sign looks great, love the Ravagers, the different coloured glass really adds to the nature element of the game.

Go get rested Etho! Hope you feel better soon."
0,"Had a moment in YT last week. I just finished driving through BC and YT to Alaska. I was driving about 5am just north of Whitehorse and I saw something off to the side of the road in the distance. I figured it would be elk but as I approached it became horses. Four beautiful spotted wild horses at sunrise. One was a colt and they all had spots, the colt had large caramel brown spots over pearl white and they all had long white tails. I thought to myself 'is this Minecraft?'. I've seen quite a few wild horses but they always look scraggly and usually single color. This was amazing. Unfortunately they were skidish and my truck is a bit loud so I didn't get a pic. I ask the Bison blocking the road from time to time if they've seen a wild 'Etho' but they never talk."
0,Absolutely awesome build!
0,Ethos going thru puberty at 18:31 lol
0,Why was this not recommended until today
0,I think one angry one would've looked fine next to the other ones.
0,That is a really nice exterior to the ravager rush! Get well soon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π did not mind the voice going raspy üòä
0,"that sounded like ETHO AI voice at the end LOL, get well soon"
0,instead of taking off one piece of gear and putting on a different one... wouldnt swapping your chest plate and elytra do the same but only be one click?
0,"I loved the video Etho!
Editing that and hearing your own voice so bad must have been dreadful but thank you for putting in the effort and time to make such a good episode 
I hope you feel better soon and have a wonderful day üòä"
0,Feel better soon etho!
0,"I absolutely love him saying Before we wrap up here akk throughout the episode, never gets old"
0,"I feel like they need a bit more forehead ü§î But they are awesome üòÅ
Speaking of llamas, get well soon Ergo!"
0,7:45 he didn't put that much effort??? I did NOT notice
0,Aw Etho!! Please rest up that voice ü•∫
0,Of course Etho's base is full of secret passages. He's living up to the Kakashi skin this time
0,8:50 the blue is perfect
0,"Yes there is font size math! The stuff I know is mostly used for billboards though. Human eyes can discern a certain amount of black/white switches within a certain viewing angle before it becomes grey. From there, a couple measurements of the smaller features of your font and expected viewing distance, boom, smallest viable font size"
0,listen to the end of the video then go back to the start and the difference is crazy
0,I think nebris took over the commentary near the end there
0,Man slowly turns into Miley Cyrus.
0,maybe make the trapdoors over that right side entrance @ 2:58 blue or make a tiny fountain right there so there's some water flowage going on
0,"Rest well and feel better soon, and I hope you enjoy your time with your family! The new front to RR looks inceedibly adorable, and your base is coming along amazingly :-) A fantastic episode as usual!"
0,You should add some brown carpet or wooden pressure plates in the base especially under those item frames @ 2:10 (in addition to the green)
0,"Hahaha the developing look on the ravager was a hilarious process! love it, take care!"
2229,"Dang dude, hearing your voice slowly change was wild! The entrance looks amazing :-D I have to play it now."
0,"I hope you get/got better, but not going to lie, at some moments I had bit of a crush on your scuffed voice lol. üò≥"
0,oh my gosh that final look is so good
0,Hope you get well soon bud! The sign is absolutely superb :D
0,In the last five minutes you can hear his voice getting worse lol
0,Thanks for squeezing in the episode! Had a lot of fun watching it!
0,Me when YouTube doesn't send me an upload notification for Etho: üò∞
1,Snake and the rooftop ravagers are adorable! So cute! aaaaaaa
0,"24:12 Not belly buttons, I knew you were talking about Severance!"
1,"Hey Etho, i think your small base with amazing detail is nice to look at and i think you already expert on it. for the next HermitCraft Season i hope you can make a Mega Bases that very big in size and maybe not to focused on small detail but more on big scenery or bases."
1,Poor etho began to sound really sick towards the end thanks etho for battling on to give us a video hope you get better soon üòä
0,24:15 thanks for the clarification
0,What does it feel like to be so cool?
0,I feel like a blackstone Ceiling might go hard in the villager room.
0,Ravagers basically look like a villager buffalo
50,"That Rock Paper Scissors match with Cub was illuminating. I think Etho would be an amazing chess player, but would always choose to play checkers over chess because it's easier for more people to be competitive. It's not about winning, it's about the thrill of a close game"
0,I found it easier to use the light overlay mod when trying to get that light affect on the floor. I‚Äôve been experimenting with it for the last two years and there‚Äôs a lot more freedom in it than I initially thought (especially for ceiling designs
2,"I can't find a logical reason why, but listening to Etho's cracking voice feels like some kind of special ASMR theraphy.
Maybe it's something about how all the energy has to be drained out of the sentance to be able to speak.
And there is just the laid back casual voice remaining, not the loud and clear show host voice that one tends to develop with a series."
0,"We love etho, because etho loves us."
0,New computer = new video skills
0,All that matters too me is that you have a roof üòä

0,Get well soon Etho. Your videos are always so amazing and funny. üòÉüòÉüòÉ
0,Mad powering through power! I hope you feel better quickly buddy! Enjoy your family time!
0,Etho sounding like Docm at the end XD
0,For every single youtuber who said that they are sick I can't tell the difference.. but my god! Etho are you okay? You sound like you are dying. üò¢
0,feel better etho!
0,hope you get better soon man
0,"Oh boy that voice was rough in the end üòÇ never heard it that bad! Get some tea with your snacks! Was a great episode, really enjoyed watching some more build focused episode again! You are a much better builder than you give yourself credit! Especially when it comes to your knowledge of color theory"
0,Get well soon Etho!
0,Etho's buildstyle my beloved ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
0,I love how Ethos always improving himself. Looking forward to see what new editing techniques he learns.
0,"Etho's doing  time-lapse builds? What's next? Thumbnails?! 

Jokes aside, builds look great, feel better soon!!"
0,This makes me want to play with statues. Love seeing your process with how you made the ravager statues
0,"hope you feel better soon etho !!!!! lovely to see you back in hermitcraft. I LOVE the base additions, feels very comfortable, cozy, easy to get around!! for the ceiling color... maybe something brighter? like birch or even just oak could be nice. I liked the copper but it also felt kinda dark in there for the villagers

AND I LOVE that you're figuring out the flashback mod!! It's always such a treat to see how people build their builds and it was so cool to see you do that too

rest up !!! drink warm drinks!! enjoy family!!"
0,"Your poor voice. That did not sound fun, haha."
0,Get well soon buddy
651,"Usually when YouTubers say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sick, sorry about my voice‚Äù, I can‚Äôt even tell the difference, but Etho at the end was sounding pretty sick‚Ä¶ Hope you get better soon, loved all the progress!"

0,"Might be nice to have a little swamp terraforming out front. Looks awesome as is, though!"
1,Looks great Etho!
0,Ravager rush looks amazing
0,Get well soon.
0,"For the right ravager statue, you could try copying what you did for the right eye to the left eye (eyebrow and all) and it'd look like he's rolling his eyes."
0,Can you fit in something to punish anyone that might mine through the door to your villagers instead of using the correct redstone?
1,Pls you too take care. Macho-etho should be present for the upcoming life series
0,Damn I really like that ravager rush build!
0,Damn I really like that ravager rush build!
0,"Glad you showed off Flashback, that seems like fun to use! Might check it out :D"
0,I feel like there's a good opportunity to have the ravagers chill in a pool/hot tub on the roof here.
0,"You can really hear etho having to strain more as the episode goes on, thank you for your sacrifice sir! This episode was awesome!"
0,"Take care, -etho- ergo!"
0,"I used to be up in Kroger, there is a mathematically superior script size for each purpose. Things such as price vs sale vs qualifying info are all different fonts to ensure they maximize sales. Font type doesn‚Äôt matter as much, so long as it is as easy to read as possible (no flowery stuff.) Fyi - they have actually calculated what areas of the store are best for increasing sales, and can accurately (within 1-2%) guarantee sales boosts of items based on location."
0,"Regarding your question about font sizes and relationships etc.  You want to look for some good typography books.  There were a few older (pre 2000, probably pre 1990) classics that are/were considered must read for College Design students.  It seems like much of that knowledge is fading away with todays computer tools.  Back before computers there was a lot of art, research and design into What makes good fonts, and the best visual impact etc.  It is a fascinating subject to explore.  Which reminds me I should probably go visit some second hand book stores for a classic or two for myself.  Post WW2 (50's 60's 70's...) was an amazing era and even earlier.

I believe that ""The Elements of Typographic Style""  is/was considered one of the best books ever written on the topic.  IIRC I read it years ago."
1,i like the design of things you did this episode a lot.
1,Flash back is revolutionary. How is it possible?
0,You low key sounds like docm77 xD
0,"I love the interior is so fun efficient, and complete. It‚Äôs crazy what you can do in this game."

15,"Hearing ""Speaking of llamas"" again healed something in me"
0,holy moley he's turned into jevin o_o
0,"I've found that pumpkins and melons are a good villager trade, especially if you don't have an iron farm."
0,Wearing a well fitting respirator (such as an N95) can help prevent illness!

1,rock ALWAYS wins.
1,"You should definitely try out the new resin armor trim material, I‚Äôm not big on the color orange, but the resin is still my favorite trim material."
0,Feel better soon Etho! That cold has been going around this part of the province recently for sure; seems like everyone I know has been getting a turn at it.
0,"Love all of this episode üòÇ 

Get well soon Etho! ‚ù§"
0,What Etho episode isn‚Äôt a weird one? HahahahaüòÇ
1,It may be more beneficial to let the villagers have line of sight of each other so they can communicate and potentially give you more discounts to you.
0,Get well soon Etho. Awesome design work!
0,"Hope you feel better soon, Etho! This episode was SO fun! I love the editing, variety, hermit interaction, and your fun whimsy! The ravagers look AMAZING! Their expressions are just so cute!"
0,You can go back to your eye position with smooth flashback camera for clean transition between 3rd person view and normal gameplay
0,This episode was so fun! Actually it made it even funnier how your voice changed thourghout the episode :D
0,"Hi, Etho's Dad!
Your son is a troll! üíØü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
0,"Awww Etho, I hope you feel better soon my dude. Rest your voice, don't know if you're a tea guy but some hot water with lemon juice, a bit of ginger and a touch of cayenne,  not a lot, a little goes a long way üòÇ  honey to sweeten. Horehound candy is also good."
49,"18:42 I always hear the canadian come out of gem whenever she says sorry but to hear it come out from etho for some reason blew my mind....don't ask me why, it just did"
25,29:18 etho's voice sounds like one of those old videos from like 2010 or smth
0,"23:30 The frog has a wicked wig :D

Speaking of llamas makes a return, yes :D
I really like the usage of Flashback, with your voice-over and a smooth camera timelapse. Making the ravagers cartoony was a great choice as you said, if it were me, I would keep the boring expression and not think too much of it, but the cartoony idea made it so much more fun! Putting them in minecarts and giving them tails is just great.
I didn't mind the voice; It felt more chill in a way, like in the past with ""ASMR"" Etho voice haha :D hope you get better though <3"
0,"Dont worry Etho, you are still on your normal upload schedule"

Thank you for just being there over the years, I really can't express what that's done for me personally in life (sounds cheesy but true)"
0,"Oh Etho I'm sorry you're sick. Thank you for the episode and don't worry about being super busy! Look after yourself and get better soon. Speaking of llamas! I really enjoyed the mini games you played and would love to see more of them, super quick but super funny and fun! ‚ù§"
0,"""I'm very happy to tell you... that we'll eventually get this done"". :D 
Love it. I'm gonnna use it for my work meetings :D

0,Raspy stranger
0,"Ive been following you for years now and I just want to say thank you for all you do. I have insomnia but your videos put me to sleep. I dont mean that in a bad way, they are always entertaining but i‚Äôll throw them on as white noise. You probably wont see this but i just want to say thank you"
0,"21:08 not sure if this was intentional by Etho but that color placement is _veeerryyy interesting._ 

With the new Life series teaser drop by Grian _the colors are veerryyy coincidental._ Even more so when the order of the colors from left to right matches EXACTLY as the color arrangment in the teaser drop üëÄüëÄ‚ú®

(Though then again, thinking about it, definitely not intentional since the ravager rush froggies is in those colors as well lol üòÜ)"
0,"Please don‚Äôt force yourself to do a video, when you're sick. Get well soon and take care of yourself!"
0,11 minutes in and that base of yours is just amazing

You've given a lot of inspiration to me as far as little things i can do to make things in my builds feel alive, though I'm such a dingus I haven't figured out how to make the storage mechanics work lmao the behind the scenes of freecam mod is very cool since I don't use it and have always wondered vaguely how it works."
0,the etho lore has been crazy latley. and oh hi bdubs
1,Towards the end of the video I was getting major old school Etho vibes with the sick voice. Had to change the video to 480p for the full effect
0,"Those cuts from flashback to your detached camera to your first-person view frp, 34:30-35:15 are so fluid. I LOVE seeing this kind of behind the scenes stuff, it's so fascinating. I had to watch it back to see what happened because I had no idea how we got to your first-person viewpoint. 

Sorry about your voice, yeowch. You still sound plenty clear but I can sympathetically feel how sore your throat is! Feel better soon Etho."
0,You sound like American keralis lmaoo
0,"Making the ""rush"" in the sign out of something like mangrove to really make it stand would make the sign bigger impact i think, but it looks great either way"
0,Really cool shop. The playback also works well to showcase those off camera moments sometimes. Hope you get better soon!
0,"yayyy, I got my snacks!"
0,"Not only is there math, there's artists and teams of people"

Your sign is fantastic and the ravagers are really funny to look at. Keep the good work up and don't worry because of too much time between videos. 

Greetings from germany üëã"
0,Was slightly hoping for Etho to put some eyes on the big Ravager Rush door and make it look like a giant frog. I like what you did more though!
0,"Honestly, all i could think of was that one bit of Etho getting frustrated by the comments about his voice changes from way back when, and the derpy ""I hope Etho's okay.""    Rest up man, was a fun episode."
0,"Etho, using Flashback???

No way!
Revolutionary!!! 
üòÜ"
13,"Hey Etho: for the front, you could add a simple, upright tree on either side to frame the building. It‚Äôs a common trick in landscaping, especially with cedar trees. As a bonus, trees visually blend into the background and keep the attention on the sign."
0,It‚Äôs a good day. Etho has posted
0,Get well soon!
0,"love your building style, it's always so creative ^^ get well soon etho!!"

0,have the eyes look at the door! great vid <3
0,hi etho
0,Etho why are you always unable to record when you have guests staying at your place for extended periods? Can't they just cope with (enjoy) the sound of your voice?
0,the occasional etho thumbnail that's on purpose are always fire
0,"as a big forehead girlie, I felt it personally when etho said the ravager is mostly forehead T-T"

0,"I love flashback, ive used it so much in my videos"
0,Maybe something with Amethyst blocks for the villager room.
0,You sound like a totally different person when your voice is really bad üòä
0,8:20 i feel some kind of bright yellow block would go well here fir the ceiling
1,"For the villager room ceiling - it seems like you've been enjoying your quirky redstone gizmos, you could try hooking the ceiling up to the day/night sensor and change the ceiling to match the sky. Maybe skulk blocks for nighttime/some hidden lighting on a blue ceiling for daytime. It would certainly need some extra room though!

Also wanted to say! If you enjoy small, easy puzzle games I recently started playing Colorma (a mobile game) where you place colors like a jigsaw puzzle to create different types of gradients. I have no affiliation with the game, but the color theory of it all seems right up your alley. Hope you get to feeling better and have a nice week"

0,I would consider switching the two outside ravagers. I think their expressions would be much more cohesive that way

0,Most entertaining game of rock/paper/scissors I've ever seen.
8,"I actually love seeing the behind the scenes stuff.  Also if you decide the color of the Ravagers are not quite right or want to add more color variation between the three you might try some of the various terracotta blocks, those add a surprisingly vast array of the desaturated browns and greys that get overlooked."
0,"Please give some rest, Etho üíê"
0,"Hope you're feeling better, Etho. I doubt anyone minds the ravaged voice, but healthy is better, of course. Ravager Rush's exterior now looks fantastic. I'm really appreciative of the colored glass behind the letters. It really makes it pop more. The ravagers are adorable, too."

They're always great. Like Gem. Gem is great."
2,"10:08 for this problem if you use a powdered snow block instead of the cyan terracotta, it will break the shulker box but because powdered snow is not solid the shulker box ends up inside the powdered snow instead of popping up."

0,"Interiors are awesome (the clock ! the colors !), and the entrance of the game is really cool (fits very well with that hermit's spirit).
The title of the video... xD Very nice xD
Suggestions for ravager statues :
- Maybe 7x7, to make them bigger than the frog ones ?
- Horns on the side of the head (would make them 7x5) ?
- Both previous ideas (9x7) ?
- One broken horn ?
- One horn with some other angle ?"

0,surprise surprise etho chose the green one XD
1,"After watching scar's stream today I just *have* to suggest some elderberry syrup, maybe a little light trampoline jumping, the occasional twiddling of the thumbs, a few snow angels - I sure that'll do the trick to heal you right up. ;) Okay but seriously don't record if you're feeling too bad! We can wait, we're used to it lol"

seriously though, get well soon etho, thankyou for making my life better over the last decade or so. ‚ô°"

3,this video brought me back to your older videos! Probably because you didnt have as much time but also the raspy voice was just really funny but hope you get better!  One of my favorites recently.
0,The ravagers are immensely cute. This episode was another demonstration of the many talents of Mr. Slab ‚ù§
0,I bet changing the color of the speedy lines on the ravager rush sign would make the words more legible.  From sandstone to something darker like jungle plank or mud brick
0,"Etho and Joel sick at the same time? A likely story. My theory is that Etho and Joel are the same person, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They have never been in the same place at the same time. Lizzie has only ever seen him in Joel form; I imagine that is because she would not recognize the Etho form, and moreover Etho's instincts kick in and cause him to quickly return to Canada every time he transforms back."

0,3:59 speaking of llamas reference omg!!!! who remembers lol
0,Honey with green grog lights behind it for the ceiling in your villager trailer

4,That illness is nearly taking him back to early days Etho lol. I don't mind at all. It doesn't limit your brilliance and thank you for sticking with it to crank out an episode for us.
0,"Love the 'secret' little detail with the carts & tracks underneath the ravagers on the sign, what a cool way to make the roof more interesting!"
0,looove all the cutesy secret knickknacks and passageways hidden around this base. kakashi the carpenter.

1,31:38 I think the big reason why it looks like an Illager more than like a ravager is that the forehead is too small. You should go harder on the forehead!

Really like what you did with Ravager Rush, the ravagers are absolutely adorable. And (speaking of llamas) those parts of your house's interior where there's that pop of blue (particularly the stripped hyphae) are really nice, my eyes were drawn right to it (in a good way)! Very cozy interior.
Get well soon, and hope you have a good visit with family! <3"

Great episode though! Thank you for powering through your illness to make this one a reality."

0,Love you Etho!
0,Any content is awesome content
1,"Thanks for the great video!! Glad you included Snake in the front decor, the whole time you were working on the ravages I was thinking hope Etho includes a representative of Snake the zombie. Didn't think you hold on long enough to include him. Get well soon."
2,"‚ÄúOne of these is a do-not-choose option‚Äù and it‚Äôs the one that I prefer lol it feels like I‚Äôve failed Etho üò≠

The title and description are absolutely perfect. Thanks for pushing through and finishing the video! Hope you feel better soon, Etho! Time for some nice warm tea üòå"
0,"Hey Etho, good to see you taking the time you need to deal with your personal life.  I know it's not a fun subject, and you'd much rather be doing pretty much anything else I imagine, but it's important to make sure to handle things right.  I'm sure you don't need to hear that, you seem like a smart and responsible guy, but I just want to put it out there in case you feel guilty about not being able to be present with your audience."
0,Poor Etho. You're voice sounds like you feel miserable. Rest up!
0,Get better soon!
35,Even Etho's family doesn't know he's Etho. Good job hiding your alter ego at yet another family gathering!
0,"No apologies needed! As always, any Etho video will always cheer me up!"
0,Is Etho okay? He just sounds super depressed this episode and I hope he‚Äôs alright.
0,I can confirm that scissors paper rock is the correct order. Thank you Cub
0,"I actually really like that he included his sick voice. 
1. it's adorable! haha
2. it humanizes him. I know I often feel like Etho is larger than life. like, some sort of Minecraft god or criptid or something. but hearing him be a little sick reminds me: He's just a guy =)
Feel better Mr. Etho-man!"

That's because you're not a sucker Etho!"
0,watched 14 last night and was disappointed i hadnt left one for breakfast this morning- so glad this has come out
0,So for the ravager statues maybe use Pale oak log or pale oak moss for lite texture?
0,Aww when he got excited over the smiley face
0,"Thanks for making us a video even though you are super busy and sick to boot. Super cool trio of little guys. At the risk of sounding too critical, I think the ravager nose should probably be darker than the cheeks, maybe even the same colour as the the uni-brow, to be more like the model. It's fine either way, since you were going for the cartoonish look, and not some pixel accurate recreations, but I still feel like the nose could be more prominent somehow. You could maybe hint at the chains / metal teeth mouth look with some horizontal chains or armor stand magic (or even both to get the chains centered between two blocks and pushed closer against it's face). I was expecting you to pull out some kind of slabs for the uni-brow, just to overlap the eyes and go for that squinty-eyed look, but I know how much that limits your pallet. There always has to be some compromise when working in Minecraft, especially on the smaller side of things. In the end the over all composition is what counts, and they look perfect perched across that sign and making faces at you. A great homage to the classic three monkeys / gargoyles theme."
0,Where are these llamas that he keeps speaking of?
0,Beautiful
0,eefo
0,Absolutely AMAZING job on Ravager Rush!! üòÅ
0,"At 33:59 (whilst redoing the RR sign), you place the left ""speedy lines"" one block farther left than you had them. You fix this in the next shot, but I actually prefer the speedy lines to be a little bit removed from the ""RUSH"" because it's easier to read when they aren't so close to the word. üôÇ"
0,Great episode as always!
0,I personally love the peek into how the video is made with the flashback. It's especially interesting because we can see you learn the software <3
0,The mischievous ravagers are so cute!
0,"I know you were wondering about what the font size to building ratio should be, but honestly because you were making your sign for a game, the font size you chose perfectly encapsulates that arcade game style that so well fits your theming."
0,Your interior is like walking through a painting!

A cool/funny thing could be if the frogs are looking at the centre of the door? 
I hope you feel better. :D"
0,"""Speaking of llamas"" puts a smile on my face every time!"
0,"Hey Etho! I love the sign you made for Ravager Rush, it's excellently legible, but I do have one small nitpick. I think it'd be worth trying out some different colored slabs for the racing lines, since as it stands they kind of blend into the words a bit and make the ""Rush"" part a little bit harder to read at a glance. That's it though, really enjoying your builds this season!"
6,"the voice deterioration helped make this episode shine, lol. Thanks for leaving it in!"
0,Get well soon Etho!
4,"That crunchy voice xD Voice breaking when you said ""break"" was fun... Hope you're feeling better now. Bdubs was right it's fine you sound good... xD
Speaking of llamas! Those ravagers look charming just like the frogs <3 
Adding the blue in your house is actually great or it would be too matchy matchy and with all the warm colors, adding the cool cyan lets the eye rest (cyan is one of my fave colors too so :D lol) I think the glazed terracotta is fine it's a fun little pattern not really overwhelming."
0,Etho... üòà
0,Etho with the dad voice and Bdubs with the mommy thumbs. Perfection.
0,Absolute banger of an episode dude.
0,I didn‚Äôt even read the title until halfway through and now I understand.
0,Oh my throat hurts as his voice gets worse lol hopefully it gets better fast especially with so many visitors!
0,=)  the base interior looks really neato and the ravager rush exerior has so much character its great
0,"Hey Etho. The base is looking cozy. Colours look good, keep the cyan creeper blocks. You don‚Äôt always see them and the poke of colour looks nice. I looked into it and the Gruen Transfer, also known as the Gruen Effect also applies to signs. Might be something to look into. I like how you have brought your IRL jobs into Minecraft from displays to plants. You can see your skills are well used still. Hope you are feeling better soon. 
I have been under the weather myself but I didn‚Äôt get the cool voice. Have to get back to working on the Skizzlecraft Halloween roller-coaster. I will let you know when it is finished and really to ride. Thanks for the episode and one last thing. Look into how jellyfish reproduce it is very cool and I think they might be related to coral."
0,"Feel better soon, and enjoy time with family."
0,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
0,"The Villager area's ceiling is too dark in my opinion. I would probably lighten it up a little. Maybe try calcite with the glow lichen or something on it to keep the color profile matching.

Edit: Mad respect for keeping the voice break in. I don't LOL very often, but that got me."
2,"Thanks for being a trooper, Etho. You bring peace and joy to a lot of people."
1,Put a road down the middle of the sign with water columns! Keep up the amazing videos and I hope you feel better soon.
13,"This is admittedly the hardest ive giggled in quite a while. The slow progression of voice deterioration admittedly had me giggling xD 

At 18:30 ish you have the start where you notice his voice is sounding bad, just a slight voice crack. 26:18 its MUCH worse and it sounds painful to talk, but the sick-giggle is so cute T-T The WHOLE interaction at 26:40 and after had me beaming from ear to ear, Bdubs sounds like hes convincing himself as much as Etho xDD and then the ‚Äúim scrapping this whole episode‚Äù xD Bdubs is such a friend üò≠ 

And then‚Ä¶ 34:49 T-T Oh Etho, dude, I hope you take a good long time to rest up, you sound like my paternal grandfather on his last days (which is awfully morbid but scarily true üòÇ) if I hadn‚Äôt known i was watching Etho, i wouldnt be able to recognize you and yet you still made the video entertaining and better quality than most of youtube, which makes it all even more impressive. You, sir, are a legend. Thanks for this episode, even if you werent at 100% (or even 35% lets be real xD) you still brought joy to our hearts üòä"
1,Etho describing ravager face. Sounds like describing Bevis & Butthead
1,"I hope you get better soon, just saw you on Scar's stream. üòä 
 cool, the colors look cool."
2,"Feel better soon, Etho!"
1,"Wow, getting a video out on a crazy short timeline!  Hopefully the time away will allow you to get it back."
1,Anyone else when Etho was choosing the colors for his sign couldn't help but wonder if he was giving a hint to the new Life Series?
1,loved you it turned out fell better soon
1,"""Speaking of llamas"" üòÇ"
1,Get well soon Etho!
1,"Every build Etho makes is so full of life and character. The cartoony style is so fun and so Etho!

P.s. take you time with your family and rest, hope you feel better soon"
1,Don't the Ravagers need one more block of forehead?! It's 50/50 in the mob and not 50/50 in your statues. They look great nonetheless.
2,"i love all of the detail you added into the ravager rush building - all of the little bits you added to the ravager statues specifically are so fun. and the way you pushed the expression on their faces is so good.

i had a really terrible day today for reasons i won't go into so i saved this episode for after i had to go through the worst of it and i'm so glad i did - this was so healing to watch. i hope your voice improves soon! it sounds painful :<"
209,"Might just be me, but the middle ground raspy voice just after the Bdubs segment started reminding me a lot of the early days of Etho. The low pitched slightly monotone voice, just felt very familiar."
1,I hope you get to feeling better soon! Nice builds!
1,It‚Äôs a good day
1,"Etho, your episodes always bring me joy no matter how gravelly your voice is. Hope all is well for you, that you get over your cold and that you take care! Thank you for all that you do! :D"
1,"To answer your question: yes, large companies DO mathematically decide what the best place for a sign will be. Even documents about Logos alone are often tens, if not hundreds of pages long."
1,"I like the new colors in the base, very Von Sway."
1,"it looks SO GOOD!!! 
please rest up and get better! <3"
212,"""I've got a smiley face! And he's got a headband like me!"" The way my face lit up omg this is so fun

also seeing you start using more interesting tech ‚Äî transitions (star wipe!), the book text overlays, freecam and now the flashback mod ‚Äî is neat.

Hope you feel better soon!"
1,"For the Ravager head, why don't you make the eyes glow? Either using green frog lights, or stained glass, with frog lights behind it, maybe?

Also your voice sounds horrible!
But not enough to detract from the video. Thanks for your effort and get well soon."

43,"21:08 Red, Yellow, Green, and in the reverse order ‚Äî just like the new life series trailer that came out today. This is either a neat coincidence or an incredibly subtle teaser by Etho!"
1,One day etho‚Äôs channel will be taken over by AI
0,So meta how his voice sounds more and more croaky as he's building the Ravager Rush exterior.
0,also etho rest well pleaseeee
0,"That entrance is amazing, it really gives off that pinball/arcade cabinet vibe"
0,for the prickles wall maybe brown or orange glazed terracotta might blend better in that space because it has a mixture of cyan and brown/orange
0,"The sign looks amazing and so do the ravagers, though I think they really need a darker color for the noses. Also the dark parts to the sides of the entrace look a bit like a mouth with those frog lights as teeth. :D"
0,Loved the video Etho!
0,Great episode etho!
0,At this point I wonder if Etho's family even knows he's Etho xD
0,Omg! Your voice was like someone was pinching your nose while sitting on your chest. Etho is your older siblings picking on you again? Haha
0,"For the villager room roof, why not try prismarine (especially the dark variant)? It would fit well with the blue copper but with a different texture and slightly different colour, plus you get slab and stair variants. I'd say either that or perhaps nether brick for a nice dark textured ceiling. I feel like prismarine has gotten severely overshadowed by other new blue blocks but it can still hold its own."
0,The voice change by the end is pretty wild. Surprisingly nasaly
0,"Loved the episode! Voice raspiness just adds to the personality don‚Äôt worry haha. Great segments, good transitions, enjoy your time with family!"
0,Happy :)

0,16:52 etho should play with scar and see who loses the most lol. i remember scar playing that and i think lost every round
0,This base is climbing up the list of all time Etho bases. I think it even has a chance to surpass the Monstrosity of season 7 as the best Etho Hermitcraft base ever
0,22:44  interesting colour choices. Almost reminds me of the life series colours... Interesting
0,Mangrove ceiling perhaps?
0,I think this is the closest Etho has ever come to having a completed base in Hermitcraft. Its almost uncanny.
1,Etho's voice progressively getting raspier throughout the video is so cute.
0,Get better soon Etho!

2,"I love the ""Speaking of llamas"" segue. Never gets old."
0,"Etho, you should make the ravagers mouths the same orange as that orange frog! So it looks like they've been snacking üòÇ"
0,"I like the ceiling in your villager room. I think it's cool with that rost gradient!
I think the copper support beams on the side are too much. if that would be a different block, then the ceiling could work better. (or maybe have that rusty feature on them too?)
And the floor looks too flat. Droping it a half slab down could already help or mimicing the shape of the ceiling and turn it into a tube? Then a secret way behind that painting would make a lot of sence too."
0,get well soon
0,"Fun fact, Companies do think about size of font!, when driving on a highway or interstate, you typically have 6-8 seconds to read a billboard. So 100% it‚Äôs a thing. Try it out next time."
0,"Thank you for the episode, Etho.  Get better!"
0,"17:02 that was a beautiful chord (dyad) on the word ""draw"" lol"
0,"I love the new entrance to Ravager Rush, it‚Äôs so perfect for the game and it‚Äôs the absolute perfect level of goofiness to bring joy to all who watch your videos! Hope you have some good ice lollies in the house to help your throat feel better."
0,Rock always wins
3,"Speaking of Llamas, hope you‚Äôre feeling better and you‚Äôre enjoying time with family! It‚Äôd be nice to see more ‚Äúhit record and see what happens‚Äù videos like this. I know YouTube trends say otherwise, but those early videos were so much fun and relatable. Anyway, about those llamas‚Ä¶"
10,I had a huge smile on my face the whole time you were building the exterior to ravager rush! I love SO much that the ravagers are in minecarts! And that Snake is included! Looks so good!
0,"Thank you for making time for us, I love the build!"
0,The ravages in the mine carts were a really cute touch üëç now someone please save this man dear god
0,"Hi Etho, hope you get better soon and have time to enjoy spending time with your family!
Seeing that you loved pixelmon so much I was wondering if you saw the mod cobblemon. And if yes if you ever plan on doing a series on this mod? It doesn't need to be something too serious, just as a fun filler series.
I absolutely loved when you played pixelmon and I'm not even a huge Pokemon fan.
Wishing you the best, man!"
0,Love the joke in the description asking if anyone‚Äôs found his voice. It‚Äôs always great to see Etho learning a new tool too.
2,ETHO! you're a real king for getting us an episode all the way through the end of it!!!  üò≠
0,8:03 Sad noises from all the viewers with singleplayer worlds.
0,Feel better Etho!
0,It would be cool if one of the frog statues at the front looked like Etho.
0,"boy, Etho's von sway has really evolved! üò± so has the voice hahaha"
0,"8:22 hmmm I got a sneaking suspicion that there IS a secret entrence in the painting, everyone knows u have to check the 2 sides of the 2x2 painting."
2,"I have been wondering all these years why you couldn't record when your voice was sick... At last I start to understand why, but unexpectedly, the more you were struggling the more relaxing it was to hear you talk! Maybe it kind of reminded me of your first lets play episodes that had slower pace and you were speaking lower...
I'm also impressed at how interesting you made this episode, even in just a day of recording. A lot of the ideas and features you exposed were very informative and gave a good update on your progress. Maybe you managed that because you have been thinking about it for a couple days and so it wasn't all exactly improvisation.
And also wow you now got your hands on some replay recording tool! I always feel concerned whenever you acquire some trait or software (video editing software instead of just fraps, optifine zoom, freecam mod, etc) that bring you closer to what a """"mainstream youtuber"""" (can't think of a nicer term, not meant to be mean) would use. It kind of feels like when growing up in a way: things are different, usually not in a bad way, but you kinda miss the good old times when things were simpler. I am always proud of how you prove that if the content is good, you don't need to enhance it with special effects and attention catching tricks, especially when you still manage to emulate these special effects simply by overachieving the game's mechanics (exposing descriptions using wooden signs, adding background music by building a note-block symphony, smoothing transitions by locating yourself at similar positions in between a jumpcut, etc). But I can understand if you say that you are too comfortable using the same workflow for years and now want to start playing with new tools!
I really appreciate that you spent your attention to deliver this video, and wish you good luck for the upcoming days you will get through! :)"
0,thank you for getting us another episode even being busy and sick! hope you're feeling better!
0,nice vid etho
0,YAYAYA I NEW ETHO VID :3
0,"7:53 would nether brick work? Too dark? Clashes too much? Idk


PS: hope you feel better soon!"
7,"I much prefer the flashback that you did with the natural, moving around as you're talking, sharp movements. It's different and cool. Cool in a surreal or wow kind of way. I can't really think of any other way to describe it."
4,3:45 signs of appreciation <3
0,I think you should have tried top slabs in front of the eyes
0,Love the build!! You‚Äôve grown a strong eye for design and creativity.
0,Who is this guy at the end of the video? Did Etho retire? üòÇ
0,Get better Etho!
0,The Ravager Rush sign looks SOOO good! Love the colors you picked
0,The Ravager Rush sign looks SOOO good! Love the colors you picked
0,Mojang should add TNT armor trim just for Etho.
0,If you placed dark oak arches in your trading area I think that would break up all the copper on the ceiling.
1055,"Honestly I gotta say I love the vibe of you in freecam while you're doing the building timelapse. A lot of building youtubers just kinda stick it on a smooth camera and then talk over it which, while it looks pretty, it doesn't really have much ""character"" to it. You actually flying around the scene and commenting on things as they happen bring a *lot* of life to the timelapse and really matches your overall style."
0,Watch the last 5 minutes of this video blindfolded and try to convince yourself  you're not on Docm77's channel
2,"The general rule for letter sizing is 1 inch in height for every 10 feet. If you're a üèà field away, 100 yards, then your sign should be 30 inches tall :)"
0,Miley cyrus by the end
0,"Totally random but with your new villager door, would right click equiping a chestplate wearing elytra open the door? Was wondering if the elytra coming off and chestplate going on would trigger it or if needs to be done in the inventory like you demonstrated."
0,Etho's voice almost transformed into iJevin's voice at the end.
0,Your color theory knowledge is insane and I love it so much. Always blown away by your stuff and it‚Äôs amazing how far you‚Äôve come.
1,"Interior looking as fantastic as the exterior etho‚Äîyou could try cherry leaves + stairs (maybe another transitional colour for the stairs if you don't like the copper) for the trading hall roof, since you have cherry saplings in pots in there and the new leaf animations would add some instant ambiance"
1,"Etho, your base is incredible! It looks good -- I love the variety of colors, it's so unique! -- and it has so many cool little machines! I absolutely LOVE it!"
5,"Your base is so cartoony in a wonderful way. I find the colors very harmonious.
My conscience says ""No Etho don't strain yourself to make videos while you're sick!"" but I can't lie I'm so happy you did. Made my day."
0,for the copper celing you could look back at bdubs s7 castle roof
0,Over a year on the server and he‚Äôs only at episode 15 üòÇ dang he‚Äôs really just moved on in life.
0,"Word on the street is if you shovel sand you're a sucker anyway, so ..."
2,"Yeah etho  think i agree, i was there for the man cave, but this is probably my favorite base you‚Äôve build or maybe even in general. So many incredible things in a smaller confined space that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice any of your incredible artistic vision. And this IS A work of art, don‚Äôt you say otherwise. It‚Äôs a culmination of all of the skill, work, and dedication you‚Äôve given this wonderful game/medium for a kind of art. Function, beauty, and fun, this base is."
0,Speaking of llamas‚Ä¶ ü¶ô üòÇ
0,"Etho, I enjoyed the episode, not despite your voice, but rather because it was your voice. However you are clearly sick and should rest (at least your voice). I'm sure we'll be here waiting for you however long it takes, so don't stress!"
0,etho you are so so silly never change
0,"Poor thing! Feel better soon, Etho. This was a great video and I loved the details you put into the interior of your base. The yellow looks so good with the blue. 

Ravager Rush exterior is so amazing, too! The expressions on the ravagers are so silly. I can't wait for the world download so I can play it myself!"
0,speaking of llamas hmmm
0,"This is my favorote video of yours in a long while, as strange as that may be. Slag the algorithm, make more 1-day-progress videos I say"
0,I love how etho was able to do the multiplication very easily but had a brain fart at the addition lol
0,My father in law designs signage for those big companies short answer yes many hours go into size and height for signage
0,"For the villager trading hall roof, I would probably go with granite, jungle, or mangrove if I'm feeling bold. All of these have medium saturation and brightness, which is what I think the roof needs."
0,Etho gradually evolving into Nebris by the end lol
0,In the trading hall I‚Äôd go with dark oak planks for at least the ceiling. I‚Äôm not sure about the stair block.
0,Hooray!!!
2,"With everything going on in our country, it‚Äôs nice to take 36 to think about nothing and enjoy an etho video. a small refuge of mental wellness in a chaotic world"
0,Thanks Etho ‚ù§
0,It looks so cool! Love love love what you made it into
0,"Your base is absolutely gorgeous! The color choice is so vibrant and exciting, and the work you put in for the faux lighting absolutely paid off. Great job!"
0,"As an Architect, in the US, each state uses a building code to distinguish the size of the signs. Yes, there are limitations to the size and how many you can put on your building. It‚Äôs pretty dumb."
12,"I think the three ravagers are just perfect for a recreation of that meme with the 3 headed dragon, where the right one is all goofy, the center is looking at the right one, judging it, and the left one is just menacing. Might be perfect to include it here, and you already got the side-looking one and would just need a goofier one :D"
1,"Hahaha awww ethos voice at the end, fantastic video man as always and don‚Äôt worry people love the sick raspy voice"
470,"13:04 ‚ÄúAnd I am very happy to tell you that, that we will eventually one day get it done‚Äù"
0,Thanks for the episode!!!
0,We got Etho for one day!!!!! Lets make the most of it
0,"Make sure you get plenty of rest now! Even if it means you are gone for longer, we will all be happier for you to be healthy!"
0,"First carti unlocks a new voice and now Etho, I like it"
0,"Hope you‚Äôre feeling better, Etho."
0,Man if his voice deteriorated anymore the video would have required subtitles.
0,"Oh etho your voice sounds painful, heal up my g"
0,Does anyone know how Etho got the Llamas to walk around Sandy City like that?
0,10/10 video as always. You got so much done despite family coming over and being sick. Get better soon!
0,change the warped wood to the cyan terracota
0,"""$30 Logitech mouse can't be beat"".  I genuinely thought he just kept the button pressed and the annoying broken double click spammed his way to victory üòÇ.




Jk, but it made me laugh üòÖ"
0,The almost-lost-voice etho triggered my 'clear throat' instinct!
0,I LOVE YOU ETHOOOO
64,"26:54 Reminds me of the moment in your LP series (it was episode 265) where you can't figure out why the hopper isn't draining, you spend a while troubleshooting, then you say ""surely it can't be that there's a lever under it,"" you check and see one there, pause, and say:
""...well, I'm scrapping this recording"" xD"
0,Etho sounds like docm at the end lol
0,get well soon etho !
0,"this video is so wholesome, i love the chill vibes"
0,"What a guy, Etho doin what he can to give us content"
1,"Feel better etho, we miss you always and appreciate you‚ù§"
0,"Gonna be back to normal ""WITHIN A FEW WEEKS""!!?? Etho, take care of yourself better and GWS in a few days dude!! :)"
0,"Hey Etho, hope you‚Äôre going to get well soon, are you going to bring back the modded series? Huge fan btw ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
0,I'm sorry that you have to deal with your fathers things for so long without seemingly any time to grieve. It's been so long already and you're still dealing with it
0,"love the building content and finishing projects! small note, i think the ravager noses should definitely be a different, darker colour than the rest of the face; on the actual ravager the nose is almost as dark as the unibrow

hope you feel better soon!"
0,"If you need to figure out which armor trim is which, stop over to Docs armor trim shop!"

0,this was a great episode
0,Speaking of llamas‚Ä¶
0,"Thanks Etho for suffering through this to bring us entertainment.
Get well soon."
0,"I know ""Speaking of llamas"" is prob'ly some old Etho and Beef lore, but I only know it from Milo Murphy's Law."
0,Building a froggy shop with a froggy voice? What's the issue?
0,Had me thinking you'd completed the upstairs thenüòÇ
0,"8:20
The ceiling looks good imo, but its the fully oxidized copper which stands out too much, the rest is nice.
Consider replacing the fully oxidized copper sections with some other block, I'd think polished blackstone could look good."
0,Why is raspy etho hot???
0,"loved the epsode, etho, but next time, get yourself into shape before doing it :D"
0,Seeing etho learning flashback is great.
1,"Hey Etho, I‚Äôve never commented on the channel before I don‚Äôt think but I‚Äôve watched you a long time and this video really helped me offset how I was feeling. I had 2 grandparents, my grandmother and great grandmother pass away recently so it was a heavy emotional blow. I hope you get to feeling better soon, thank you for having a happy and energetic tone ‚ù§"
0,"ETHOOO, whenever you have the chance, can you release the final decked out 2 runs of burning dark? Rewatching do2 was such a blast I love the content you do. I'm just one of many subscribers, so there's no need to listen to me. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
0,Get well soon and take your time Etho!
0,"The interior is looking good! The pops of color definitely work and gives it character it would lack if it was all the same colors. For the roof over the villagers, maybe you can add yet another color? Nobody can miss the Ravager Rush game now, it's fun and dynamic. You nailed the cartoon vibe. And now (as much as I snorted when your voice squeaked out of nowhere), go rest your voice, mister! Hope you feel better soon."
0,Sounding like Nebris towards the end there
0,froggy vibe all the way
0,"I liked Etho‚Äôs hair today, did he get a haircut?"
0,I think warped wood or dark oak could be nice for that ceiling
0,"Loved the home interior!  Those blue/green spots are a nice addition, I think.

Ravager Rush exterior is also looking good.  Those ravagers add a lot to the fun feel.

Take care of yourself, Etho!  Gargle with salt water, keep hydrated, stay rested as much as you‚Äôre able."
0,"Def did super well for being sick, I know that sick voice feeling well it's so hard to talküò¢"
35,The moment you stepped back at the eyebrow temp build I giggled and knew it was perfect
2,Was admiring the little blue pattern wall when you said you didn't like it
0,Never clicked on a video this fast in my entire life
494,"6:50 Etho, have you been SHOVELLING sand!? Don't you know that's for suckers?"
0,GET WELL SOON ETHO! was still amazing to watch regardless :3 i will always be a sucker for your functional but decorative redstone in your bases.
0,"tbh i didn't even notice the ""speaking of llamas!"" thing until i looked at the comments lol"
0,Hope you get better soon.. üíö
1,"3:20 I love this trophy! It would be awesome if you could add some splash text (maybe on the sign, or the trophy itself) saying that you ""ate up all the bugs"" or something like that, as a reference to the frogs"
0,Great episode hopefully you feel better soon :) . I find for villager trades pumpkins and melons are a great option to get emeralds as I can set up a farm and have it running whenever I'm at the base
2,"etho, by the end of this video, you sound like your on your last leg, rest up that voice! so when you get back, we can all rejoice in your amazing voice!"
0,Take care of yourself.
0,"Ravager Rush remind me less of a shop and more of a carnival ride with how elaborate the theming is, I love it!"

33,12:13 Check out the armor trim shop!! I think it's docs but you can pick any template and armor (from what I remember) and that way you don't need to do too much work going through them all :)
0,great video!
0,Speaking of Llamas with no bright blue bamboo?? what is this!?
0,"I got the notification for this video while stuck at work, but I was so so happy to finish my shift and come home to watch. Sorry you haven‚Äôt been well, but the base and ravager rush are both looking great. I absolutely love the light baking you‚Äôve been experimenting with, but I definitely understand not making it your standard given the amount of effort it takes. Thanks so much for the upload (despite the raspy voice!) it made my day."
0,have a good time with ur family and rest up when u can. we‚Äôll see u when ur ready :)

1,The interior and ravager rush look great!
0,"that clock is quite cool etho, and the fact that it works is the best.

other than that hope that you get well soon,  at the very end your voice was really failing, but good building all in all, i do like the ravagers, the one looking to the side and down is my favourite"
0,Such a good episode. Loved the builds. Hopefully you can get sime rest and have a nice family time! The Voice reminded me of earyer episodes
31,"35:42 ""Parking lights"" ..yeah...."
0,"Get better soon Etho! Just binged Project Ozone 2 and loved it. I hope you'll consider another modded series when you get some more free time. Would love to see a long play of Gregtech New Horizons if you're up for another challenge. It has a thorough quest book, but I understand if the completionist in you would see the scale of content and not bother."
0,Regarding the Emerald door mechanism: Am I missing something or can't Etho simply hover his mouse over an armor piece and double click to open the door? (Unequip and equip again)
8,Aw man get well soon! the voice by the end was tragic - I've just recently gotten over a similar level of tragic voice syndrome so you have my deepest sympathies and TRULY hope you get better soon Etho
0,An etho video of just him trying the different trims but as like a shopping montage
0,Flashback looks useful. I have to record from my alt account using it as a camera. Was looking for something better that doesn't eat my GPU and kill my frames.

0,"Loved the episode, take care of yourself <3"

hope you get better soon etho"
6,In a weird way I actually really enjoyed footage of you using flashback to fly around in the sped up timelapse.  Sort of meta.  I think that is a perspective we never get to see and it was really cool.  I would not complain if you find a way to do that sort of thing well.
0,speaking of llamas
15,"Etho you‚Äôre an absolute trooper! I love how you just persisted to make a great quality Etho episode that had me smiling all the way through it despite you being sick.

0,"Dude, do you have that persistent cough that's going around? I've been on my butt for close to two weeks. Smoke isn't helping either. So tired  D:"
1,Great video as always. Feel better soon. Really love how you used Flashback for this video. Still feels like we are following you around (which I love) and now we get to see more of your process. Thanks for everything.

1,"The new front of RR looks so good wth. You were flying with progress in one day, nothing like a quick deadline to get the juices flowing lol. Get well soon! ‚ù§"
0,ive been watching for years now and i think this is the sickest youve ever sounded on camera hahah feel better soon etho
1,5:35 is there a reason you can't just take off and put back on the same piece of armor really fast? why do you need to do two different ones in that pattern lol
0,Those ravagers turned out so good! Hope you get better soon.
0,"back again to say you should name your rock shop ""Rock Bought-'Em"" when you go back to it!"
1,"Such an awesome video!!!  I really love the cartoony take on the ravagers, and the goofy faces definitely give them a lot of character! I feel like with every video your building and ""style"" just get more and more artsy and impressive, it's really awesome to see. Even if you don't incorporate the ""light baking"" trick into your regular style, it's still helping with conscious colour choices which will only further other parts of your style. It also just looks really cool in this base haha. It's evident there's a good amount of care and consideration being put into colour and compositions... the front of Ravager Rush looks seriously incredible. Looks so fun and it's just filled with so much personality. Keep up the great work Etho and feel better soon!!"
0,"the little ravagers on the building are sooo cute! giving them different expressions and full bodies were definitely a good decision! the gradient/scene you did on the stained-glass background of the logo is an idea im definitely stealing, details like that really makes the whole thing even more special beyond its aesthetics.

you experimenting with the replay mod is a nice surprise and i look forward to more footage you come up with in the future!!! thank you so much for the video, i had to pause my architecture work just to focus on this LOL

0,Was I the only one that thought those pink stripes on the back of the ravagers were something else? Like before he zoomed out to show the carts...üòÇ
0,18:30
16,"Something I want to call out. I know a lot of hermits use the fly cam to look at things, and I know Etho has used it previously as well. But one thing I've gotten a little tired of hearing is ""ok folks, now I'm going to use cheaty cam..."". This is the first time (at least in a long time) that I've seen a hermit use fly cam without calling it ""cheaty"". It's so so so nice to not hear that line and to see this tool getting used like it's a normal tool that most people are aware of and not some hack that you've secretly installed against your server mates wishes.
In the past I've heard Etho talking about how hard/scary it can be for him to make changes to this channel. I like this. I really liked seeing the flashback footage as well. I think both of those are good changes that will give Etho more freedom to record things how he wants.
Personally I find I can get a better sense of where things are when a fly cam goes through a wall vs having a cut and being told ""now we are on the other side of that wall"""
0,Oh Etho! Thank you for the episode and pushing through despite the illness. Hope you recover quickly!
1,Get well soon Ergo!

great efforts, and hope you recover soon!"
0,I enjoyed the video
0,The voice sounds almost a little uncanny in this episode. It's like imposter etho has taken over
30,Back when i needed him most (I‚Äôve got the big sad and etho helps distract from bad thoughts)
2,"Aww Etho, you're sounding so sick. Rest well and take your time to recover. I hope all goes well with your family."
0,In the almost decades I have been watching your videos...I have never heard your voice so rough...thanks for toughing it out for us!
1442,"Despite the time crunch and the sickness, this episode was a perfect encapsulation of what makes an Etho video great (other than of course Etho himself). He demonstrates some cool redstone concepts and how he has implemented them; walks us through his thought process on the colors in his house; has some great banter with friends; and then does a wonderful building segment where you feel involved in the process and learn a few things along the way to implement yourself. Even showing the behind the scene footage of learning the Playback system makes you as a viewer feel like you are watching something more real and achievable yet inspiring."
0,i love the fun colored walls !
1,"Etho please play Vintage Story, it is like TerraFirmaCraft but its own polished game. Got it myself like 2 weeks ago because of Gem and already have around 60 hours in my world, it is such an exciting immersive experience, feels like playing minecraft for the very first time!
Also it has been a while since we got some Cooking with Etho ^^"

0,Feel better soon Ergo :)
1,"oh poor etho, drink some tea!"
0,"Great episode, I hope you feel better soon, I do think that the ravengers would look better with the moved over one block onto the sides of the faces personally but they look great!"
12,"Etho.... just thank you so much for being you, and making so many awesome videos for us over the years. You are by far the only youtuber I could ever call my favorite! You have brought me so many smiles and good moments, I'm sure millions of other people feel this way too. You truly make the world a better place."

Purpur! 

A nice homage Pearl's helpful roof from earlier in the Season."
0,"I think the copper ceiling in the villager trading room in your house is fine, but maybe the floor needs to be redone and it‚Äôll make the ceiling look better."
0,I think the Ravagers could do with a half slab or something over the nose. Maybe change the nose color to something that sticks out a bit from the rest
3,"I think this video exemplifies the reason why Etho has such a loyal fanbase, he doesn't cut out the voice cracks and bloopers and he's so unapologetically himself. There's a reason why after 10 years I still get excited when Etho posts a new video. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. Slab. <3"
0,I love the alcove with prickles in it. It's a nice accent alcove üòä

Good stuff regardless"
0,"At the start of the episode I didn't understand the title. About half way through I got it... Get well soon Etho!
Also that shop is looking snazzy! I really like what you did on the roof!"
1,"Wow, Etho finally found a use for those shiny blue rocks @12:24"
0,Etho ‚Äî I think you need to tweak the ravager on the left so his eyes are pointing the other way. That way itll look like it's glaring menacingly at the player as you enter the game. The the exterior will be perfect üòÇ

1,"Talking about Llamas, get well soon Etho üòä"
0,"I agree with Bdubs, you sound good. The only reason I don't want to hear your voice like this is because you should be resting it instead of stressing an already strained vocal tract. Hope you're well again."

get well soon Etho! i'm sick today too... in a different way, but hey, i can commiserate!"
0,"The Ravager Rush sign kind of looks like a giant mouth, with the brown columns on either side as legs. You should put the rest of a ravager head on top it would be like a throwback to decked out"

0,great episode... but now: rest your voice please so you can make another episode soon
11,"I was curious how long I've been subscribed to Etho for,  May 17th,  2013.  I've been watching your videos for over 12 years now.  I'm 40 years old and I still enjoy watching every video.  Thanks for being awesome Etho!"

0,The contrast between his voice at the start of the episode and the end is Crazy!
1,Someone needs to make a horn of the saying at 18:30!
0,I recommend for the ravenger using slabs for the unibrow (half way on the eye and halfway off) to excentuate how large the forehead is! that and potentially making their nose out of mud!
0,Mabye tuff for the ceiling?
0,"I KNOW that ethos villager trading jingles are from an old video game, but I can't put my finger on it. I thought it was Punch Out, but it's not exact.

0,"Love how this season especially, your lets play base building style is very much on display. Always dug the blend of aesthetic and functionality"
0,i think mangrove planks and trapdoors could make a nice panelled ceiling for the villager room!
7,"I've been watching your old project ozone videos lately, it's astounding how much progress you've made with building over the past few years!! I teach violin lessons, and when people ask me if their kid is like talented or whatever, like if they're going to be any good, I try to explain that talent is the least part of it, it's all just layers of skills that can be learned if you have the drive and direction, it's so much more about whether you love to make progress and problem solve and you love the process of working at it. They usually don't believe me lol, and sometimes it's hard to believe it yourself when you get a lot of eye rolls for saying it, but it's absolutely true, and you're absolutely confirmation. It gives me so much confidence with perservering with things I never imagined I would be any good at, like programming, drawing, building, and redstone. I absolutely love your videos, completely inspiring."
0,5:24 is there a reason his boots don‚Äôt have throns?
9,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done

0,25:00 I always wondered what Minecraft YouTubers used to make those timelapses
1,31:44 HE MINED THE CLAY!!!
1,I just want to know does Ethos extended family know he's Ethoslab? Or is he known as the Rug Guy?
2,"I love seeing the interior of the base come together. It's reassuring to know that it's a style of building that also takes you a long time to complete. I was frustrated with my own progress because it takes forever to finish a small space.

Also very cool to see your process for designing the exterior of Ravager Rush. I think it is a good idea to put in the big elements and then design the rest of the exterior to support them instead of the other way around."
1,"As somebody who plays modded minecraft the most, that sign you made for Ravager Rush would look really good with the font blocks being vertical slabs. The slight pop out would look really good, unfortunately it's not available in vanilla."
237,"""I like innies (not talking about Bellybuttons)"" Etho, man of culture, 2025"
1,"Thanks for willing this episode out as you got sick haha. Personally I love your montages from your perspective as you build, not the free form camera sped up building you see from so many creators these days. It feels a lot less like we‚Äôre playing with you and more just like an overproduced piece of content with those ‚Äúdrone shot‚Äù building montages. Just a note from a big fan!"
4281,"Etho's voice slowly deteriorating is slightly hilarious, I know Bdubs is gonna have a field day with this, genuinely so impressed with how much you've got done, good luck with another busy week!"
5,"I am learning a lot about building from this episode! At 26:09 is where I noticed Etho sounding under the weather; his voice seemed normal to me until then. I wish you a swift recovery, Mr. Slab!
(Note: I accidentally sent the comment when writing the second sentence, which is why why it is edited.)"
5,"Feel better Etho! Love the content as always, been missing you. Always bring joy to my life!"

0,ROCK ALWAYS WINS! üçª
25,"I think the speedy lines next to ‚Äúrush‚Äù might look cool as a different color. They make it slightly harder to read ‚Äúrush‚Äù and it could be a good opportunity to tie in some contrast or frame/grab attention.

Love the video as always and best of luck continuing to work through your father‚Äôs stuff.

Edit: after seeing the finalized product, it think it totally works with the same colored speed lines."

46,"For the ceiling above the villager room I have a few ideas; what if you switched out the upper copper (not the beams) with dark oak stairs/trapdoors and maybe a few alternating redstone lamps? It could match the dark oak end wall. Alternatively some warped planks/stairs could look cool as like a darker version of the copper being in shadow. Or, if you wanted to be crazy, cherry planks to compliment the little cherry trees in pots, though that would be obnoxious lol"

Then we get to see Ravager Rush getting decked out!   Too much fun.   Been watching since my kiddo introduced me (back into) Minecraft years ago now.  Still always look forward to what my favorite redstoner/adventurer is up to.
4,8:14 use more copper not less! It‚Äôs almost giving sewer pipe vibe with the roof and length and you could do the rest to that theme. I like the idea of the villagers hiding in the sewers

0,Literally nothing like an etho episode to make a rough day better <3
0,How to turn a bad day into a good day
0,"Hey Ergo, I had this great idea for a game you could make in the Hermitcraft server. You can at least consider it, I think this would fit your chaotic mindset. On top of that I build this game in survival on my server and it was a lot of fun. I called the game Warden Wave. Essentially, all players are put into an arena on top of a mountain, and down below Wardens are constantly spawning from a shrieker and every minute or so an extra Warden arrives in the arena. In theory, this can go to an infinite amount of Wardens. The players are constantly sneaking trying not to make sound, but PVP is allowed, and players can punch each other to create noise. Similar to Decked Out, pressure plates are on the ground to make it more difficult. Snow balls are dispensed randomly across the arena to allow players to distract the Wardens. And after doing some parkour you can get swift sneak pants. Also all across the arena there are many traps, like iron trapdoors and piston traps that you can use to drop Wardens far below if they chase you, but the Wardens will after a while rejoin the arena. The arena should not be too big, and at some point there will be so many Wardens, and players will be punching each other and then they will start falling, until one is left, and when the last player dies the game detects it and gives him a diamond.  Again, playing this with friends was a lot of fun, and I think this fits your style. But of course you can decide yourself. The only problem is getting rid of the Wardens..."
83,14:09 the smiley face!! I love it hahaha

0,"I wonder if doing YouTube for well over a decade has allowed Etho to bypass voice loss when sick? I don't think he sounds any different.

I know a guy who worked radio for years and years and years before he moved to where I live. He got a horrible, nasty respiratory infection that, according to his doctor, should have rendered him unable to talk... but constantly using his voice made it strong, or something like that?"

1093,Why didnt you use a dispenser to load the water column with healing potions?
0,etho can you please play the long dark its a survial game based in canada it seems i think you really like it and its all about being alone and survival the cold canadian wilderness
0,Does anyone know what gold farm this is? I cannot find it in Etho's prior videos. Thank you
0,"Idk how u play with no leg spaces, look at those drawers ankle smashers."
0,"etho, great setup I like it but I gotta ask, what do you use the 2nd and 3rd monitors for???"
0,Seeing Etho's setup is wild. Bro has 2.6m subscribers and has some of the cheapest peripherals I've ever seen
0,"6:13 I've just noticed you have a peavey amp tucked in a shelf under your pc/ fan box thingy (sorry, idk too much about pcs lmao,) are you a guitarist?"
0,"20:10 wait a minute etho, you still have a hard drive even though you upgraded your PC??? you really should consider getting an M.2 drive. They're not expensive now."
0,etho clock is not working anymore :(
0,DID YOU BUY NEW HEADPHONES ???!?!?!?
0,God is good trust Him amen ‚ù§
0,"I know you like to play the game vanilla. But still, I would highly recommend checking out the Nvidium fabric mod. Would work perfectly with your hardware and give an insane boost to your framerate. Also easily allowing a 32+ chunk render distance with no issues (as long as you don't run out of (V)RAM). I play with 64 chunks no issues."
0,suckers still using Windows
0,I would watch you play a super hostile map in any format. Also 1 off videos are great. You‚Äôre the reason I found don‚Äôt starve which ended up being one of my favorite games for a few years
0,"an rtx 4060 is honestly garbage to be honest Etho. a rtx 4080 is almost %50 faster and is only about %25 more, and would serve you much better going into the future. i understand your mindset is its enough for you NOW, but in the future, id recommend upgrading to a rtx xx70 or above, to get your moneys worth, just to give you an idea how bad the 4060 really is, its about the same performance as a rtx 3070 LAPTOP GPU, which is equivalent to a rtx 20800 super.... atleast when comparing benchmarks"
0,"Hey @etho, im 29yrs old now, i 1st watched your video when i was 1st year college and im still watching today! 

please notice my comment"
0,vechs made a new superhostile relatively recently and I'd love to see it played
0,I see that ampüòèüòâ
0,"Because I was curious.. all though someone else may have also been this curious.. when you pressed F3 at 9:43 I noticed you've survived 14,530 Minecraft days... And because I'm so curious, I did math for once and calculated that you've spent 201 real world hours in this game world... Which is equivalent to 8 days, or 0.06% of your life :) 

Love you Etho! Thank you for making my days so much brighter! (Hopefully I didn't give you a pre-mid life crisis)"
0,unreal how much i learn from these videos
0,update your setup uncüò≠üò≠
0,Etho you should build a zoo in your world lol
0,Will there be a download of the map?
0,I remember watching episode 1 when I was 11-12 years old. I'm about to be 26.
0,Youtuber with 2.58mil subs using a RTX 4060. We love a humble king

0,"aww, I miss the super hostile stuff too. Team canada as well. :)"
0,Etho only  now getting with windows 11 and windows 12 will be out soon üòÇ
1,"Hey Etho! I'm not sure you'll see this with how old this video is, but I've been watching your LP series now for the first time, one episode a day, and I'm finally all caught up! Now i get to wait with everyone else for a new episode"
0,"Agreed, I enjoy your long form videos, have been watching on and off since ep01. you truely are an OG."
0,Etho will you be doing a world download for episode 600?? Also do you have any plans to maybe change the man cave a little with some of the new blocks
0,"Hey Etho, long time viewer here! I am curious if there is a reason you don't change the amount of allocated ram. It is something you can do easily in the Minecraft launcher settings and even changing from 4 gigs to 8 gigs can make a significant difference in high entity regions. all the best Mr Big Willy <3"
0,Mojang should add poison dart frogs to the jungle lol.
0,Its an extremely rare occurrence when Mr.Etho puts a real life picture in the videos. Did not expect that one today
0,"We love you Etho, just keep enjoying life and we shall be happy (:"
0,I'm glad you got a new pc! The frames have to feel way better than previously
0,"Man i miss the OOGE days, i rewatch those all the time lol"
0,Dude that snow on the end island is historical the fact that that snow has been in your world for years after you summoned those snow golems is incredible
0,"29:30 if they're all one tap why bother with healing II? I'm sure there's a good reason, just wondering if someone could explain."
0,6:06 etho do you play guitar?
0,"I played Legendary recently, expecting it to be brutally hard since I remember watching OOG struggle with it so much. It was surprisingly tame and easy! I think we've all developed greater minecraft skills in the over a decade since that map released."
0,"I also remember the super hostile videos and I agree that they were fun to watch!
Another thing that could be fun would be a tech mod pack playthrough, at least up to a point. Those packs can be a bit long winded but I generally like seeing your process of figuring things out and building cool stuff in the process."
0,"You're so cool Etho. Your pc set up looks so humble yet you've provided us with so much entertainment over the years. Wish I was more like you in many ways. Thank you for being a consistent bastion of comfort for me, and many others."
0,"I miss the one off videos. Those were some of my favs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love everything you do, but the one offs or even the short series like Sam and Max were super enjoyable"
1,"should have gotten an X3D processor, nothing beats it for gaming."
0,Your jittery mouse movement makes more sense after seeing the mouse you use lol. I love the chill vibes of your setup.
0,"Hey Etho, I know you've mentioned in videos in the past that you like Stardew Valley, well there is a newish Minecraft modpack called Society Sunlit Valley. It's like Stardew in Minecraft, super cool. You should check it out!"
0,"today I had no other option, so I put my mic in a tissue box. it works perfect. I feel like I should be mad but its just too convenient. you win, etho, it's not unhinged at all."
0,I see you have a peavy amp there! I didn‚Äôt know you played guitar? That‚Äôs awesome! I love music too! Cheers!
0,"please dont start making brain rot garbage 4 hours cut down to 10 minutes for the mentally challenged. They dont want to watch your videos, and we dont want to watch that."
0,"If the Zombie Piglins are 1 hit from death, why do you need Instant Health 2 Potions?"
0,Just watched your Project Ozone 2 series for the first time and loved it. Have you thought about doing another modded series? If you do I hope you try out a long play like Gregtech New Horizons which has an amazing quest book and years of content.
0,üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
0,"Etho, could you do both? Edit the video and make it a short series like maybe 1 episode like you said or maybe up to 8. Then release the full unedited version for people that prefer that or want to also watch that?"
0,Superhostile was a blast to watch back in the day!
0,"got re-recommended this video, and now realized you said something about windows 11

etho, the problem isnt the layout, it might be annoying to move over from, but the main issue is software incompatibility and the AI-nightmare systems that cause GIGANTIC and GLARING security issues... to the point where they can basically negate any and all precautions you can take to avoid having your data be stolen or be ransomed, and even some viruses from being installed

it has to deal with copilot and the new ""recall"" feature
the first iteration of recall, released to the public, had ZERO security, it noted where EVERYTHING was (including passwords) in a plain-text file, including the content of the files (yes, those passwords). it did this so that it could more easily tell you what it could do

but, the problem is that it mainly did a lot of ""phoning home"" which meant it could be extremely suceptible to a MITM attack, where someone intercepts the packets, and given the way its designed, there is no way to even prevent such an attack, because this system works against your will and in the background, and takes rather predictable routing patterns

they say they have fixed it, but many doubt they have"
0,THE GOAT üêê
0,I would love to see you start a new world from scratch. Would you ever do this?
0,I miss the slower content with OOGE and Team Canada. Its a shame the kids don't have attention for it anymore.
0,Hey Etho. I see that peavey amp on the shelve next to your desk. Do you play guitar or do you use it for something else?
2,Hello Etho. I have a trick to teach. The trick basically deletes the water in a bubble column but doesn't get rid of the bubbles. So you can use the column without water flowing everywhere. To do it basically place powder snow on every bubble column block and then place water at the top to delete the snow. Then       get rid of the water at the top and your done. Hope you read this! :)
0,"can't you just remove the bottom part of the orange glass column in the middle of the drop area? that way the potions should hit all the pigmen, no?"
0,he don't miss
0,I love the super hostile series idea. I was thinking about those maps recently but couldn't remember what they were called lol. I'm really happy to hear about them again!
0,Legendary is one of my favorite etho series! Would love to see you play it again. <3
0,"You should build a simple log cabin or something around the brewing set up. Just something quick in 30 minutes to make it feel more complete, even if you only see it like twice a year. Lovely episode as always :)"
0,I think for the super hostile edit to work you might need to edit an overview with a voice over to help guide the viewer when you jump around. I've seen you do it when there's lost audio or when you forget to record a clip.
0,"Hey Etho, you talked about playing maps in this video, would you ever consider livestreaming? I feel like this form of content delivery lends itself well to this style of playing Minecraft."
0,Etho is the minecraft equivalent of outdoorboyz
1,An important note on the Super Hostile thing; a huge part of why those were so enjoyable was you playing with the other guys. You playing through one solo wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting.
1,Those CTM map videos were so awesome.
0,"I would love to watch some super hostile maps, personally would watch full playthroughs but edited now is better than no video at all.  One video for a map seems like we would miss too much (unless its a LONG video) but maybe a short series, maybe a couple wools per video"
0,Love the quilt
1,"Off the back of your comment of the day I went back and re-watched your canopy carnage LP. it's still a fun watch and really great to settle in and watch, though the map doesn't hold up at all it's so early on in MC that it still had a real sense of wonder. Not being able to sprint or have stackable food just changes the combat so so much and adds a lot of tension. 

Whilst I understand the shift to longer, more progress filled content and love your LP and hermitcraft episodes, I also miss those less editing, lower effort longer series you used to do. I realise that the lower effort stuff can tank a channel's viewership - and a second channel isn't really your style I'd image, but if they could come back in some form that would be awesome.

Specifically for CTMs, if you play legendary you should definitely play it in beta 1.7.3 if you still want it to feel brutal - the map just isn't really balanced for post adventure update even though a 1.2.5 version does exist, it's not the same. For a newer map to try, I released a map a couple of years ago called The Trials of Beldroth, so I'd personally love to see you play that one in some form :P"
0,Hey Etho could you do a house tour
0,goat etho
0,Plz do rl craft ethoooo i been watching since ep1 lp
0,"We need more Etho, you‚Äôve got to live stream or something"
1,Should have gone ryzen
0,Hey etho. I recall you talking about being relatively physically active some time ago. Is the gym still one of your hobbies? Do you have other hobbies? I‚Äôm finding myself increasingly consumed in work and it‚Äôs becoming a little difficult to separate myself from the daily grind to support myself. How do you balance maintaining hobbies from work?
1,What about Team Canada!! With CTM maps those where golden ^^
0,"Etho, there is any chance for a modded series to come back?"
0,"ages will pass, but hopper clock will never be forgotten"
0,"I normally have bad attention span and not be able to watch videos longer than 10 minutes but somehow Etho videos are an exception, I watched the entire video through and in the end was confused that how quickly 30 minutes passed by"
0,"i havent seen you in three or four years

youre still amazing. thank you"
0,Do you still play Guitar with that peavy amp???
0,I'd love to watch another super hostile map. Go for it!
1,algorithm
0,"Hey Etho, not sure if you would be open to it but you could live stream the super hostile map and then release a video with all the highlights."
0,Dwarves vs dragons my beloved
0,Baby come back
0,"You should take a page from RTgame's lets plays for longform gameplay, as RT does handle a lot of the smaller games he plays like that."
0,"Re superhostile maps, I remember enjoying your Legendary the most because you spent time building in it, not just clearing for the wool. Given what you said about people watching minecraft for creative ideas, this seems to track... food for thought maybe?"
0,"Also regarding the comment of the day,  I know its unlikely, but it is something you could do for members only but I do not know how exclusive videos interact with the statistics/algorithm of the channel in general if it would be viable. Of course, there are also a lot of people who simply do not have the money to spent on a channel membership and they would be locked out. So another idea would be unlisted videos (here again idk how they interact with the algorithm for your channel) and post the link on community posts."
0,"26:11 was that optifine zoom? not something i would have expected to see in the LP

ohh just FOV, I see"
0,"I'm a relatively new subscriber and just started watching through the old superhostile/ctm map series you've done, and I loved them! They're so fun to watch. And personally, the slower pace is actually one of the reasons this is my favorite channel to watch. The fast paced/short attention span/jumping around video style is harder for me to follow and keep up with. I think it would be great if you did another superhostile, even if it's only one video, but I'd gladly watch the whole entire thing too!"
0,"Hi Etho! I couldnt help but notice your amp to the right of your desk in the picture you showed off of your setup. Do you happen to play guitar or some other sort of instrument? You've always been quite skilled at making songs with noteblocks, so I've always wondered if you were a musician. I'd love to know!"
1,"Hey Etho! The world tour is coming up and I was wondering if you've ever thought of touring some of the Hermits around your world? Gem and Scar recently toured fWhip's hardcore world and it seemed like a really fun time! I know the series is singleplayer, so it might work better as a stream or recording separate from the Episode 600 world tour, but I know a lot of people would love watching it!"
0,Really really excellent video. Adore this contraption
0,Hey Etho! You should do another play through of terrafirmacraft !üëÄ
0,"19,000 likes vs just SIXTEEN (16) dislikes on this video. That's an incredible ratio, we all love you!! <3"
0,"Is there a reason to bother making the potions Healing II? If you got the Pigmen all down to one-hit death, wouldn't a non-buffed standard Healing potion have the same effect?"
0,Nice amp
0,"You should do an episode where you show the world with shaders and a texture pack just to see how differnt it might look, just a curious thought"
1,"Hey Ergo, I would love to see you play another modded series, especially with that new setup. Let me know what you think"
0,"About your answer to the comment of the day, 
A way to keep the narrative consistent would be adding a bit of a voice over in certain parts, it could make more digestible a harsher cut, maybe?"
0,"Would you be open to streaming the super hostile maps? With no need to focus on chat ofc, but since there tends to be a lot happening durin ghtem I feel like they might be a fit?"
0,"Hi Etho, regarding your new PC, is your CPU affected by the oxidation issue that have been reported on Intel 13th and 14th gen chips?"
0,I love you ethooo
0,Ethos could have been in the Minecraft movie and we would never know it was him.
0,"Hi Etho, love your videos, And have you ever looked at Vintage story as it's similar to terra firma craft?"
0,Saw the tissue box mic. Smashed like.
0,intel lmao
0,I think an edited down adventure map would be fun! But don't take out too much! A 3+ hour video would be wonderful ü§≠ I'd bring my snacks
0,Look up: I 100% ‚Äúgame name‚Äù it‚Äôs a whole genre on YouTube now. You could use that style for a MC map or something similar. It‚Äôs more of an edited walkthrough with lots of scripted voiceover from post production. I‚Äôm not sure it would fit your style but I‚Äôm sure u could find a way
0,"Etho I have been watching you since 13 years ago and I've grown and changed in this period, how have you grown and changed in this long time period?"
0,"Just because I haven‚Äôt seen any other comments mention it, I‚Äôm pretty sure the ‚Äúprojectile shoot‚Äù option on the sculk sensor will detect you throwing the splash water bottles into the system"
0,"I had my first vivid dream in quite a while last night: Etho and the other hermits had a Mario Kart double dash tournament and don't remember who won but etho waffled about the game design a lot.

Don't know what that says about me that that's what I dream about."
1,I‚Äôd never heard of an entity separator - that‚Äôs ingenious. Thanks for sharing and explaining it! So cool we‚Äôre still learning new stuff about this 15 year old game üòÑ
0,peavy amp you play bass etho???
0,yayyy more etho!!
0,Love that you kept the tissue box and updated us on it as well as the office tech update! Love irl etho lore
0,For how much money etho makes off of these video. I feel like his setup would be more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù aka mic arm.
0,Etho you deserve a nice set up :)
2,"No offense, Etho, but I'm not a number! I like older-style videos because that's the style I like. I know there aren't many of us, but if you chopped it up into a shorter video, I'd definitely be less inclined to watch.

But in the future, please do not assume that because the views are lower, that ""nobody"" likes different things...... Do you not remember the spaghetti sauce research???"
0,i would love to watch you do a vault hunters series
0,I wish Windows 11 has a Windows 10 mode
0,Separate speakers from PC on desk. Now thats retro.
0,editing things down would be fun
0,Would you consider playing Vintage Story with Gem?
0,"You can hold looting sword in offhand to get the effect, so you can still do other things with your main hand"
0,Stream the whole hostile map playthrough and pay a editor to sort through the highlights. People that enjoy long form will get the VOD. People that enjoy shorter form will get the YouTube highlight ü§å
0,Why not just stream it? It seems like the obvious solution.
0,"etho: * gets a new computer *
also etho: * still uploads in 1080p *"
0,"Hi Etho,
I get that you and your style of videos is evolving but I do not agree with your idea that you always have to make progress in an episode. Looking back you took 5 episodes to finish an overly complicated sheepfarm and people loved it :)
I get that that was a huge project at the time and this one is small in comparision (and also you already showed off automatic brewing before). But I still feel like I am being robbed of Etho content. Like you are taking forever for episodes because you have the feeling that you have to deliver a big project with a brilliant new idea every episode which results in you doing a lot of stuff off camera. Maybe this is just me imagining stuff and you are actually enjoying this content more in which case I am all for it. All I want to say is I'd also watch an episode of you polishing up the mancave or one of your obscure bases. Maybe I wouldnt love it but without 'average' videos as a baseline it's getting harder to appreciate the insane amount of creativity you offer in your videos that I love so much.

Enough rambling, thanks for the years of amazing entertainment anyways :)"
0,"Hello Etho ,what is your new monitor ?"
0,talking about your new office setup made my day <3
1,26:33 why is your mc just running on 4gb of ram??
0,I‚Äôd be interested to hear your opinion on steam OS
0,Fascinating
0,"""i have to make progress in the episodes or theyll feel empty""
Unless the editing is a huge pain, i think we'd be okay with getting 2 or 3 episodes over a week whenever you find time to film"
0,"Definitely enjoy getting to participate in the build in the first half of the episode (been missing that a little bit, haha), makes me feel like I know what's going on a bit more (and feel a bit more invested in the build as well).
As far as the adventure map, editing that much footage sounds quite time consuming, but sounds like a cool idea! As a side note, ""slow"" content seems like a good fit for a stream (or maybe a vod-style video?) and same with the one-off videos 'cause then it's more about the connection than the content."
0,Have you ever built a redstone contraption and then realized at the end you made it way too complicated and the real solution was much simpler?
0,"How do I say this nicely?  Vechs has become a significantly more controversial figure in recent years, so, idk, do with that what you will.  That said, I'd love an edited CTM video!"
0,Just found out YouTube had muted my notifications for 4 years  I thought you'd left YouTube
0,Etho you might also be able to improve the ergonomics of your monitors by raising them up slightly so you don't have to slouch when looking at them. Luv u!
0,why is there not a dropper system to put the zombie flesh back into the nether ? you will only need 1 item ? a key
0,hey etho would you be able to use snow as a way to stop the baby piglins from going in? or powdered snow
0,"Really the desk photo explains the mouse and keyboard thing so well..make sure you share that with the gang, idk why they were so confused by it!"
0,I would love a super hostile playthrough thats edited for better pacing (Legendary would be huuuuuuge) !!
1,"Etho, amazing video!!! The way you paced the creation of the potion machine and the level of explanation was perfect this episode. Walking us through the new and interesting part, while skipping through the autobrewer construction was great. I have been appreciating the big project episodes but this and the last episode was a nice change of pace. I watched this when it first came out but I am revisiting it now :D"
0,"Etho, does the Looting effect work with the sword in the offhand?
Also, old series that are Golden: Captive Minecraft. Crash Landing, Project Ozone"
0,"36:57 Etho with that bye-bye, you need to steal Joel Haver's outro in one video"
1,"Man this episode was so awesome. And we could really hear how much of a good mood you were in while filming this one. One of my favorite parts of your base in the Nether was this section today so it was great to be seeing it get some love.

Also watching you mess around with potions reminded me of the old Mindcrack days around Season #5 when you built that Automatic poison potion farm in your base on top of the dark oak forest."
0,Oh man I would love it if you revisited Legendary or did any SH style maps. I think it would be awesome to see nowadays. Please!
1,"Will you ever make another TerraFirmaCraft series? The modern remake for 1.20.1 is REALLY good and constantly blows me away with how much they have improved upon the OG version of TFC that you played back in the day, especially with assets and world gen. The biomes are so much more lifelike now with the temperature and humidity system, new animals and flora, and there are even fun new features like glass blowing. Honestly would love to see you play through this new version of TFC. Thanks again!"

0,"Hi ! For the superhostile series, I'm sure that you'll get a decent number of views, especially if it's ""a novelty"" for a big part of your audience. Treat it like as a Third Life series, enjoy your play and just cut out the long sections, or pick someone to do it for ya.
Edit : and don't forget, as someone said, that we enjoy your content because it's slowpaced as contrary to the other content creators"
1,Is that a guitar amp by your desk?! Do you play?
1,From what I've heard by other Minecraft-Creators the one off videos tend to do really well in comparison to series. So I would love to see how it goes and also will be enjoying the videos!
0,"Super Hostile and other maps work if they're well edited. If there's a lot of action, and it's not repetitive, you don't need to edit as much."
0,@EthosLab I think you can hold your sword in your off-hand and still get the looting effect
0,Mumboing around.... Legit.
0,"This might have been asked before but what do you do with every ""comment of the day"" after you read them? Do you have a special storage area for them or do you just chuck them in lava?"

1,"tbh the perfect format for those super hostile maps is streaming. i know you dont really stream at all, but thats the answer"
0,fast paced edited down CTM is a fantastic idea. Would watch.
0,Terraferma season 3?
2,"Hey Etho, great video (as always)! I especially enjoyed this one because you went step by step through all the technical details. I know that you feel pressure to create faster paced videos, but I have to say, I really enjoy the ones that focus more on taking us all along through almost every step (even the little ones) of the building processes, redstone, etc., being less like a ‚Äúshow and tell‚Äù video. This way the video feels personal, as if we are in the game right beside you. I know that this is not the popular format nowadays, but I would guess I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way. You explained in the video that if you do this too much, the episodes tend to feel ‚Äúempty,‚Äù however, I think you could go around this simply by posting longer videos. Again, I know this doesn‚Äôt align with the meta of YouTube, but I just thought I‚Äôd mention it. Anyways, I love your videos, and I will continue to watch them, regardless of the format or the game you are playing. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre amazing!"
0,"6:09 In my case, I gave up searching for the perfect comfortable chair and started doing one-hour sessions of Pilates or yoga before bed. It‚Äôs been two months now, and my back has improved amazingly!"
0,"instead of putting the Looting sword in the off-hand, Etho throws the healing potion and quick swaps like a pro."
0,AN ACTUAL IRL PHOTO FROM ETHO!!!
0,etho you could upload a 4 hour video of watching paint dry and i'd still watch it
0,"Hello Etho ,what is your new monitor ?"
0,"If you really want to min max content, do both by uploading the one video, and one raw recording of the playthrough.. even if it dosen't have the best dialogue a lot of people would put it on and enjoy it a lot."
0,"i found your channel through the ooge collab so i would love to see you do another super hostile map for old times sake. 

for the editing style you could make a few longer episodes. if we take legendary for example, it could be an entire intersection per video which would allow for more action while not packing so much content into a video that it becomes disorienting. i might be speaking for myself only but i know i wouldnt mind some longer episodes when it comes to a super hostile map just like how you released massive episodes for the decked out runs."
0,"Question out of ignorance: Why is Etho using this system for potion dispensing, and not just a dispenser? Is this just Etho wanting to do things different because it‚Äôs fun? Or is there a technical reason? To Etho, I love the videos, I am a long time fan! Just missed the explanation on this. Have a great day!"
0,"The 'supercut' or 'sleeptube' format for somewhat intense playthroughs works well. It also generates a good amount views and good retention if watched by the right viewers. It may also push your channel up in the algorithm. The key part about that format is either cutting in allot of details about whats happening, where your at, and what your doing, and/or adding a layer of commentary over it in select segments. Also keeping the viewers in a rollercoaster-esc state of suspension/action. It could be a cool project BUT it involves a TON of editing. I used to watch this guy 'forgelabs' on yt when he was making halo reach custom map content but now he only makes said minecraft 'supercut' videos. His channel has blown up ever since then. Anywho, it might be fun experimenting with if you would like to play through those maps and show them on yt. I think  thespiffingbrit may have some more information about how to achieve better numbers for longer form content like that."
1,is your skin kakashi
0,"Hi Etho,

At 30:00 aren't you comparing one brewing stand to four? If you had four non-chained stands, I don't see how potions/minute would be different to four chained ones.

Thanks,

0,"If the pigmen are down to half a heart or low health in general, why do the potions need to be level 2, wouldn't level 1 do the job?"

0,"It's worth nothing, but I agree I'd gladly watch longer, less edited content. The issue is that there are 1.5k comments at the time I'm writing this, and 240k views, and even if we assume 100% of the commenters want super hostile, that's 0.6% of viewers."
0,mad bomber challenge was awesome!
0,"Hey Etho, I'm not sure if you are in 1.21.5 yet, but there are some changes to powdered snow that might mess things up. It wrecked my farm. Have a good day."

it is there"
0,@EthosLab you recently said you mainly play Indie games... have you played Core Keeper? I'd love to watch your let's play on that.
0,"I want more slow form etho content with less editing... would you consider a second channel with lower effort posts that aren't as edited and maybe a super hostile etc that could be summarized on the main channel? 

I understand you want the channel to grow and stay interesting but I'm here for you not the minecraft at this point, ive been watching for over a decade and I haven't even really played minecraft anymore for 3/4 of that time"
0,id happily pay $50 a month just to have etho have a 2nd channel for games like ark and modded terraria

0,What was the biggest building mistake or red stone mistake where it made you almost quit or actually made you quit
0,"For the record, I enjoy watching/rewatching old playlists from OOGE and Team Canada more than the ""modern"" content on youtube. Too dense/packed for my taste. But I'm just one."

0,When moded ?
0,"etho! do you think you‚Äôll ever do anymore ctm maps with team canada? still so fun to go back and watch em, would love to see you play minecraft in a more adventure-oriented way‚Ä¶ modded series‚Äô and team canada really seem to hit the spot for my brain in that way. love to see whatever you do, and thanks for sticking with it all for so long. <3"
0,I would 100% watch you play a superhostile map !!!
0,"Love the idea of more one off videos! I was a massive fan of your super hostile playthroughs, so I would watch a full run though for sure, but I can totally understand it wouldn't perform well on the channel."

1,6:02 woooah
0,"Etho! Been forever since I seen you brother, it's good to hear that voice ü§ô"
0,"I remember the videos of one-off days fondly. I loved OOGE when I first started watching you and Project Ozone 2 became one of my favorite series later on. I understand your concerns about creating one-off videos in today's environment, but I think that many of your older viewers would love to see you explore other video types"
0,Do you play guitar? I noticed the amp in the tissue box picture
0,"For editing the video about the superhostile map why not play through it and then whenever you make a cut in the editing process, note the location of where you cut and then splice in you in spectator mode that you record after the fact that just zooms to the next clip if you skip alot of distance in the cut"
0,Hey Etho love all your videos. Been watching since your first world. I was wondering if you‚Äôd ever get into pixelmon again. I really enjoyed that series since I‚Äôm a Pok√©mon fan. Guess it  might be tough since you would need a server with other people again. But let me know your thoughts. Thank you !
0,"Etho! Now that summer is almost here, is there anything you like to do outside? Are there any games that annoy you so much that you decide to take a break and go outside at all? Thanks, you‚Äôre the best!"
89,DavyBhoyProductions here Etho. Cool to see you still using the channel icon I made 10+ years later haha hope you‚Äôre well.
0,"I understand caring about video performance because then it shows what your subscribers actually want to watch, but then again I wish you wouldn‚Äôt care so much about it because then you would just be posting what you want to post and have fun with it.

I like the long drawn out boring ones. I don‚Äôt like the really fast jumpy clipping ones all in one video. I always had a hard time watching Captain sparkles even though I really liked him, because of all of the jumping around."
0,"I watch minecraft for Etho, a slow series like super hostile is ideal. He could record in bulk then release gradually to fill the gaps between this and hermitcraft."
0,For the slower paced videos you could just livestream somewhere? Even on a different channel if you're worried about the viewership impacting your main channel? I would certainly watch that.
0,Crazy how once a few years ago you took 5-6 episodes to do something now it‚Äôs a 15 minute segment in the 30 minute episode
0,"I've been thinking about the mad bomber challenge for the last month! Funny you mention it now. I'd love to see more one-offs. I know you're not into the idea, but I bet they would perform well as shorts, and shorts main purpose is to pull in a new audience. I think the old heads will appreciate seeing the full videos and the shorts would be a a good intro to your humor and creativity for newbies."
0,"I still go back and rewatch the OOGE series at least once every two years or so. I remember being cooped up during Covid watching you, Bdubs and Guude starving to death in Starlight Caverns."
0,Day 1 of telling Etho that we have a ETHOS.lab fancy Microwave digestion system in our real life Lab at University and every time I walk past it I have to think about Etho...
0,"@35:50 Either way you want to do it, Etho, we'll enjoy it so long as you do! Part of the reason those old series were so great was because there was genuine fun and excitement. Just a thought!"
0,"Do they need to be instant health 2, wouldn‚Äôt instant health 1 suffice as they are 1 hp?"
0,Maps are far more niche than survival so it makes sense that super hostile performs worse
0,"The OOGE series is actually one of my best Youtube memories ever!! I watched the entire series 2 times(spellbound caves). An I would love to see a whole, unedited playthrough of Vechs old maps(or similar)!"
0,"Personally, I enjoy your long form content more than short form content. Generally, all long form content is better than short form. YouTube shorts suck."

0,"I'm totally up for more one-offs! And I personally do really enjoy the slower pace, basically unedited footage from playing the map, but I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much if you edit it down <3"
0,"Another one of your somehow-standard longggg-time viewers here (with a wife who doesn‚Äôt get why I haven‚Äôt played Minecraft in a decade but still watch every one of your videos). Do the one-offs! Those old maps will be so nostalgic to your fan base. Sad to think they didn‚Äôt get enough views to be worthwhile, but I‚Äôd say then just do shorter maps with less effort on your part‚ÄîI think all I really need to watch one of your videos is to hear you talk about stuff you enjoy and I‚Äôm in, so no need for you to spend way too much time and effort on something. I think the longer a one-off series goes the more viewership drops off (though please NEVER use that as a reason to stop the LP, that is just a different story). Thanks, man."
0,I finally caught up with the series! Took a whole month but it's definitely worth it.
0,I'd love to see the one off videos that don't have to be tied to a series!
0,For anyone who hasn't seen the old OOGE and Team Canada CTM series do yourself a favor and go watch them rn!

0,Bro start it from the oldest versionüíÄ
0,"Is the glowstone dust necessary?
Healing I feels like it should be enough to kill 1 hit pigmen, no? 2heart healing
Could save 25% of brewing time if I'm correct. You might've double checked and I might be in the wrong here. Also I know it's easy to make the potions better out of habit."
0,"It's only the second episode I've seen of your series and already you got a new computer. Ratings really do cash in, huh?
I usually watch people going into what they do. Not much for 'He said she said this is on brand'. I'm enjoying this vibe. Very chill <3"
0,"In regard to the consistency of your splash potions, would it be because the piglins are hopping up and down, so sometimes they hit one that‚Äôs jumping right in the trajectory of the potion?"
0,The first thing I noticed in the picture was the blanket on the office chair. I have been running that tech for a few years now but no one seems to get it
0,"I would definitely enjoy a second Etho channel where Etho just plays random games (e.g. streams with other Hermits, Super Hostile maps, SOTS-The Pit (loved this series!) and many more.)"

0,Omg Etho you're a guitarist???!!!
0,I was unironically invested in whether or not the box would stay as lart of the set up
0,"Now that you upgraded your pc, you could try uploading a higher resolution video. 
You could still record at whatever resolution you play at (assuming that's 1080p) but then, with the performance of your new PC export it as 4K and upload that to youtube.
It would get a higher bitrate so more detail would be kept. 
You export time would probably go back up after it just went down on the new PC and your internet connection would matter more but you could test it.

Just an idea, no pressure. 
Loving the video's for more that 10 years now"
0,"Don't ever get rid of the tissue box stand, we need to make sure it get's to a museum :) !"
0,THE PAST IS NOW
0,"honestly, I think a large part of your audience would watch almost any content you put out‚Äîwhether it's longer videos or any kind of new series, e.g. with OOGE or Team Canada or something completely new. So, taking into account how financially dependent on the youtube income you are, just post whatever you have fun playing and recording.
also, whenever you're building a new redstone machine like the brewer and don't want to put it into a video on the main channel, consider doing a ""b-sides"" channel. lots of people, me included, would love to watch you through the process"
0,"I think superhostile maps would work similar to the Decked out runs at holding attention, i think they'd do better than you think"
0,"Oh that idea for maps sounds amazing, it's a lot of work I think, but I'd love to see the end result. I think one-off vidoes are quite good too because you can just get into them and won't have to think about all the setup and other stuff that a series video requires, a change of pace is always good for the old noggin."
0,Would making the overworld portal a 2-block make the potions enter more centered? (between 2 blocks -> center of the 3 block)
0,"Hearing that the potion brewer in the man cave is like 10 years or so old makes me feel so old. I remember watching that video of you making it, along with that whole area down there. I really have been watching your videos for the better half of my life. thank you for always being there etho"

0,"The windows 11 layout is probably okay, but what scares me is how little trust Microsoft has earned when it comes to privacy. With all that stuff with Recall, idt I wanna touch Windows ever again."
0,"Etho I have a question!

Redstone has changed a ton since you first became invested in it; how approachable/easily accessible is modern Redstone in your opinion? I would think that because you got into it as early as you did it‚Äôs easy to adapt to updates, but for others who are either new to the game or are just getting interested in the technical aspect of Minecraft (like me) it gets all confusing and overwhelming. Like I said it may just be a me thing but I would love to know your opinion on the scope of Redstone these days :)

Also yaaaay new setup pic! Glad to see the tissue box survived the overhaul!"
0,"Ah its a good day, when there is a new Etho Lets play! Thanks!"
0,ha i have the same chair as etho lol
0,"Hey Ladders!
In reverse timestamp order: 

     Please do more fun one off videos. Your challenges, speedruns, and silly videos are all wonderful examples of great non-series videos! 

     Please try to not be afraid of slower videos. We crave dopamine from you, not just quick hits of dopamine from anyone. 
     If you want to try carefully editing down a day or 2 of playing Legendary to show highlights we'll happily watch it, but we'll adore watching slower and longer super hostile episodes. 

     I'm personally praying for an Etho teaches basic redstone mechanisms like monostable circuit with an example use 


     Ergo that computer is so pretty!!!!! Thank you for the picture!"

0,"i've never been so hyped to continue watching a MC let's play video. 
Amazing content Etho!"
0,"Slower and more longform content I want to keep so badly. Personally I feel a disconnect between content creator and viewer gets formed when the uploads are just highlight reels of a session. We know these videos take countless hours of passion and effort and we want to feel like we're a part of as much as we can be. Shoot if I had everything my way you'd have a second channel where your predominantly unedited footage gets uploaded! Sortof like a behind the scenes thought process journey. I know it sounds massively tiresome to have your content creation brain ""turned on"" for extended time but trust me we dont need attention grabbing lines constantly - we just want a peek in on the process. Continue to be our longform hero Etho as you have been for well over a decade, I know you disapprove of the pressures the ""attention span defecit"" has created."
0,I appreciate you knowing we‚Äôre invested in your ergonomics
0,Dang hes gotten a 1460
0,I know you have to still watch your stats but I would watch it either way. 30 minute episodes or one 2 hour video. Always appreciate a new Etho video

0,"Instead of a slab, could you use snow layers? Can you even put snow layers in the nether?"
1,"Hey Etho! In regards to CTM maps, I do prefer slower paced videos. It‚Äôs fun to see the build-up and I don‚Äôt think it would feel as rewarding if you finished the map in a single episode. I also think that trying to edit an entire map down into a single episode would make it hard to balance action and downtime. In your older CTM videos I always liked when you would take a break from exploring new areas and just plant trees or build a farm; the contrast between that and the action makes it interesting in my opinion.

That said, the YouTube algorithm is, as you‚Äôve said, not really favouring that type of content‚Ä¶ maybe a balance would be good, where instead of a single episode you finish a map in 3 or 5. You could also always create a second channel for that type of content, so it doesn‚Äôt harm the performance of your other videos (though I also understand why you might not want to)

Either way though, I would love to see you play more maps!"

0,"Hey Etho, why is it that the healing potions don't despawn in the overworld if it is being chunk loaded from the nether the whole time?"
0,"You were doing so well, you made the potion launcher mostly on camera and the fiddly calibration part was edited out, I think. But then you fell back onto old habits and made the potion _crafter_ off camera again, :D

I love all your series, but I do admit to nostalgia on the challenge maps or the subscriber specials. You introduced me to Matt McFarland's music with those, they still have a special place in my heart. I didn't really have much in the way of music variety back in those days, but even now I enjoy the tracks. My only concern is that there are almost too many maps and map videos now, I'm not quite sure what one would be interesting to see. I've played a lot of the modded ones and they all feel similar now - there are a lot of cool mechanics, but everyone uses the same ones.

I'm a little worried that your 14-series Intel might be at risk of the premature failures that year has become known for, but it otherwise sounds like a good machine. Still, I'm personally looking toward AMD for my next one because of that issue.

Rare pic of Etho's desk in this one. It looks haphazard, but you KNOW seeing that that it belongs to someone who knows exactly what they like and has spent a long time fine-tuning it. Even if that does result in a speaker in a very precarious corner..."
0,"0:30 -- 1460 NVIDIA -> I think he meant 4060 card
Awesome build man!"
0,"Yo Etho! There were a couple of moments in this video that made me want to leave this comment. You talking about making the video high-content and the comment of the day. I'd watch your videos even if you weren't making huge progress each time. I just enjoy watching someone play Minecraft that I've been watching since chocolate island (I'm mid 30s now!). I know it's important to make sure you're getting decent views on YT for the algo, but try not to worry too much about it or compare yourself to the more recent youtubers. Your content is great no matter what you're doing and the community rallies around it. If you're worried about the algo, consider making an ‚Äúextras‚Äù channel for some more old school experimental videos. Love you work. Thanks for all the content, keep it up :)"

0,"20:10 I doubt your harddrive will care since this should be in the operating system cache at the very least.
Well, at least if your aren't RAM starved or the people who implemented this from Microsoft weren't complete idiots (and while Windows may not be the best when it comes to such things, it's very much not *that* bad)."
0,You need to turn up the ram amount that your world can use. It will help performance a ton!
0,Thank you for another great video! I for one loved the superhostile map series! I think it would lose a lot of it was just a highlight reel.
0,This blew my mind‚Ä¶
7,6:00 Etho do you play the guitar? I noticed the peavey amp
0,"if u want to do those maps and make content with it you will pretty much have to hire a zoomer editor and play with friends otherwise most people wont watch,  they say they will in comments but they wont"
0,"i actually rewatched those old OOGE super hostile maps while waiting for hermitcraft season 10. it was jarring at first to see the differences in minecraft, but the gameplay and silly conversations (and bdubs singing constantly?) hold up so well. i would love to see  that sort of stuff again, however its edited down"
0,I realize the youtube algorithm is a thing and you need to be picky on what you air. So why not start a second channel just to live stream the non Minecraft game you play with no worries of editing or affecting the main channel. As I would love to watch your perspective when playing among us 3D or R.E.P.O.  And no need to have a live chat as I am sure us Fan boys would just be happy to watch you play with no interactions just the joy of watching you play from your respective.
1,"I would also like to see another super hostile, they are missed. I went through a phase of watching all of them years ago and they were so good and chill. It's a shame youtube is about chasing views and the 'top of the bell curve/median' these days rather than just having fun and uploading stuff regardless. There's lots of things that were great about Minecraft but are now lost to time. UHC being another I used to enjoy but for whatever reason never happens no more. Give me that over the life series' any day.

I feel like editing a map into one video would also remove a lot of the charm and i'd personally prefer the full thing. But regardless I'd still watch it; Etho can upload anything and I'll give it a view."
0,"Hey Etho, is it possible that Terraria will ever make a return? I really enjoyed watching those series back in the day. Not sure what Zisteau is up to now, but it would be cool to see you guys play the 1.4 update."
0,So no capture the monument with team Canada :( the good old days
0,I would love for you to make a second channel that you wouldn't have to worry about how videos perform and just upload everything. I would love to see your among us perspective for example.
0,"i'd love to see you play ctm maps again . I love the slow progression they provide and in my opinion it's some of the best content you have ever put out, despite the veiws you got on it ."
0,"I think the one off videos would work great. If you have a fun idea, you'll likely enjoy making the video, and I think it would perform pretty well. A win win scenario."
0,"Etho, have you ever used Linux? If so, what did you think? Would you ever consider running it instead of Windows?"
0,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôd watch Etho play Minecraft and recite the dictionary. He uploads it, I‚Äôll watch it and be happy"
0,"Man hearing someone else reminisce about the old videos made me think of the terraria videos with Zisteau ‚Äúterraria is EZ‚Äù Great times, really enjoyed those videos ;). And still making amazing content to this day, love it man. Thanks as always :)"
0,Don‚Äôt get me wrong I absolutely love watching you play Minecraft and I hope you don‚Äôt stop but have you ever thought of branching off and making videos for other games as well.  Obviously the game would be your choice but I‚Äôd love to see you make a runescape account!
0,"Hey Etho, I was curious‚Ä¶ since you‚Äôre really the only Minecraft YouTuber I watch, is there a ‚Äúmeta‚Äù farm that almost all Minecrafters use? Or has redstone become so multidimensional that everyone makes their own version of farms to fit their needs?"
0,"Sir, with all due respect, who cares how a video performs? Do what you feel like doing. Have fun and the audience for that thing will find you and thank you!"
0,Congrats on the new computer Etho üéâ
0,"Would be interesting for you to do a ""statpoker"" ish game on this world and showcase ur statistics from all these years of playing"
0,"I recently hopped into Spellbound Caves the other day, and the mob light limit changes have really altered how the map plays. Still very cool, but nowhere near as hard."
0,why not lingering potions?
0,I would think the main improvement comes from the much larger L1i and L1d cache sizes on the dye
0,"I'd love to see another legendary play through, but as unedited as possible!! (Unless its going to be an edit into a full 12 hour long video)"
0,"I remember watching Etho when I was 12, now 11 years later and I still enjoy watching this awesome person and the nostalgia of time with each lets play episode is heartwarming as well, the memories just flow"
0,"About the adventure maps, you could even do a mini-series if the episode was stretching too long or if there was a good spot for ending an episode"
1,"At 5:59, that‚Äôs a guitar amp? Etho, do you play guitar?"
0,Did I see a guitar amp in that setup shot? Do you play guitar or other instruments Etho?
0,"I think a lot of the more slow form content, like the super hostile playthroughs and things like that have moved to streaming and VODs on a second channel of some kind

I‚Äôve seen sparkles doing a lot of that stuff on streams and then just uploading the stream to YouTube on a second channel"
0,"I think your idea is pretty good for recording the maps, I would definitely give it a go and watch it üëç"
0,"Hi Etho! In the picture you showed of your desk, I spotted a Peavy amp under your PC tower! Do you play any instruments? What kind of music do you listen to?"
3,ETHO don't think I wouldn't notice you have TWO identical mice! Tell me you don't with both! 6:05
0,Nice amp
0,"OMG!!! Yes to this comment of the day! I am convalescing from a surgery and I am planning on watching them AGAIN! My favourite part is seeing the whole process failing, trying and figuring it all. Whenever I feel meh, those series are my go to.

Also, glad the Keenex box survived!"
0,I'm all for the slow paced videos. I'd happy sit through an entire playthrough of a super hostile map with no edits!
0,"Please do a super hostile type super edit!! You say Minecraft videos are about showing creativity, you could walk us thru creative problem solving on how you get thru maps!"
0,Would love to see an old style series of Legendary or any other maps from the old days. One off videos also sounds like a lot of fun!
1,"I'm working on a adventure world map, it has started to become its own game in the game you could say ^^"
1,"The effort and quality in Etho videos is amazing. As plenty of comments say, we'd genuinely enjoy any level of video, but the craftsmanship in most Etho videos is something else and doesn't go unappreciated!"
0,Are you ever going to do more modded minecraft of any kind? It's been like 2 years since your last one and I miss them
1,"Etho could upload 20, 40-minute Superhostile episodes, and we would watch every second of them!"
0,"Etho, in light of some content not performing well, would you consider making a second channel? I think that would balance out your need to keep this channel on top of the algorithm with the ability to occasionally post lower-effort long-form gameplay elsewhere. I would love to see your footage from REPO or Among Us 3D or a superhostile map, but you've talked about how tough it is for you to post anything other than MC on this channel. I think it would be fine to cobble that together with minimal editing and throw it up on a second channel for whatever adsense revenue it might collect and that wouldn't hurt your main channel. Like how the hermits use their second channels."
0,S7 was 5 yrs ago nowü§Ø
0,"Canopy carnage was one of the first videos I seen. I loved it a lot. Today's Etho would not be able to recreate the same survival and exploration feeling, being to experienced now. Unless he learns to roleplay."
0,‚ÄúNow imagine I‚Äôm a potion‚Äù love you Etho
0,"Man It‚Äôs been a minute since I rewatched legendary
Guess it‚Äôs time to revisit that again"
1,"Hey etho, if the zombie pigmen are at 1 hit, why did you brew them as instant health 2?"
0,"Might be a dumb question, but why not a lingering potion?"
0,"Doc used an item separator in his teleport stations, but didn't really explain how it works. Your explanation was great. I understand the system a lot more."
0,The tissue box is an integral part to this channel's success! Of course it's still there :D
0,"I think this is my favorite redstone episode you've done, Etho. You did a great job of explaining the concepts/ systems at play, and you combined concepts in ways that made for really amazing outcomes. Really awesome job! :)"
0,The Fact that the Peavy 1x8 fits Perfectly in the little cubby whole is great!
0,That‚Äôs no blanket! That‚Äôs a quilt!
0,"Re: the enderman farm, isn't the rocket sound the same as the throw potion sound (as heard by sculk)?"
1,"One-off goofy videos again would be absolutely wonderful etho and mixes it up for you too. Also I would absolutely watch the HECK out of an episode-by-episode play through of Legendary, holy moly that would be amazing. I still go back and rewatch OOGE regularly lol i've watched all of it like 10 times"
0,"Is it possible to reuse the mechanic that keeps bottles at a better resting position in the water column before being sent by slime block launcher? (water flowing downwards, while in a bubble column?)"
0,If you hold a looting 3 sword in your off hand will it still affect the zombie pigmen? If you were building and were switching between all a lot of blocks it might be handy.
0,etho's super old intro is so charming
0,"Hey Etho, I noticed the amp in the picture you shared of your new PC setup. (Congrats btw!) Do you play guitar or bass? If so, what kind of music do you like to play? 

I‚Äôve owned an acoustic guitar since I was a kid, but I didn‚Äôt have the patience to commit to learning how to play it until very recently, as an adult. I feel very strongly that it‚Äôs never too late to learn new things, which is probably something that a lot of your viewers have in common.

All the best! <3"
0,my man got a new computer and a monitor but still plays at 60 fps...
0,Etho I see that peavy what are you jamming out on after recording ?!
0,Hey Ergo‚Ä¶ you should fill in your dirt‚Ä¶
0,Perhaps try changing the glass block that gets hit by the splash potion with a slightly smaller block like a fence post or a chest to get it closer to the center. Could help with consistency as long as items dont get stuck on it.
0,NEW COMPUTER? LETS GO!
0,The gold and XP flying back through the portal on the first test was hilarious
0,This new computer sounds like you bought it 10 years ago. I figured you'd have a beast of a machine.
1,your video thumbnails are sooooo unique that i got happy while scrolling through my recommended because my subconcious was able to tell that was an etho thumbnail before i took a proper look
0,"Thanks for the video Etho! I agree with other commenters that I come to see what YOU are up to, not for crazy action. 

Your creativity, laid back tone, cheerful attitude, and clean content are what keep me coming back again and again.

I really ejoyed your Projet Ozone 2 content, dispite only finding the channel during Secret Life and never knowing about PO2 before that. So I can attest that some of your newer subscribers do enjoy the slower, spin-off content.

I was watching Scar's stream the other day (I see Etho I click and Scar knows it!) He was lamenting the fact that you can't hang out in real life. Do you think you would ever risk meeting the other Hermits in person?"
0,"Hey Etho! Hate to be the bearer of unfinished projects, but I'm curious if anything came out of your Wacky Pixel Display idea. I thought it was a really cool concept but I get that sometimes not all of our Minecraft ambitions comes to fruition. Would love to see it featured in something, even if it's just a display for a minigame or some storage system indicator. Thanks for keeping us entertained for so many years!"
0,"I would love a classic episodic map playthrough series, but if you want to experiment with the format i would be on board. More one offs would be cool too."
0,"Hey Etho, Your processor the intel 14700 was subject to a potentially destructive bug, that could lead to instability or permanent cpu damage/performance degradation.  Intel released a bios update september of 2024 that fixed the issue, and extended the warrenty for anyone with an affected sku.  Please make sure your bios is up to date so that you dont run into issues.  The bug affects most intel 13th and 14th desktop cpus, and your model is one of them."
0,Man i haven‚Äôt played or followed Minecraft in years but used to religiously watch Etho. Watching now is wild. I have no idea what most of this is
0,can etho still hold the looting sword in his offhand and get the effect from the potion kills?
0,I think another long form skyblock would be great. *cough* star technology *cough*
2,"Nooooo I don‚Äôt want a heavily edited cut up version of map playthroughs, please don‚Äôt. üò≠ you‚Äôre one of the people whose long-form let‚Äôs plays I enjoy so much that I don‚Äôt wanna miss a second of the gameplay and commentary"
0,"I really like the idea of the long form videos if you decide to play/post map playthroughs again, especially if that reduces the effort required for editing and uploading. But if that requires more careful editing I wouldn‚Äôt want it to end up being just as laborious as breaking it up into multiple episodes and then deter you from posting at all. I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind a minimally cut long format video that maintains the narrative and cohesion that your old map series had. Also, I don‚Äôt know about logistics with collaborating with other minecrafters but some of my all time favourite videos of yours are when you played with friends. The appeal for me was really the fun you all had working through challenges but bantering and having fun while you were doing it. I also know that your videos where you played non-Minecraft games didn‚Äôt get as many views either but I really loved watching you play other games and seeing your different methods to approaching the various goals and challenges for non-Minecraft games. I still frequently watch Don‚Äôt‚Äô Trace, Terraria, Cube World, Stardew Valley, etc. I‚Äôve come to appreciate them more the longer I‚Äôve been engaging with your work!"
0,"Speaking of more older Etho content, I remember really enjoying your playthroughs of some point and click adventure games on here. Crazy how the playthrough of Sam and Max is 11 years ago."
0,What about using a fence or a wall on the block under the slab instead of a slab? Would it make a difference?
0,"I wonder if the potions would fly more consistently if you used the same flowing water trick used in the separator but to prevent the final item from bobbing in the water. 
Might be easier said than done due to the slime block though."
0,"Have you tried the sequel to SOTS: The Pit? It doesn‚Äôt have the best reviews since they tried making it 3D, but I loved your original playthrough. I‚Äôd love to know if you still enjoy games like that."
0,nahh i was not expecting to lose etho to windows 11 today... Aware
0,Etho‚Ä¶ in the picture of your awesome mic set up. I noticed to be what i assume to be coffee. That being said I think we all would like to know something. It‚Äôs something so important and the world does depend on it and for science. How do you take your coffee? I like it black or with some milk but that‚Äôs me would about you? Also awesome videos keep it up üéâ
1,"""We have a huge stack of Zombie Flesh to shoot through the Portal"" - Just things you can say in Minecraft"
0,Etho you should really consider a better mouse. The ergonomics and reduced strain of clicking in a game like Minecraft is huge
0,hello ethoslab i am a big fan
0,Oh God that comment about the original autobrewer being TEN years ago hit me in the gut lol
0,"I wonder if the pigmen jumping up when the pistons fire is causing the potion to occasionally hit one of them which would explain why the potion only sometimes hits all of them. Regardless, what an amazing design!"
0,YES TO GOOFY VIDEOS
0,"ive been doing the blanket thing for years, i highly recomend, and if its cold you can wrap a blanket around you and wear it like a poncho"
0,I wish i can show etho my game setup of laying down with the screen somewhat over me
0,"I can‚Äôt believe this series is still going, that‚Äôs really cool and reassuring. I first found your channel in summer 2013 which is when I got into Minecraft for the first time. And I‚Äôm still impressed with all the builds you made."
0,Ooh I see a little practice amp! Is that for guitar or something else? Do you manage to fit in much playing?
0,"I'd bet a playing a superhostile would go over pretty well as a live stream... ya know, just saying..."
0,"Hey Etho, if you hadn‚Äôt been making YouTube videos on it all these years, do you think you would still be playing Minecraft, or would you have moved on?"
0,Would you consider doing an elbow reveal? its like a joke reveal for content creators who dont actually want to reveal anything. i just think it would be really funny lol
0,5:55 I think I would have such a physical reaction to seeing etho irl. I got a wave of chills just seeing his desk xD
0,"Building on your idea of doing a fun video every now and again, would you ever upload you playing other games just for fun but make the video unlisted so it doesn‚Äôt tank your YT recommendations and w/e but you actually get to play and share more games you love with the community"
0,i love how u surprise us with uploads etho
0,Team Canada could return!
0,"New map play throughs would be amazing!
It'd be wonderful to see more."
0,"just to throw an idea out there since the world tour would be kinda somewhat soon, would love to see some guest appearances"
0,Dose etho play guitar or base?
0,"You are the only channel i watch regularly , I don't even play Minecraft"
0,I will always respect Vechs for introducing me to Etho!
0,You could speed up the potion reloading by breaking a chest above your head and remapping right-click to a keyboard input
0,Maybe upload the unedited version on another channel or something. Stuff like the long Decked out Supercuts are amazing to watch.
0,"Would this system also work for a Creeper farm, but using a Potion of Harming combined with the fall damage the Creeper takes?"""
0,We got a new Etho lore before GTA 6
0,"that chain potion contraption looks so compact, thats awesome"
0,"Everytime that potion hits the piglins I do a little bit of ""woo!"" :D
This was a fun project to watch."
0,"Hey Etho, I noticed you have a Peavey guitar amp! How long have you been playing? What kind of genres do you usually like to play?"
1,Much faster than the combrewter!
0,"Hi Etho! Regarding super hostile and attention span - I think most of your audience (including myself) have been following for many years and would actually absolutely enjoy long and less action videos. It‚Äôs probably true that most of the landscape online shifted to these high energy, frequent cuts kind of content. But I think your audience is different, at least speaking for myself.
Regardless of how you choose to do it, I would love to see it!"
0,i hope you can stream now Etho. i think it will be fun like you can build or grind material and we just hangout while listen to your story. i feel like your story or overall life experience is so nice and relaxing to hear.
0,With all these new decorative blocks and variations... Would you ever re-detail the Man Cave?
0,"I like the slow and longer content (though I don‚Äôt always have time for it). Everything else on YouTube now is so fast paced and it gets super overwhelming to the point where I don‚Äôt have the energy to watch most videos on YouTube sometimes, and just watch ASMR or something chill. Definitely feels like you loose some of that genuine-ness as well."
0,"Sorta about the comment, I think it would be fun if you did some separate content with hermits like mini series, maybe like a small modpack. I always wanted an etho & bdubs series!"
0,"Ah yes, the tissue box, my favorite reoccurring character, so glad its still around lol
Also, I did notice some bitrate issues at various points during this video
Also also, the one off videos were really fun, and maybe if you do go through with the 1-video-map idea a map type transition/recap would work? Like ""I was there, now I am here"""
0,"Etho! really neat gold farm design, i love redstoney episodes, thank you for allways delivering great content!"
0,Glad the tissue box survived
0,"Etho, are you really using a guitar amp as a subwoofer? Thats absolutely gnarly"
0,"Perhaps instead of a long series, you could upload a mammoth video along with an edited one. The edited one can appeal to those that want a short and sweet experience, the longer video will appeal to those of us who wants to experience every single second of the shenanigans."
0,"Been having a horrible week, seemed like everything was going wrong this morning, but that bad luck streak is over because Etho has uploaded!"
0,Maybe you could stream the superhostile maps?
0,"i honestly reckon majority of minecraft watchers are there for the creators! tbh anything you would put out, i would definitely watch in a flash! even if it is one timer games or even like the 3D among us you played with the hermits recently! 
thanks for doing this tho, it brings me so much joy everytime theres a new video! tysm!"
0,what about arrow with healing effect
1,New etho lore unlocked: he plays guitar
0,"I'm pretty sure last time you got a new computer, you went to this exact end farm. Are you taking them with you for bubble baths? Are we going to see another end farm computer update in another 15 episodes?"
0,<3
0,"Etho splashed out for an upgrade, I hope you upgraded your tissue box mic holder - 3 ply sounds good :)"
0,"Hey Etho, I feel like the bitrate of this video has been lower than usual for you. Is this a YouTube issue or are your settings in OBS (?) maybe different? Just a heads up!"
0,"I understand we need to keep the content tuned to keep the audience engaged - but I wonder if Etho ever considered a ""secondary channel"" for tutorials or other longer-format videos?"
0,Looking forward to watching vids in 220fps from now on!
0,"what IF......you use instead, Lingering Potion?!"
0,YAYAYAYAYYAAYAYAYY

0,"Why do you buy an outdated budget pc? You have 2.6million subs lol
I watch you since over 10years treat yourself you deserve it."
0,"on super hostile, ive been watching other YouTubers play through old ctm maps and the like to honestly get away from the super fast paced content,, there's something so genuinely refreshing about super long form content, and its not like maps don't require some creativity o: in particular I've been watching a YouTuber named Neurotic Goose who just got done with a playthrough of an old Vechs map and his methods and problem solving skills set that playthrough apart from others,, I think map content from you would be fantastic honestly and how you would approach the map will make it super interesting o: you also were the one to get me into Minecraft maps, watching you play through Simulation Protocol all the way to Diversity 3 with team Canada, so I'm always up for that wave of nostalgia again!"
0,"I wouldn't have recommended the i7 14700K as their is a extremely high amount of cases where the 14700K causes a lot of crashes due to its high voltage burning itself apart, if you are going to keep that cpu, definitely under volting it otherwise in a year or 2 the CPU will be dead if not constant crashes on anything that requires a decent amount of CPU usage. I HIGHLY recommend changing the CPU to an AMD high end or at the very least go the Intel Ultra series CPU's.

Please please please change it etho!"
0,"Hey Etho! Long time viewer, i notice you have a small vintage peavey amp beside your desk. Do you play guitar? If so, could you tell us about your favourite music genre(s)?  Thank you for the hours and hours of inspiration and entertainment over the years =D"
1,"Hey etho,
I see you have a guitar amplifier. Do you play guitar?"
0,Love this episode
0,"Aha! A shorter episode, but well apreciated."
0,amazing video etho! the farm is seriously so cool
0,"I don't think you can actually move away and do stuff cause the mobs can only spawn so far away from you, and if you get out of the slabbed zone then they will spawn less and less in the designated zone and you would be wasting potions for nothing in return"
0,5:55 Etho. How did you get your two mice to move around your desk like that?
0,I miss team Canada videos
1,"idk if this makes sense to anyone else but the slower paced just walking around the base/world gives me vlog vibes and i think that‚Äôs why i‚Äôve enjoyed any etho video so much, specifically the etho plays series. just calm relaxing chatting and sometimes shenanigans"
0,"I am sorry.. Happy you got a new computer and all, but is youtube not paying that much? The specs are pretty bad to be honest, I would expect that when it's a business expense and you do it for a living you would have gotten something better"
0,"#39 on trending for gaming on 5/22/25, 15 hours after upload"

0,"Echoing what another commenter said, with the first trailer for Thaumcraft 7 dropping, I would LOOOOVE to see you do something with it when it comes out!

Long-time viewer, first time commenter - keep tinkering away in your blocky worlds :) Thanks for everything"
0,The mad bomber challenge was a great video
0,its wild to think ive been watching you for 10 or 11 years now
0,Basically SHC Movies from you sound really awesome.
0,All hail the costco tissue box!
0,"Loving the video Etho, that updated desk pic made me juuump! Honestly I know nothing about minecraft mechanics or redstone, but your content is so chill and fun that I would watch regardless of whether I understand it. So glad to see the tissue box remains üî•üî•"
0,"Hey Etho, with the 1 episode per super hostile map video format would you consider linking a unlisted video of long format for those of us that would watch that?"
0,"14:25 iirc Methodzz and Glotz are the first time I ever saw entity seperation, but knowing the tech community it was about just not public domain"
0,This was pure Etho‚Äôs Lab at its finest!!
1,"Hey Etho! Please make sure to update your BIOS immediately! Intel 13 and 14th gen have long term issues that will slowly kill them, even at stock speeds and voltages, you'll noticed blue screens become more frequent. There's another update coming soon which you'll also want to make sure to install which *should* fully fix the issue for new CPUs, but once damage is done it cannot be fixed, it's permanent."
0,1:40 ‚ÄúI probably don‚Äôt have to worry about performance in Minecraft ever again‚Äù. 26:10 ‚ÄúThat might be what‚Äôs causing the lag‚Äù
0,"Get a new desk, mount the monitors, reclining chair"
0,Over 10 years later and I still remembered my snacks
0,Did you build the pc yourself?
0,"did you see the outdoor boys retired, thoughts on him leaving due to the fame and attention on his family?"
0,The channel Neurotic Goose is running a Vechs map right now. His editing style seems to fit the faster pace of youtube without being distracting or confusing
0,Please do super hostile! Many of us still prefer the slower content. Doesn't need to be action packed in one episode from my perspective.
0,"The problem with doing the standalone video with a lot of editing is that it will take time and effort and it will substitute a video from your current series, which we currently don't have a good enough frequency on. I'd say for you to chill with the map, edit it to get it acceptable and release it as an extra. Bonus points if its multiplayer. When you finish the map/series of videos, release an edited version (that you can pay someone to do if you want, so the time impact will be even less). I watch edited versions of some series that you have made by fans and its awesome."
0,"Hey Mr. Etho, I'd like to know if you still play Hearthstone (or any other game) and if you would ever think about doing another video on it, I loved watching the Hearthstone videos you made a while back. Anyways, thank you for picking my comment, and thank you for bringing a smile on my face. :D"
0,Oh boy! I wonder if etho(ergo) will start a new project today!
0,Etho ive been wathcing u for 10 years ur the greatest
0,"We will always be there to watch whatever you put out, you have some of the most calming and wholesome and technical and inspiring Minecraft content out there.

Not sure you should replay Legendary though, getting back into whatever version of minecraft it was is gonna be a pain, and I'm not sure if Vechs ever ported the maps past the food and combat updates. And the next ones. And all those.

I'd love it if you played through Netherbound Caves though, I loved that map when I played it a few years back."
0,"A 14th gen intel chip? Well, expect to roll the odds on it starting to die from this moment on. Notoriously bad generation of CPUs, same with 13th gen."
0,Personally i think it would be great this format you talked about it
0,Super cool idea!
1,"Etho, I recently got my dad invested in Minecraft. He doesn't consume much out-of-game content (vids, wikis), because he loves to experiment, insisting I mustn't ""spoil"" how anything works. 
However, he gets stuck by redstone. He's frustrated that pistons get ""jammed"" in place randomly (quasi-connected without a block update). He doesn't get why hoppers stop working arbitrarily (they're locked, without visual cue). He can't figure out calibrated sculk sensors, or comparator strength. Do you think aspects of redstone that could be taught better, and how would you improve them?"
0,A new season of terraferma craft would be sweet
0,"Hi Etho, thanks for another great episode! You might have tested it before and I might have forgotten, but would it be worth smelting those golden swords?"
0,"if you do choose to do an edited down version of a superhostile map or such, please also upload a raw version unlisted, at the very least. I enjoy your vids"
0,"Amazing! New PC, New monitor, New etho pic and we kept the kleanex box! 

Etho I was wondering, in that picture I noticed the peavey amp in your desk. Do you play an instrument or is it for an audio setup? Im a music enjoyer myself so id love to know. Anyways thanks for the great videos!"
0,"I watched all the vids with you pause and beef on beefs channel.
Would definitely watch"
0,It would be awesome to bring race for the wool back!
0,"I honestly will watch hours of raw content, I don‚Äôt even need lots of talking!"
0,you should try to play adventure map Drehmal. I played a lot of adventure maps and Drehmal is really next level of quality and is simply amazing
2,15:40 Mumboing around??
0,"My brother and I grew up watching Etho, and we still sometimes text each other when you upload. You are a household name"
0,I also really missed the super hostile maps!ory of you figuring it out and conquering it was gold to me!
0,Jeez... Am I old? I remember last time you talked about your new computer... Which I suppose is your old one now....
0,"Man, I'd absolutely love it if you would pay a super hostile map again. But definitely in the slower playthrough format please!"
0,I go back and watch Canopy Carnage every couple years. I would love to see you replay it or similar again. Not sure I like the condensed into one or two episodes idea though.
0,"As far as CTM maps go, most of your viewers would prefer the long-form videos with minimal editing because of early 2010s nostalgia. The editing format in your Uncharted Territory videos should be the gold standard.

Some maps I recommend are Simulation Protocol III (1.12) and Ragecraft IV (1.20). These are both excellent maps that I thoroughly enjoyed playing through. Some older maps I also recommend are Titan's Revolt and Ragecraft III (both for 1.8.9)."
0,"Would love to see you play through an older super hostile map. I‚Äôve played through a few of them recently with some friends, and they are an absolute blast."
0,"I would be absolutely ecstatic to see more super-hostiles, but I don't think I like the sound of too much cut content. I quite enjoy your videos, and in my opinion, the more to watch, the better. I went back and watched the entirety of the latest Decked Out season a few months ago, and enjoyed every bit.
As for what to play, I know that Vechs released a Super Hostile modpack for his later maps, and I remember you once mentioning that you had an itch for modded minecraft that needs to be scratched on occasion. Would any of those interest you? Do you have any particular opinion on the modpack in question?"
0,"Etho's brewer design explanation @ 29:10 in essence is parallel ""computing"" instead of serial ""computing""."
0,"You have a peavey amplifier.
Tell me you play an instrument!"
0,"been watching you for over 10 years and i will say i love any kind of video you make! i really enjoy your newer videos with a lot of progress and content in them, but there is something really special about slower videos where you get taken along for the ride. one off episodes would be really cool to see from you, especially ones where you revisit old maps or challenges. my favorite video of all time is your ""escape the nether with pause and beef"" video and it would be awesome to see challenge videos with team canada. keep up the great work etho!"
0,"Wow I just watched all the episodes that note his tissue box mic stand (like the weird playstyles Hermitcraft episode by Grian, an animatic of that by StudioLepta, Etho's perspective, and a reddit post + threads talking about Etho's setup shown from the image during the clip from his perspective), so to see an immediate update on the tissue box is pretty awesome"
0,"begging for long form content, i would watch a fully play through of those old maps omg"
0,New Etho lore. Peavey amp in the corner for playing guitar.
0,I feel like the dud potion shots might be hitting the pigmen when theyre jumping. Maybe try making the floor honey so they cant jump. Just a guess.
0,Etho plays guitar confirmed!
0,had a terrible today but its all fine now cuz etho uploaded :D
0,wow etho is doing redstone from a separate dimension thats amazing
1,hey Etho I've been watching for a really long time. i remember years ago you played a game that was turn based and you fought random creatures in a Sci-Fi space kind of setting. would you ever play that game again?
0,"Hey Etho, what do you use that peavy amplifier for?"
0,Blanket over the chair is very cabincore! :)
0,Yes! Please do more Minecraft maps- maybe 1 intersection an episode could be a good pace?? I personally would love to watch it in the slower paced old school format for the nostalgia- but i hear you
0,Personally i watch your content for the slower pace and dont mind the old school stule with less editing but i get that thats not ehat most peoppe want
0,I'd watch one off edited down map videos. Ambiguous Amphibian does that and I think they're pretty good. Honestly if it was 10 episodes long and we knew it was gonna be 10 episodes it might be more easy to watch. I've started watching more series than I've finished and i think the clarity of knowing when it ends makes it more watchable.
0,"As so many others said about themselves, I grew up alongside you and this Let's Play. It's strange to think about, but he may well be one of the most stable voices in many lives out there, Huh? Thank you ETHO."
0,"i love the idea of you doing the maps again, i think the ""highlights"" concept is good, but (and maybe this is just me being a superfan of all the series you've made playing maps solo and coop since like 2014) i always have loved the space between ""moments"" of moving around the map and stuff, they worked as build-up so the big moments hit even harder: a trap going off, a death, a great joke, a memorable interaction, etc. 

i feel like having the faster paced style would shrink that build-up, but i also think it depends on your particular editing hand, i really enjoyed all your decked out runs and i loved your editing style in them, not cutting out too much but leaving out some bits some people might've lost attention at.

whatever you decide i feel will be the right decision! (also definitely do the one-off videos again!, really important part of the Ergo Channel Experience ‚Ñ¢)"
0,"Etho, could you have used lingering healing potions instead, or are they somewhat unfeasible to brew?"
0,Love your videos. Would love to see you do something like Skyfactory again. Thanks for everything you do!!
0,124 xp just casually
0,"I always love your vids and i never complained, but redstone on dirt... Love you Etho üòä"
0,YAYYYYYY
1,"Man, I started this series watching on a palm pilot in 1967 and here I am watching now. Etho didn‚Äôt even have a channel yet, I‚Äôd just sneak in and look over his shoulder. The internet wasn‚Äôt invented yet but just the two of us still had minecraft. I‚Äôm the equivalent of ‚Äòfirst‚Äô but with thinly veiled pretentiousness."
0,"Hey Etho, out of curiosity, what are some of your favorite other games? Also what are some of your favorite moments from those games? I know you tend to stick to minecraft for the channel, but you've played a few other things and have mentioned some other games, such as Terraria, Transformers: War for Cybertron, Pokemon/Pixelmon, and so on. I am just curious about what you enjoy, and things or moments that stuck out to you. Have a great day, and thanks for the video!

0,"Maps were fire, especially if u enjoy them."
4,"Sometimes I really feel like I need an Etho video. This was one of those days. the ""Hello Everybody this is Etho!"" never fails to cheer me up."
0,gotta remember Etho girls with watch anything you upload
198,"35:57 I loved the old superhostile / CTM videos. I really liked the raw, uncut long format of them, and kind of enjoyed when you‚Äôd be stuck at the same entrance to a room for the whole episode. The problem solving and shenanigans with Beef and Pause are something I miss in today‚Äôs YouTube meta. Maybe I‚Äôm just an old head, but I would love to see a revival of them, even if just on a second channel. 

I think you have a unique audience in the fact that many of your oldest fans are now grown up and don‚Äôt play the game anymore ‚Äî we just still come back every episode for the nostalgia. You‚Äôre like a ‚Äúcomfort youtuber‚Äù. Someone I can trust to always put out enjoyable content. A fan base like that doesn‚Äôt care if everything is part of the new short attention span generation that needs constant action. We watch your videos for you. A 30 part series with hour long episodes sounds phenomenal. Great way to unwind after a day at work"
0,"Yes yes yes to bringing back super hostile & one-off videos! Revisiting Legendary and possibly playing a new map would be great. It would even be nice to see short series/one-offs of other games you're into at the moment, like back when you did Sword of the Stars & Hearthstone. It might be nice to be able to put out some lower-effort/less edited content to fill gaps between 'main' uploads!"
0,"love the idea of more one-off videos. ive been watching cscoop and friends play the old maps. and while we're a bunch of silly stoners, it's still very well edited and worth checking out for inspo!"
0,I would love to see spaz again just for a one-off episode like you used to in your LP's üòä
0,Whats the Peavey for? Etho a secret guitar player???
0,"That Peavey amplifier is amazing, with that desk and those speakers I'm almost transported back in time üòÖ"
0,You didn‚Äôt get an SSD??!?!?!
23,"It makes me really happy to see the 'Etho's lab' potion setup still working well a decade later. It doesn't seem to me that the redstone is that much different, just more compact with observer clocks and some added features. The 'auto-clicker' concept and execution was quite fun to experience as well!

Speaking of old concepts, back in the day you would often confess your love for sandstone. A lot of the older builds in your world are still full of sandstone, such as the original Tree Farm. Has that love faded throughout the years or does sandstone still hold a special place in your heart?"
0,"Makes me nervous when you are walking on orange glass on top of lava lake üòÇ

Why not also smelt the gold swords to gold nuggets üòä

I wonder if the ""complete the monument"" map is finally finished you played with Beef and Pause, it had nine wools ready at the time you played it."
0,"Etho when you bought your new computer, why did you pick the best specs from like five years ago? Not flaming I'm genuinely curious, I don't imagine you're strapped for cash?"
0,"Man remembering the super hostile maps was crazy! Thats how I ended up finding you back in the day etho. Do you remember the spawner ""eruption"" trap? What if you did a bit of a combined making a super hostile map/ playing through... though then maybe it will just be like another series that has yet to see its end..."
0,"Does off hand sword still do looting? That was an easy way to do it, if I remember correctly."
0,"Bring back team Canada for an adventure map, that‚Äôll work to get those views üòé"
2,I would love another superhostile series. I genuinely think it could work specifically because it‚Äôs different from the high pace of everything on youtube these days.
0,"It would be awesome to watch you play a newer CTM map, with whatever editing style you prefer. Some of those maps are seriously impressive"
0,I would even just take raw footage of a super hostile map too. I used to love when you played with Beef and Pause on the super hostile maps.
0,It's crazy how an influencer from back in the beginning dark ages of Minecraft in YouTube itself is still flourishing in this crazy economy today that is the algorithm‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ love you Etho keep bringing it out man!!!!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üò≠
0,"Hey Etho, I used to absolutely love your ark series and pixelmon series, something about you learning and mastering the mechanics of a new game was always entertaining. Would you consider another short-ish survival game lets play. Maybe something like Satisfactory or The planet crafter, or maybe even the new Cobblemon mod."
1,i love how etho's reaction to doing something cool in the game is an evil laugh 12:28
0,"I wish java had trident killers, awesome solution you made Ergo."
0,would among us be considered one of those one off uploads? üòÖ
0,"So i understand the reason for throwing the splash potions, that way you also get the looting effect.

However couldn't you stand on a pressure plate to activate the dropper system before tossing them into a water stream and have them drop into the the first piston water column?

Also why did you not hook up a shaulker unloader for all of the potion ingredients including an auto crafter for the blaze rods to be distributed to all of the brewing stands for easy of refilling the chain brewing system."
0,"Hey Etho, I think that the healing potion may be hitting a zombie piglin that is falling down the chamber. This cause it to explode higher and one block back."
1,"Etho have you ever seen the game Noita, looks like terraria mix with programming wands... It also has a lot of secrets"
0,33:09 swords rendering timestamp
0,"I would definitely watch a playthrough of a CTM map. I think many Ethogirls like myself often go back to rewatch your past CTM maps (I think I rewatch Ruins of the Mindcrackers 5 times already).

A long video with timestamps would be a nice format, maybe in a non-spoiler form like ""Chapter 1: Introduction"" so anyone can jump in easily to the part they want."

1,5:57 ETHO! is that a guitar amp in the bottom right? do you play guitar? i know it's not your style but you have to share sometime!
1,To improve your performance you should get some clientside mods. Either nvidium or a pack like simply optimized. They do nothing other than performance tweaks that really allow minecraft to use your gpu.
0,"now the setup has been upgraded, would you look into Buildstone upgrades? try animating the world~~"
1,Do you actually need lvl 2 healing potions if the pigmen are 1 hit?
0,Etho the wool carpets block the elytra noise from the sculk sensor
0,"If you are not sure about the performance of a game/map you can always stream it for a few hours, the slow content fit that better. I would definitely watch three hours and more happily<3"
0,"Project ozone 2 is maybe my second favorite series you've ever done. Also, we just got an air fryer. Highly recommend."
0,"I don‚Äôt know about other people here but I like the ctm (team Canada) and hostile map episodes. Although I understand the audience isn‚Äôt there for them. I would love to see some one-off eps. I also don‚Äôt think eps need to be 40min and have a massive build in each one, but I digress. Cheers ya‚Äôll, have a good day!"
1,"I‚Äôm pretty sure, as long as pigmen are Agro when they die, they drop XP. So Minecart entity cramming is a great way to kill them. I‚Äôd have to test, but the potions might not need to be player thrown as long as you can keep agro on the pigmen (keep one in a cage with line of sight to you in the farm)"
0,blanket is too big. I used towel in my chair.
0,Thanks for the great video computer nerd.
4,"OOGE is how I got my wife to watch and play Minecraft. At the time, we just met and thought you and Bdubs were the best. She still watches to this day because of that series."
1,"Do you plan on playing terraria again? The ‚Äúfinal‚Äù update for terraria is set to come out soon and I loved watching you play it in the past. Even if you played it alone I‚Äôd still get a ton of enjoyment out of it, but maybe you could do it with a hermit like iskall perhaps."
0,"35:00 
On the map stuff, I see what you were describing as a very successful format for a lot of twitch streamers, where they'll do one big edited hour-long mega compilation of all the streams they did playing a game. I see no reason why that format couldn't also work for a Minecraft map!
I think people do still enjoy some of that longer/slower content but they prefer it severed up all at once as something they can binge, as opposed to broken up into tons of tiny 20 minute vids. When it takes time for this slower stuff to come out people can loose engagement, but if it's something peeps can choose to sit down and take in all at once, they'll appreciate it more!"
0,One-off videos would be awesome!! Love the idea of doing a CTM map in the future too!
6,"My favourite series were always team canada slowly adventuring through maps/modpacks. I've forgotten how many times I've watched sky factory and captive minecraft. Not to mention ethos solo content too (ie project ozone 2). So I speak for myself when I say I love the slower pace videos, specially when you're enjoying yourself and not worrying about video timers and progress. But I also understand the need for growth in the youtube landscape comes at the super-action-packed-short-videos cost and, as always, I'll support you in whatever you decide. Much love Mr. Slab."
0,Are you going to pass on this world to your spouse?
0,"I watch your videos for YOU, Etho. Do what you find fun, whether that be long-form videos, series, or one-off videos -- I (and many others!) will be there."
0,"We have the same setup üòÖ, what did you do with the old one?"
0,"For the superhostile idea i think it would be a good idea to edit them down into one long video. I have been watching one youtuber do Rimworld runs (AdamVsEverything), which can take 20-40 hours, he takes the footage edits it down to a 2-5 hour video of the whole run. I find the format really nice"

My question for you is completely unrelated to Minecraft but do you have any sports teams that you follow at all? As a Canadian I would make a guess you might be a hockey fan but are you possibly a blue jays fan or a fan of any other professional sports? Just a thought. Thank you for the continuous effort myself and many others appreciate it more than you might ever know."
0,What we really need is team canada playing maps together again!
0,Seams like you'd be getting robbed a whole map in one episode. I could see a short series. Find a good balance type thing. We see you playing other games with people it would be nice to see your perspective.
0,prob still using the tissue box mic stand and 90 degree mouse with that new computer
0,I feel like etho is the kind of YouTuber that doesnt have to worry about the dreaded algorithm.
0,"I don't want fast, I want another expert skyblock series."
2,"Etho, we know YouTube's current encouragement is for faster content, but we also watch you to have that slower paced chill time, I think your audience will be fine with another superhostile series being how it was!"
0,An upload two weeks after the last? Am I dreaming?
0,Dare you to do the 404 challenge again!
0,"I absolutely have always LOVED any team canada ctm map adventures. I really enjoyed starblight deserts that you guys did recently. I haven't seen a solo run of a ctm from Etho yet, but I know I would love to see it."

0,"Hey Etho, 
i was eating a really good salad while watching this so i just auto piloted
Guess ill just have to watch the video all over again 
yay me"
0,Yes Etho! Do a map series! We would love it
0,Do you debloat windows before you set it up? If so what do you do?
0,"I am so surprised (and humbled) by your setup. considering the amount of time you spend on your computer (from what I know), you rock a basic wireless Logitech kb&m, itty bitty mouse pad, and 3 different monitors. Who knew that was the setup of the man who has the longest running Minecraft LP world/series"
0,what a god
0,"coincidentally I was just thinking about the days of OOGE the other day because another channel I watch is revisiting an old vechs map, and while you could be right that the majority of the minecraft audience might not be looking for that sort of thing, I know I definitely enjoy watching people going back and taking another look at that era of the game both for the nostalgia hit and to see how they tackle the challenges with the knowledge we've gained (or forgotten, in the case of changed mechanics) since then"
0,I don't know what is like it my absolute favorite memories of etho are crash landing and terrafermapunk plz more i enjoy your problem solving in systems you understand but haven't used and don't fully know after 10+ years. It's really something beautiful.
1,"I fondly remember my excitement every time a CTM or Project Ozone 2 episode came out. 

Beyond that, I've really enjoyed seeing Etho pop up in other people's streams, both for Minecraft and other games like REPO. The friendly, laid back nature and feeling that I'm playing the game along with everyone is something I feel modern youtube is severely lacking. If that's an algorithm thing, I understand. I just personally feel sad because it's like there's a content drought for the style and pacing I want. Luckily, the explosion of the ""forever world"" has seemed to bring a lot of small creators out of the woodwork who do play the way I enjoy watching. 

Anyway Etho, if you're in the comment section reading, thank you for being a consistent source of excitement and creativity. I always look forward to whatever you create since you break down mechanics and play games in such a cool way."
1,Hiking the Appalachian trail from Georgia to Maine and still gotta make time to watch!
0,"Hi Etho, very long time viewer. I first found your channel though your first blaze farm video.
I was wondering if you‚Äôve ever considered going back to your roots and making a tutorial video on the basic redstone components you commonly use in your projects.
I‚Äôve mostly played modded Minecraft, but I‚Äôm getting back into vanilla and finding some of the more complex redstone builds a bit challenging. For example, my item filters often break when too many items pass through them. I can‚Äôt figure out why.
I noticed that your item filters worked flawlessly on your gold farm. Even when overloaded, the filters didn‚Äôt break and the excess items made it to the end of the line.
I know you‚Äôve showcased a lot of your redstone builds in your videos, but Minecraft has changed quite a bit since then. Also, to be honest, I didn‚Äôt really understand it at the time‚ÄîI was a lot younger back then. Wilson anyone?
anyway was just hoping that you would think about it. keep up the great work. I always look forward to your vids."

0,"Etho I'd love to see some of those videos ideas. Considering the editing cost of playing adventure maps, you might be able to get away with having a part 1 and a part 2, a CTM could be an intersection every episode.

That being said I'm not a YouTuber, so you probably are right about the single videos thing"
0,Anyone else decide to try draping a blanket over their computer chair? I think my life has changed forever. For the better.
0,"Canopy carnage is how I found the channel a long time ago, I would love to see another super hostile"

0,Please play superhostile
0,"Etho, have you thought about playing FTB again? Maybe a server with direwolf? I think you guys could do some cool stuff!"
0,"It wasn‚Äôt really a map, but I also really enjoyed your Crash Landing series a while back! Regarding super hostile maps, I think if you edited it similar to your long form Decked Out run, it could work"
0,"Hi, when might we see the game series come back? Thanks for the entertainment"
3,"Etho, would you consider playing some other games? Looking back at the terraria is EZ series, don‚Äôt starve together, and ark survival videos, as well as the terrafirmacraft series, I remember enjoying watching them after school from when I was a kid and even until I graduated. I‚Äôd eagerly grab a snack and would watch them with my younger brother. I‚Äôm glad the tissue box made it along for the ride aswell!

Also we love your long form content!! Last year watching your runs of decked out were awesome, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd have a lot of traction if you chose to complete a playthrough of a map and post an extended version!"
0,Does new computer mean running up s2 of modded Minecraft again‚Ä¶üòè?
1,It is so fun watching Etho get so happy over cool contraptions still! Been watching for over 10 years now and love seeing that joy still! Thanks for all the great videos üòÅ
5,I‚Äôd watch a 3 hour livestream replay of Etho. Who wouldn‚Äôt?!
1,"After 13 years of watching Etho, I noticed the Peavey amp interpreting he strums a guitar to some degree. Love building small pieces to the Etho lore."
1,"So glad you got yourself the new computer, you definitely deserve it. Gotta say that gold farm modification was super cool, just what I expect from Etho. I think that would be an interesting idea to put it in 1 video, but I do feel like it's a lot of work for just one video, but thats up to you. Keep up the great work!"
0,"would love to see a super hostile series, i would love to see it"
1,It literally blows my mind that i use the same keyboard as Etho. It just proves he has great taste. I have used this keyboard over a decade and I love it. Great feel and fuctionality.
0,"I personally would like it if you did a whole video series/playthrough of the map, like with OOGE or Team Canada. I don't mind the slower, longer form content because it means that the shenanigans last for longer. On a completely different note, I remember how much you enjoyed the Terrafirmacraft stuff and was wondering if you'd be willing to try Vintage Story. It has a similar, more realistic crafting system and a whole bunch of other neat things."
1,I agree with the one-off videos. I think everything being tied to a series leaves you with the burden and obligation of continuing that progression all the time.
1,"I love your videos etho. Thank you for doing what you do, I hope you still like making videos and playing, because I know I enjoy it so much. What‚Äôs your favorite episodes or projects you‚Äôve done? I remember how much I enjoyed episode 404, but I also really like watching the nexus project too"
0,"Have you ever considered revisiting and/or spiffing up the _really_ old parts of your world that have been ignored? Like, I want to see something happen to the Nether village from ages ago, or the Emerald City, or that old overworld piglin farm, or the Project Pokemon stuff, or the cow fishing station thing, or the snowflake iron farm. Not to mention the huge projects which seem to have been ignored even at nearly complete stages, like the library or the oh so famous Nexxus. And of course the amplified area and the End portal base seem to have been totally forgotten. Even if some of these no longer work, serve their purpose, or otherwise make sense to use, some closure would be kinda nice."

0,"Hey, Etho, I'm curious, will you ever have another long-term gag or return character like General Spaz again? I also miss when you, Pause, and Beef used to do Adventure maps and Monument maps together."
0,Okay Etho I want your opinions on the Minecraft Movie
0,"35:53 honestly I hate that the norm is to fast cut everything. I miss videos where there was silence and you can really take in what is happening. I don't think there was more than a couple seconds in this episode where you weren't talking. Not saying I don't want you to talk, but the fact that silence pushes viewers away is just sad. I would love to see you struggle, watch you think and focus on something. I know I'm not the majority. Would you ever consider doing uncut (or less cut up) videos? Maybe on a second channel?"
0,Not putting redstone on stone slabs smh

0,I don‚Äôt recall the super hostile maps but I really enjoyed watching the CTM maps series‚Äôs and seeing in detail you going through them bit by bit and watching 10-15 episodes per series like that for a couple weeks
0,"Hi Etho. Been following you since 2010. You‚Äôre the reason I got into Minecraft in the first place. I also play just because I love the game and if I have friends to play with or not im still playing here and there. Honestly this game has been my greatest investment, buying it at 5$ over a decade ago. Just want to say im happy for you for treating yourself and getting a new computer cause I just did it myself a few months ago. Well deserved man and wish you the best. ‚ÄúFrom northern New York‚Äù. - basically Canada"
1,My favorite part of you playing the multiplayer super hostiles was that it was multiplayer. You had a lot of fun with the guys. That was the best part. The newer PVP series that you do and the multiplayer stuff in general is pretty enjoyable. It's an IRL sitcom.
0,"Could you add a system to dropper any gold that comes through the portal back through? It should come through the wrong direction, and then you should be able to put a dropper facing the same direction as the potions to put the gold back into the farm collection area."

0,Is anyone else surprised that Etho hasn't given Linux a try yet? It feels like a very Etho thing.
0,"Hey Etho! For the pigman farm, do you think it would be more efficient if you used lingering potions? Might be a useful application for them since I feel like they are often forgotten. Of course this would require a large supply of dragons breathe."
0,Post the among us footage! Unedited!
0,"no coaster under ur coffee,,"

0,Ergo I saw that Peavy in the corner of your office setup! Do you play guitar these days? I used to have a peavy like that when I started playing 15 years ago :)
0,Speaking of one offs I loved your point and click wacky computer game play throughs like Sam and Max hit the road.
1,Would you ever consider doing another series or playthrough of a game other than Minecraft?
0,"In terms of editing a superhostile video so people don't lose track, it might be worth looking at how Joe edits things like ravager rush! He's very good for setting up a map + focused layout that really enables understanding.

(also I will watch any etho video anytime you could put out a 2hr description of blocks you like and I would watch. Etho videos are comfy ^^)"
0,"Etho, if you want ideas on how to condense a video with an abundance of content, you could check out Minecraft hunger games / purge Youtubers. Sword4000 comes to mind but there are plenty. Minecraft hunger games is day long and purges take a few days worth of real time to play, but the videos get condensed into 1-3 hours. 

I think they basically cut all the grindy stuff. Notably, they introduce a new piece of action with a preface, then show the action, then have a conclusion to that scene before moving on. Sometimes they drop hints for future scenes, like saying, ‚Äúthis decision would come to benefit/hurt me very soon‚Äù. They also do part voiceover and part live.

I think their model might lend itself well to the idea you had with hostile maps content. They never seem like they jump around too much, but there‚Äôs enough cuts that it would still fit the mold of Minecraft videos for today‚Äôs viewership."
0,"I would love a film version of a play through with good editing! I'd certainly check in on the series version too, but YouTube films are defo the way to go"
0,"I'd be so happy to get a replay of some of the CTM maps!! I just finished a rewatch of a couple of those series a few months back. I'd much prefer longer form content over shorter form edited down into 1 video things. I saw someone mention a second channel ‚Äî if it wouldn't work from an analytics perspective, maybe something like a second channel would be good for it?"
1,5:55 Thank goodness I was worried
0,The tissue box surviving is so funny.
2,24:20 can you put snow layers in the nether without them melting to get that perfect height between a trap door and a slab?
0,"Etho, is that tea in your mug (if so what kind?) or do you drink your coffee with THAT much milk?"
0,Have you ever considered a 2nd channel for longer form vids like Super Hostile?
1,"Etho, I think maybe some of the inconsistency with the potions has to do with the timing of the pistons on the trap. If you watch back, when the pistons push the pigmen into the center, a lot of them jump. I think perhaps the potion is being blocked by a pigman and unable to hit the center shaft, reducing its splash radius. Setting the pistons and potion on a slightly different timing may solve this!


In regards to the comment of the day, I would love to see the single video format! There's a creator I watch that has a similar editing style to what you're suggesting - The channel, Spoonkid2, edits down hours or days of playing Rust into a digestible length. Obviously the content is quite different, but it might still help! <3"
6,"I would love to see a return to LEGENDARY!  It would be really interesting to see how it holds up, it's been so long since it came out"
0,"you can add a counter in the overworld which counts to two, then send 1 item every 13-14 seconds, this keeps the chunk loaded all the time, but makes the mechanism trigger less frequently
you can also pipe excess rotten flesh to trigger it, so no fear of it ever running out of items"
1,I thought the removed getting looting from every player kill when holding a sword thing and changed it to only appky the looting if the sword is actually used for the kill.
0,If any potential sponsors are watching...Etho deserves a new desk.
0,"Man, it feels like yesterday that the episode 500 world tour came out. I‚Äôm glad the tissue box survived all this time!"
0,Hey Etho! Is making these goofing around episodes where you don't have a strict plan easier for you than more structured videos? I love all your content but I'm constantly thinking if there's any way for us to get you to release more videos and maybe there's something we would enjoy as much as your other stuff but is less work and stress for you to make :p
0,Did Etho just say a Nvidia 1460 hahaha
0,"I started watching your videos over 12 years ago now.
I've watched nearly every video you have released since. I would love to see more CTM/super hostile maps they were some of my favorite content.
maybe team up again with Zisteau haha"
0,"24:33 did you try snow layers? I wonder if that would be shorter than a slab, but still prevent the babies from going through"
3,I would LOVE to watch you play through legendary again. What a throwback that would be!
0,hi etho
0,"Hey Etho with the potion chain system, if the Zombie pigmen are 1hp is there a reason why the potions need to be Health 2 and not just regular ones?"
1,I would watch the hell out of Etho playing Blue Prince
1,"Hey Etho, I think it would  be cool to make a selective chaining autoobrewer, you determine which potion, the levels and modifiers, and how many you want and it spits them out at you or loads them into a chest/shulker. I think something like that could really revolutionize  the potion brewing system people have"
1,Use honey blocks to make sure the piglins to stay put
0,So glad about the tissue box mic stand!
0,"How long have you had that desk? It looks nice. I really like my L shape one. It has plenty of moving space underneath with is a much needed for me, But it has no drawers. Which I don't really need."
0,"It is a shame Adventure Maps almost went completely extinct in the Minecraft Cultural Zeitgeist, I loved them back in the day. I wonder if part of the decline was the adventure update making the game much easier and combat less punishing due to health regen. Would be interesting to see someone make one in a modern beta mod like Better than Adventure, motions sensors and spikes seem perfectly fit for a map like that."
0,"How about some A B testing?  Stream it using youtube live.  Upload a copy that's edited LONG, and then edit one edited as short as you are already thinking.  One with the most views after a month is the new format?
The nice thing about stand alone vids is they give new people a place to enter the channel.  Folks don't randomly click a big number in the middle."
0,"Hey Etho. What a lovely surprise to have another video. I am putting my SkizzleCraft Halloween roller-coaster on to a flat world. Unfortunately the Nether part I can‚Äôt join up however I am adding it to the Overworld. Going to have a link in my video so people can download it and ride it. I really want to see people ride it. I love seeing reactions from people. Which is partly why I watch you. Your reactions to builds, events and new Minecraft update are the best. Looking forward to your future goofy videos. Having creepers activating pressure plates connected to a slime launcher is so funny. You hear them sizzle a couple of times before they die. Was thinking I might make a farm using this idea. Wish me luck."
0,"The potion thrower in the overworld has one of the most random set up üòÇüòÖ ""two sea pickles""
Nice episode Etho. üëè"
0,"Etho, if all of the pigmen are at half a heart, the splash potions didn't really need to be strenghtened to Healing II. Isn't it a waste of glowstone? It doesn't increase the area of the splash as far as I know."
0,"Why didn't you keep the timing of 18.5 seconds? if you stagger the potion to be more than 4 seconds after the item, would the potion not also reset the 15 second timer?"
0,"With your new PC have you considered going to modded again? I forget if you ever shared your reasoning for focusing on mostly vanilla and the existing series. and while you did address the ""goofy"" content and one-offs/short series for maps in this video's COTD, I don't remember when you last talked about modded and other content."
0,"Glad you got a new monitor, it was the biggest upgrade for me when i did mine. It is LITERALLY the thing you stare at, after all. When my buddies talk about PC upgrades I always recommend it"
0,"Would you ever consider building a Race For the Wool style game in the Hermitcraft gaming district? (Obviously in survival things would have to be different... but the core idea of parallel courses, interfering with the opposing lane, and having to return wool to the start would remain the same...)"
0,"Hey Etho, if you are setting up windows 11, I strongly recommend using Chris Titus utility. It's a script you run from windows power shell that lets you install stuff, customize and debloat windows 11 easily. You can google Chris Titus, he has a youtube channel as well."
0,"Hi Etho, have you considered starting another Terraria series at any point? The game has changed quite a bit since you and Zisteau last played in 1.3, and another pretty significant update is on the way (1.4.5). I'd love to see you two try to beat the getfixedboi seed on master mode though it is extremely tough. Great video as always :)"
0,7:20 etho almost falls into lava
0,"Regardging the Cotd and people not liking longer Minecraft content, that just isn't entirely true. I know of at least one Minecraft focused youtube who has recently put out a set of videos on a superhostile/vechs map, and I know others do similar for different Minecraft maps. and they maintain a good portion of their audience for those videos, because with established creators such as them and yourself, the audience comes for the creator and how they interact with the game, and don't necessarily care if its long or short content."
0,Add a little pit in front of the portal so any baby pigmen going through dont interfete with any redstone. Just some lava in front. Also removes items accidently sent through the wrong side.
0,"Well you know etho, streams are where you could play some of the slower stuff that wouldn‚Äôt perform well on YouTube and then later you could edit down the recording for a video"
1,couldn't you just fill the water in the overworld? like make a portal that gets empty bottles on one side and drops back filled water ones on the other... would have been cool to literally split the brewing to 2 parts instead of just doing it in the overworld
0,Legendary!!!
1,"Hey Etho, I have been seeing the same concept starting to be picked up by alot of different gaming creators here on youtube. I think doing supercuts is what it might be called? of recording x amount of content, then posting videos of it being condensed and showing more like a live interactive timelapse, or something around those lines. though I would agree, it could be tricky to do those with certain games or content etc. I agree it will be about finding the right balance for it to be successful. and I personally would love to see like possibly 12 hours of gameplay condensed down to like 3 or 4 super cuts of an hour's length video or could even cut them again into around 30 min episodes etc. Anyways, Thanks again for another wonderful upload of the LP. Keep Safe and wish you best luck."
0,A thought you could move the nether portal and send the potions through as items instead of entities so that way you could aim and not lose drops
0,I loved the series on legendary. I've gone back and rewatched it like 3 times at this point.
1,Seeing Etho play superhostile again would be amazing. I've been trying to get my old minecraft friends from school to revisit them with me. Maybe you could stream parts of it and cut it down into a couple of videos?
0,He said it!! He said it guys! _Legendary_
0,33:10 do this with other items please
0,"I've been subscribed for probably about 10 years or so now. When I first started watching I hadn't even started middle school, now I'm about to start Graduate school to get my master's degree

At this point I'm more here to watch _you,_ Etho, more than I am whatever game you're playing. Personally, I'd love to watch you play some old Super Hostile maps since they're super nostalgic for me, and I think doing them in one super long (2.5-3 hours maybe?) video would be awesome. Similarly, if you ever decided to play a different game all together (Terraria 1.whatever is EZ maybe? ü•∫A girl can dream), I'd be more than happy to watch that too. But ultimately you do whatever works for you. Your videos have been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember, so whatever you need to do to keep them coming is perfectly fine by me"
1,The real spec we want to know about your setup is which brand of tissue box you are using now? Edit: I should have been patient
0,"Just the other day I was trying to work on something exactly like this stasis chamber that only dispensed one entity at a time. I'm lucky Etho just showed me how to do it XD.

Anyone know where the idea to line up pearls/potions with a sea pickle and weighted pressure plate originally came from? I googled for a while and couldn't find anything even though I knew I'd seen the concept before."
0,Finally haha
0,"Thank you Etho for the idea of using a tissue box on my microphone. It took a bit of adjusting to get it on my headset microphone, but since then it's done a great job stoping outside noises from getting picked up. Revolutionary!"
0,"Great video as always Etho! I was just wondering if upgrading the potions to Instant Health 2 is necessary?  The pigmen should be one hit from death anyways, no? You should be able to save a brewing step and glowstone dust by just using Instant Health 1."
0,I love when you guys do ctm maps
0,Double mice; now we're talking!
1,Perfect mix of redstone/action.  I could actually understand what your redstone was doing with the potion pusher.  Some things like the brewer go above my head at face value.  Thanks Etho
1,would the potions have to be healing II if all the piglins are at one half heart?  would healing I not suffice?
0,Engagement metric thingy
2,"As long as we‚Äôre talking about reminiscing, I would love to see some PVP content again. The videos we got back in the day came out of nowhere with very little context, and I always would‚Äôve liked to see that aspect of Minecraft get a little more time in attention."
0,"Talking about your old content Etho and doing another challenge map. If you did play one to be edited into one vid, could you please upload the whole challenge for those who do enjoy the entire playthrough ( like me ) also would you bring in other creators like Beef and Pause or maybe B Dubs would be up for it."
538,"35:55  I personally still love the older slow paced style, and am sad that there are very few people that do it anymore."
0,Hope you upgraded to a high performance tissue box as well
0,Mannnn canopy carnage was a blast from the past üòÜ
0,"As per the comment of the day, I would LOVE to see another super hostile series, or really anything! Some of my favorite series you‚Äôve done are the Super Hostiles, Sam and Max, and Don‚Äôt Starve - I really feel almost anything you do you will be enjoyable to watch ‚ù§"
0,"I needed this video today, horrendous day at work but my lunch break was great thanks to you!"
0,"Etho, do you think you‚Äôll ever start up another modded let‚Äôs play?"
0,"Etho please play some CTM Maps. I love your older ""easier"" content. OOGE is some of the best content I've ever seen. I disagree with you on people lose focus, I find its like breaking up streamed content into smaller chunks and I do think streamed content does well. Look at Decked Out 2, plenty of hermits streamed that and it did well. I understand why you don't want to stream but I don't think long format Minecraft videos are universally boring."
1,"Howdy Etho! Would you ever consider playing Ark again? I remember when you played and the great fun I had watching the episodes. Also, with the new PC, you could probably run Survival Ascended"
0,Only 8 more episodes to another world download üéâ
0,"Ooo, edited maps would make it waaay easier to watch. I used to be bad at sitting through them back in the day."
1,"I always rewatch the OOGE vids you have and still enjoy it very much, and would always think ""i wish he'd do a series like this again"" but one off vids sounds great too :D

I've heard you mention iframes again in skizz's stream today, and in one other stream then you mentioned fromsoft games... and that got my ears perk up lol have you played any fromsoft games? would love to see you play that! I played Sekiro and man was it hard my heart would be pounding when I defeat a boss ;--;"
0,I love this guy for years
0,I would love to see another Terraria let‚Äôs play but I get why he would want to do one cause of views.

0,why is Etho's office So elegantly *brown* ? üòÖ
0,For ideas on how to make a single video out of a super hostile map take a look at someone like The Backlogs who does this for dark souls and other games. The videos end up being longer but are pretty enjoyable
0,"If you want to be really complicated you could do a witch and illager potion throwing mechanic. 

Edit: I didn't realize he needs to throw the potions to get experience"
0,Even the backup mouse is sideways smh
0,"Its always a treasure when Etho uploads. Absolutely love your vids. I think you might be the only minecraft youtuber I am still subscribed to. Been subscribed for years, and I have no intention of changing that. Love even just listening to your videos. Been rewatching project ozone and terrafirma punk recently. Hope to see another modpack someday!"
0,"If you do some maps it would be cool if you did a stream, or also offered a VOD version instead of just the cut version. I remember playing Canopy Carnage with my friends back in the day, I remember the actual map being so cool. You wouldn't even have to worry about being ""on"" all the time either, Decked Out, even while you were sick and not talking was always a blast to watch."
0,Need a new world download soon!!
1,"Hi Etho, I couldn't help but notice the Peavey guitar amplifier to the side of your setup. Are you practicing guitar while working in Minecraft?"
0,Office mouse without a mousepad certainly explains the geriatric movement
0,"Etho, consider starting a second channel! Stress free way to upload content other than main channel stuff, no viewer expectations at all!"
0,"When youre thinking about what to show or not it would be cool to see timelapses of your off camera building sometimes. 

I know people like smallish beans does that with some of his builds"
0,I would love to see a super hostile playthrough. It could also be nice as a novelty to see an old older version of Minecraft. I don't think you should trim too much of the fat though. It's fun for something like that to watch the process as well as the highlights.
0,Have you considered trying out Vintage Story?
0,are you gonna be able to go though an entire map in 1 or 2 days? superhistile maps are long even if ur going fast so this might be more work for one big video
0,you play guitar?!
0,"So etho has a guitar/bass amp at his desk, which is awesome"
0,"Hey Etho, I was just wondering if you‚Äôve ever considered using lingering potions in some of your builds? I always thought they were a cool concept but it feels like I rarely see anyone use them? I was wondering if you had any ideas for using them in future builds?"
0,"Intel CPU and a 4060 in 2025? ‚ò†Ô∏è

0,"Hey Etho, lately I've been seeing videos from your friends pop up where you're featured in the session, even if it isn't Minecraft related, and so my question is do you record those sessions in other games, and if so have you ever considered posting them anywhere?"
0,"Hi etho, when You got your new PC, did you consider installing Linux? I have found that In recent years the linux desktop is just as good if not better for gaming than windows with all the work that valve has put in to proton. I switched over to arch linux a few years ago now, and I have found it so nice to get away from all of the ad's in windows and the the mandatory updates and its nice having a computer that does exactly what I want it too and that I can customise however I like."
11,"6:10 Etho, I cannot emphasize this enough, but if you're spending every day sitting in a chair your _really_ should invest in a proper high end office chair with every possible adjustment. Trust me, your back will thank me in the future. If your chair isn't $500+ MSRP, then you're buying a cheap chair that either will not adjust enough to properly fit your body, or it's gonna fall apart after a couple years. If you are having to use a blanket on your chair in order to remain comfortable over a long period of time, then your chair isn't supporting your body properly, and on top of short term pain that can cause long term chronic back issues."
6,"Etho, regarding the comment of the day, I think a lot of viewers who watch your videos enjoy the long series like videos. Some of my favorite videos of yours are the team Canada series and I would love for them to return. I don‚Äôt think you should worry about viewership as most of the people that watch you are already used to those types of videos. I and I think many others would enjoy map/ctm style videos again just like you made them before."
2,"After watching the recent hermitcraft video, im curious to know your stance on tnt minecarts. obviously they are very strong for use cases like your timebombs, however, I feel they are far from practical to use in a more traditional mine. Are you happy with the state of them? or would you suggest any changes that would allow them to see more use in other contexts?"
1,I love the von sway of your gaming setup!
0,No way etho got a new computer before GTA 6
0,"Ah yes, the man whose blue jeans left a streak on the wall when he slipped doing a hand stand"
0,If you don't want the potion timing to be reliant on the chunk being loaded you could setup a designated chunk loader either lower or higher than the farm.
0,You should record long sessions and just cut it up to weekly hour long videos while you play. no editing really just raw footage with vintage etho. id love to watch you play super hostile style maps again.
0,You could also have the potions shot across through a nether portal in item form instead of entity form and then picked up by a hopper. This could allow you to shoot them out of a dispener directly at the zombie pigmen to allow more precise shots.
0,Nice! Etho episode! When is Primative Technology's upload?
0,"5:55 - Sir, a second desk photo has hit the channel."

0,"Speaking of maps, Etho did you ever finish playing the Final Paradox map with team canada? I started playing that map after watching the first video of yall play it and it was incredible! It was the first CTM map I had played and I haven't been able to find a better one since. Would highly recommend finishing it even if its not for videos.  Love all you do."
0,"I would love to see more things from you, one of my favourite series was the original ARK play through with everyone. Of course YouTube isn't kind to playing things you're not known for. Would love to see a Highly edited series if that's what it takes, and then maybe uploading the raw footage on a second channel so the people who want the full series can still enjoy it"
0,Woa I JUST got my own new pc set up! What are the odds?
0,"I would LOVE a new Super Hostile series!!! OOGE and Team Canada map playthroughs were always the BEST! It's a shame Pause isn't around much anymore for more of that Team Canada goodness.

Map playthroughs are a thing of the past in terms of YouTube and I sorely miss it. Watching you play through some would be great!"
1,"I miss the old map videos. I understand how they didn't perform the best, but some of my favorite stuff from you was from maps like that."
0,"I was gonna ask about the tissue box mic stand, but I didnt expect getting an answer shortly XD"
0,You randomly speak to my soul brother lol I have the same office chair set up. Blankets ftw
2,"Hopping on aswell to say that Super Hostile would be so cool! I loved those series back in the day! 

If it happens and you decide to go for the one-video-contains-all format, I think it could be awesome as a long one, like several hours even. 
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be an undertaking to edit, but speaking for myself, and probably quite a few others from what I‚Äôm reading here, a healthy chunk of people watch your videos because it‚Äôs you, man! 

The YouTube jungle is getting messier to navigate for sure, and who knows how well such a series would perform these days, but if you ever have the surplus of energy to give it a spin, it would be very fun to follow!

Thanks for all the videos throughout the years regardless. They have been much appreciated and have brought a lot of joy and comfort! 

All the best :)"
10,"When you moved the 400+ potions and some of them exploded, it's possible that there's a very specific height where the potions are just low enough and moving downward that when they get moved by the piston they hit the underside of the pickles.

Then again I have no idea and am just spouting random theories. I absolutely loved the video!"
0,old intro?!?!
0,And can you show how to make a locking Repeater so everybody can see again

0,This video is so high quality I feel like I‚Äôm actually playing the game!

0,"Ugh havnt watched an episode in like 20 or so and when he walked into old normal cave base talking about the gold , I almost teared up I remember so vividly him doin the sheep wool farm and the potion room just mining open the room.

0,"Take this with a grain of salt because im not fact checking myself on windows' memory management policies, but repeatedly loading/unloading the same chunk likely is not taxing your hard drive. Modern operating systems use a disk cache kept in memory, to lessen the load on the disk. Additionally, the memory page may not even be unloaded when the chunk is unloaded. And thats assuming that minecraft is actually calling for a writeback with every chunk load/unload, and that the JVM actually does it, instead of saving it to be serviced en masse every few seconds. Between minecraft, the JVM, and your OS i would be seriously shocked if loading and unloading a chunk repeatedly every few seconds actually did anything to your disk. Either way, it sounds like the 14 second interval works well regardless.

Also the one-offs of entire maps sound great!! Thanks as always"
0,"Etho, what other games do you play in your free time? Have you ever played Balatro? Love the videos, can‚Äôt believe how long I‚Äôve been following the LP!"
1,"Etho I‚Äôve been watching your videos for more years of my life than not now. I don‚Äôt make it on to YouTube as much as I used to but I also check if you‚Äôve uploaded when I do. Your videos are hilarious and have a lot of attention to detail. There‚Äôs always a goal and an accomplishment, a central theme, a story, a plot. It‚Äôs not unseen, it‚Äôs very impressive and entertaining to watch! That being said, I don‚Äôt think any of us would mind looser or more casual videos! We would watch you clean up shulker boxes around your world for an hour if it meant an easier video put out for you! We love your thought process and passion for making quality stuff, the hermitcraft video where you walked us through how you make a video was awesome and insightful! 

Thank you Etho"
0,"Re: Comment of the day

While I would love to see you tackle another difficult map, your proposal for one long video doesn‚Äôt entice me. The joy of those series was the downtime/little moments. If you were to do something like that maybe doing it on stream would be best, with a VOD channel to back it up. I know that‚Äôs entirely outside your MO but I just don‚Äôt think the audience would be there for the one big vidoe"

0,"I dont think you have to worry too much about youtube metas too much. I feel like most of your audience is long time viewers. Maybe its just me because Im older but I see it as ""do I want to watch 2 reruns of seinfield or the new 45min long etho vid?""(I pick the etho vid btw). I dunno if my opinion matters a lot though because I watch a lot of ""longform"" youtube videos especially warhammer40k or elderscrolls related where each video can be several hours long and I just watch it like I would a movie."

158,As a long time viewer I will gladly watch absolutely anything Etho puts out. I've found myself watching clips of Hermit's streams with Etho in it. With that said I'm kinda glad Etho doesn't pump out content like most creators. The inconsistency allows me to actually sit down and appreciate it more. If I miss Etho I can gladly watch an old series and the videos still hold up.
1,uh oh Etho bought one of the melty CPUs
0,Does Etho still put up a world download anywhere?
0,The comment section under your videos always seems to be a positive and respectful place. Do you manually moderate the comments to remove ones that are rude or in bad taste?
1,"Yo Etho, do you need the instant health 2 if the pigmen are at 1hp? Could save yourself some glowstone?"
0,"If you calibrate a sculk sensor to a signal strength of 10, it can detect button presses wirelessly."
0,"You could also send the zombie piglin through the portal, collect them in the overworld for a while and then throw a potion after like a minute. Reducing the cost significantly."
0,"I'd like to submit an upvote for the adventure map series. Personally I would probably watch it reguardless of what format it comes in. Because you have the right kind of commentary for it.
But I must say I hate the format YouTube has become. I want the more immersive and slow series, but not many creators makes them.
I'm sure you have a lot more loyal viewers than the avrage YouTuber when it comes to these things.
Thinking of how your content used to be back when you gained the primary portion of your subs I would be surpriced if the majority prefers fast content."
0,Does the looting effect work if you hold the sword in your offhand? also i love your videos etho!
0,"RE the comment of the day, I'm a big fan of your videos and will watch pretty much whatever you post, but I do agree YouTube's current preferred form of content is very fast paced. I think there's a lot of people who would gladly watch a full unedited play-through of a map, but posting it on your main channel (where it would get fewer views than your average video) would probably hurt your standings with the algorithm. 

Would you ever consider a second channel to post content like that on, so it doesn't hurt your main channels success in the long run? I think you've discussed this before but I can't remember in which video. There's always the effort input/view ratio to consider with this type of content, where it's relatively easy to produce and you could still net a reasonable amount of views. You could spend an afternoon or so playing something silly, chop it into 3 parts and upload it straight onto the second channel.

I rarely comment on videos, but I just wanted to chime in (because I can't complain about more Etho). I'll use this chance to say thanks for all of the entertainment, keep doing you :^)"

0,lol the cute little peavy amp on ur desk
1,"Make sure your motherboard has the most recent bios to avoid the 13th and 14th gen chip degradation. It would suck to get a nice new PC and the CPU dies because of the bug Intel had in those processors. And like you said, once you kinda customize Windows 11 it's not too bad, I'd just do what you can to avoid ending up on version 24H2. It causes a lot of issues for people, I know for me personally I was constantly crashing when using OBS when I got forced onto it. I had to do a fresh Windows 11 install back to version 23H2 to fix it up and then have forced my system to stay on that version as well."

0,May be worth changing your memory allocation to 8gb from 4gb to help with those framerates when you are stress testing.
12,"I'm honestly so glad that was a comment picked, I myself was wondering about that too recently. When I was younger me and my brother watched all of Legendary and SpellBound Caves and so on as the episodes came out, Canopy of Carnage was the only one we missed initally lol but went back for. I would love to watch a series with you and/or friends tackling maps like these again or even just a giant supercut. I'm the kind of person who will pull up a 10hr+ mega FNAF stream and even rewatch it on the regular lol. Even discarding length I juat love your personality and content so I'll definitely watch whatever you choose to put out!!!!!"
0,I wonder if the bouncing piglins cause the potions to miss more often. Might want to time the pistons to fire after the potion goes off instead of before.
1,"Hey Etho,
For those videos that don't do well enough to go on the channel but you would enjoy making (or videos you don't want to edit), consider making an alternative channel. Then just connect it to this channel as a community channel and those that want it should be able to watch without it affecting the primary channel."
0,Can't you just try doing the alignment thing when your shooting them so that their aligned?
0,For the Super Hostile idea: maybe play the maps you haven't played? Vechs has made quite a few since your series. Iceolation is an interesting one using a temperature mechanic. The latest ones use a modpack that adds magic to the game.
2,"With a new computer, are you thinking of starting a new modded playthrough? My suggesstion would be Hardrock Terrafirmacraft."
0,"I'd love to see some one off videos, that'd be fun. Maybe some unique challenges like you've come up with in the past. I always loved that kind of stuff. I'd follow along, or it would give me my own ideas related to the concepts. Always scratched that creative itch for me! Still love your series too of course. Thank you!"
0,"You could hook up the junk items to the nether dropper to trigger the potions.

Been watching for a few years. In the last few months/years, I (and many others) have noticed your interest in socialising with the Hermits. I was wondering if you feel like you are missing out on real life events (such as the recent Hermitcraft charity event) and if you thought about joining them. Keep up the videos, always a blast to watch them, no matter the video! :)"

0,The ep 600 world tour video is my avengers
1,I think you are right about the super hostile maps. however I think a group doing a one of race for the wool might hit the pocket that‚Äôs quick enough and easy to edit into one or two episodes.
1,"A blanket on the chair??
Scorpio: why didnt I think of that?!"
0,"21:21 You seem nowadays to be concerned about what needs to be shown and kept in terms of us seeing you build the things. I agree that showing the finished structure like that kind of makes me feel like I have missed a lot. But I think I remember in older videos that you simply added a 2 seconds transition containing like 3 jump cuts of you placing 3 arbitrary blocks of the build...And it makes all the difference in the world! It really shouldn't because we still missed 99% of the process, but then when you present the finished build it feels like I saw it being made! I might remember wrong though, if you try that and you see it does give that effect, don't worry about it.
35:17 About the super hostile series, I don't know about the other people, but the way I interacted with them definitely must have not helped your youtube algorithm. I always waited way after you post them for a moment when I could put the full playlist in the background while doing something else, and it would usually take me 5 episode to finally get the full picture and get invested. Now, I do not want you to hold back from experimenting with edits and ideas, but to me the absence of cuts (except really long backtracks) is what gives value to the moments that happen in these series. I wouldn't feel nearly as afraid for your life when you run out of your tunnel and dodge all the skeleton arrows to get to the other side if prior to that I had not dedicated these 5 seemingly boring minutes of you carefully digging that tunnel around the spawners. You could then think ""Well then, at least let me cut out the parts where no action is going on!"" (parts when you explore areas, gather resources etc), but what is interesting in these moments is not only your voiced reactions to what you see: I want to feel the atmosphere of that place. You are playing a game we can't really play (well unless we download it too), so these moments really do give that ""I was there"" feeling when its all over. To my eyes, the most recent example when you played something like super hostile is Decked out 2, and to me your editing of the first layers with almost no cuts, then the 5 layers with a lot of cuts was the perfect balance. If you can reproduce that it would be perfect for that kind of series. Ah and with OOGE and Team Canada hostile map episodes, all of you never making cuts allowed me to use the ""viewsync"" website to watch in sync all your perspectives, and that is such an augmented experience that I wouldn't mind if such collabs are made again in the future!
Ah and about keeping viewers attention... I think that the people you are talking about is the new wave of users that arrived to the platform when youtube grew to a lot of people in the past decade, and whom simply don't consume videos like the minority of us do. But you, do you feel like losing focus when watching other people's content? Does this actually apply to yourself? Anyway to me, I think you could never bore someone who is willing to give you their attention... but you can let them down."

29,"Etho Id absolutely love to see another legendary playthrough, or you going through it again to see if it really was that tough. I was watching those videos as they were coming out back in the day. One-off videos and map playthroughs OR minecraft 'challenges' can be an excellent avenue to getting new viewers. Things like skyblock, one block, speedrunning, getting the credits to roll with restrictions in place, etc. The most interesting part of a minecraft playthrough is normally the early game, getting geared up, getting things done for the first time in that world or series. Heck, bring a couple of the hermits along for a multiplayer and that would be sure to create some memorable moments. I know its a lot of effort, and video performance may be uncertain, but I do hope I see some content like that from Etho. Thanks"

Apropos considering whether a video is worth the effort or not. How much do you have to think of that these days? Would there be consequences of a not-so-well-performing video or is that something you could allow yourself to do or ""treat"" yourself with once in a while?

Thanks for the company you've given me over lunch breaks while working from home lately!"
1,"Could you not do the same flowing water trick to keep the potion from bobbing in front of the slime block launcher? Yeah, the slime would be pushed through the water column, but that shouldn't matter as long as you delay the restocking circuit long enough. Does the water prevent the potion from picking up enough speed?

I guess you got it working in the end, but the entity separator tech seems so effective that I want to see it working in the other bubble column."

Same goes to what you were saying at the end, I've been here for more than 10 years and I'm down if you wanna do different stuff, i remember you playing ark, don't starve, cubeworld, terraria, custom maps, etc etc. And they were really good times.

If your potions are landing inconsistently because they are bouncing in the water column, you should try copying the trick from the entity separator . It uses water flowing down from above to calm the entity bouncing. You could use scaffolding or lichen to contain the water flow and not stick to the slime block. I haven't done any testing but I think it should work."
1,"Hey, Etho! Every now and then there‚Äôs a new redstone component that‚Äôs a game changer, like the Target block or calibrated skulk sensor or the auto-crafter.

0,"Ooh, there's an amp in that desk picture! I didn't know Etho played guitar!"
0,The most nostalgic etho series for me would have to be Fly Boys. I wonder if its possible to make another series like that and if it would even be popular on youtube.
0,"You wanna do a one-off, maybe look into Legacy+ mods. They have Classic+, Indev+ and Infdev+. All three are very different."
0,You could stream some maps
0,This is one of the coolest redstone devices I've ever seen.
0,Etho how dare you! That‚Äôs a quilt üòÇ
0,You said you haven‚Äôt tried how many potions can fit in the water column in Minecraft. Does this mean you create all your builds irl before you build them in Minecraft?
0,"If you use a fortune 3 pickaxe on netherward you will get 6-8 Ward for each netherward you hit ;)  it actually works for every crop type in the game, Maybe you can use it"
0,I'm going to get my first pc in august (after a lifetime of consoles) but its so hard because i dont know what anything means!! What is ram?? Cpu?? All those random numbers?? Everything??!! How do i know which one is good? I feel like a grandpa ü´†
1,Someone has got to remind ergo that the offhand exists! He could put his looting sword there and be free to work the farm with his main hand
0,I don't even play minecraft on my own hardly at all anymore but your videos are so entertaining to watch!! You're very good at explaining what's going on in your brain.
0,You're good stuff Etho!
0,"1:12 1460? 

4060?"
5,"Would love to see a modern legendary replay, or a return of those old one-off speed challenges you did for a little while - maybe even the exact same speed challenges, done on current version. It'd even be really cool to see a bunch of the hermits get together to do something like Smallant's lockout bingo, which is very similar to the speed challenges but a bunch of them all on a bingo board vs another team."
0,Etho I know it‚Äôs expensive and I definitely cried when I bought it but buying myself the herman miller embody chair is probably the best thing I ever did for my body. I can honestly play all day (12+ hours some days) and not have ANY pain at all. It made me go broke but if you can afford it then it‚Äôs a wonderful investment imo. Your back is very important and you only get one lol. Also they have a 12 year warranty which is awesome
0,"I'd love to see another Super Hostile video!! My favorite was Spellbound Caves! And, yes, I'd love more one-off videos :)"
0,I bet etho shreds with that amp
0,"Setup is looking very CabinCore with the brown tones and the quilt! 
Congratulations on the upgrade. 
I'm also seeing a guitar amp, and that makes this musician happy to think that you might play in your free time."
0,Have the zombie pigman land on honeyblocks so they can't jump around and always have a default position.
2,That it has been over 10 years since the auto-brewing and lab build really hurt my brain. I mean yeah it feels like its been some year's but over 40% of my lifetime is crazy
0,"Etho if you play a super hostile, I will personally watch it on all my devices thousands of times. I mean it!"
1,"Congrats on the new PC, Etho! Though, hearing you say Intel 14,700 does have me concerned, of which I can explain why after my following redstone suggestion/rant (b/c I want the first part of this to actually be about Minecraft and this video's content and NOT about the Intel controversy).

So, idk if you're still getting gold drops coming through the portal, but if you are one possible idea could be to have another line of hoppers on the other side of the Overworld portal to catch anything that spills out into the Overworld, if you have the space in-between the portal and the potion launcher & I remember correctly that hoppers don't/can't suck up throwable projectiles like thrown potions or ender-pearls. You could then either drop/dispense those items back through the portal on the same side for it to be picked up by the regular collection system OR have them snake around to be put through the other side of the portal outside of the killing & collection chamber and use them as ""fuel"" for the items that you send through from the Nether to signal the potion launcher to fire. Though honestly by that point, you could probably just not bother with all of the snaking around as much and just feed the dropped rotten flesh as the ""signaling"" items, though AGAIN *that* might not be worth it b/c with all of the snaking of items around & through the portal it should be possible to recycle the items within a closed loop so you won't have to refill it ever meaning there wouldn't be much point in trying to feeding some of the drops off into that subsystem.

...
Regardless, as for why I'm concerned for Etho & his PC, this is just a paraphrasing of how I remember this narrative being told to me, but the core controversy surrounding Intel and their CPUs is true. 
For those unaware, in either the 13th or 14th generation of Intel CPUs there was a discovered issue in which basically these CPUs would overheat themselves to the point of self-damaging themselves, as in literally melting themselves alive essentially, eventually destroying themselves until they were inoperable anymore and possibly even wrecking the CPU slot on the motherboard as well! However, after people tried to tell Intel this AND they eventually investigated their own parts to find the same results, Intel still ignored the problem, even stating at the time that there was NO heating issue (as a lie), and then release their next generation of CPUs, either the 14th or 15th gen, which *still had the same overheating problem* as their predecessors. 

It was only after this 2nd generation in a row of failures occurring is when Intel finally did anything about it and eventually released a software patch for these CPUs. I believe this patch did fix the issue, but again it was only AFTER people's machines were ruined by this mistake, which in of itself is fine, but it is the fact that they tried to cover it up and even still release their next line of products with the EXACT SAME FLAW still present in the design. 

At this point for you though Etho, it is a bit too late w/ you having already bought the computer, but I'd suggest at the very least investigating this story for yourself and verifying if you/your PC might be at risk. For me personally, I am boycotting Intel products until they can win back me and my fellow colleges' trust again, and I advocate for others to do the same if you care enough about your PC not being melted alive by willful ""mal-practice"" (as the only word currently coming to my mind to describe their actions), even if you're not buying the part directly from Intel and it is part of a pre-build like I believe Etho's was, and I'm going to be sticking with AMD processors from now on."
0,"Regarding the one episode map video idea in the end - apparently really long videos tend to perform quite well on youtube nowadays, because people tend to watch them in chunks and so it really counts as multiple views. AdamVsEverything's edited Rimworld runs are of this form. Of course, this is a lot of editing, I don't know how feasible it is when you're doing it yourself rather than having someone edit it for you."
0,"Etho thanks for these years of entertainment. It's such a fantastic thing knowing that you are still making videos and keeping this original world alive.
  I admit I'm not a constant viewer but coming back and seeing you are still actively posting is litterally keeping a piece of my childhood alive.
  Genuinely thanks!"
0,But did you get a mic holder

0,"Etho, do you play guitar? I saw that amp üëÄ"
0,I can tell he‚Äôs slowing down and that makes me so sad. I literally live for these episodes and they make my month nowadays since he doesn‚Äôt do weekly episodes anymore :(
0,"I go back and watch crash landing pretty often, and obviously teriformacraft, would love to see a new non vanilla series personally, always love seeing those as someone who plays a lot of modded games but not much Minecraft."
11,"glad etho knows it's audience, I was wondering about the tissue box"
40,"One off videos are fun. I say go for it. The repo streams that you have taken part of our a lot of fun as well. 

I‚Äôm glad the tissue box has a blanket to keep it company."
0,Hey Etho they are removing underlining in books in 1.21.6 :(
0,"Just curious, is the glowstone necessary for the healing potions? Are level I healing potions not enough to kill that many?"
0,I notice Etho no longer calls it the goon farm...
0,"For what it's worth, I mostly watch your videos for comfort rather than ideas (I don't play much anymore): you have a style of videomaking that's a really nice mix of entertaining and relaxing (and I'm sure nostalgia is also a factor :^) ). I've recently been rewatching your Uncharted Territory II series and enjoyed it, and though I'm still enjoying it in 2025 I do see what you mean about pacing. So I would certainly be really interested to see what you'd do with a CTM map in a more modern format. But I appreciate this is only one voice among many. Anyway, very much love your videos!"
0,Hey Etho! Any plans on visiting modded minecraft again?
295,"Speaking of old Etho content that holds a special place in people‚Äôs hearts - I consider Skyfactory 2.5 with Team Canada and Project Ozone 2 to be 2 of my favorites series on YouTube. I watch both at least once every 1 or 2 years. I know modded series have their challenges, but I would be over joyed to see some modded Etho content.

Speaking of which, Thaumcraft just released a trailer for their new edition and I know that you have a lot of history with that mod. Could be a fun mini-series or potentially a one-off for fun."
0,We get an Etho setup reveal!
0,!!! üéâ
0,ETHO DO YOU PLAY GUITAR I SEE AN AMP AT THE CORNER
0,"Superman does good, Etho. You doin well."
0,Sometimes I come back and catch up on the vanilla let's play it's crazy to think I've been watching etho since 7th grade and I got laid watching one of his videos in college lmao. He's like the Mr Rogers of Minecraft I hope he never changes I'll always love this guy
0,"Since we are closing in on the episode 600 mark, with the world downloaod. Are you gonna do a big labeling round of your gadgets? :P"
0,i would love some more silly videos!!!!
0,That tissue box need to be put on your YT description under your mic specsüòÇ
0,Surprised you remembered to change your channel description
0,"I've watched you since the OOGE days, I would love to see it return. It's impressive the potion brewer you made over 10 years ago held up"
1,"Hi Etho, you talked about slower paced videos not performing well. Have you ever consider making a 2nd channel? 

I would love to see that, a channel where you can be a bit more experimental and free. 
Not complaining though, I'm very happy with the videos on this channel, don't get me wrong :D 
I'm just missing a bit the variety from back in the days, and playing some co-op games together with friends. 
It was always a nice surprise to see a new game. 
I'm really fascinated with how different people play games, and you always had interesting approaches of playing them.

Anyways, I'm thankful for any video you upload. 
Keep it up, and have a nice day."
1,"35:25
Etho, you could always stream the superhostile map and THEN edit it into one episode for YouTube. I know you have talked about your concerns with streaming, such as the need to keep the steam interesting. However, I still think people would watch and nonetheless be used as an incentive to play the longer formatted games you'd like to play. I have seen you experiment with games like hearthstone, but I would think this is a bit different since there is an 'end goal' to a superhostile map; hence, an end goal to the steam."
0,"Etho! Almost the big 600! What do you think is the best episode you've ever done? And, just for the comedy, what's the worst? (Of course, there's no such thing as a bad episode of Etho Plays Minecraft, just having fun!)"
0,They are landing on the pistons while they‚Äôre falling
1,"No matter what happens I‚Äôll always want more Etho content but I can‚Äôt tell you how exciting it would be to have one off videos again. Whether it be a play through of maps (my personal favorite) or just little challenges, it would be an amazing experience to get to watch you play through stuff like that again"
0,"Thank you for the content!!!!! regarding the off-camera work and also the ""time-jumps"" you said in the end about the maps, you could intoduce them in the form of timelapse!!. (we love watching you basicaly). also if you havent check, see scar's edit from secret life in the scene he was chased by the wither!!!"
0,"Hey Etho, you know how the Minecraft title on the start screen can read Minceraft, you should title one of your episodes that and see if people notice üëÄ"
11,"I miss Vinyl Fantasy and when Etho breached. I'd watch an entire series or a single video. I honestly don't play Minecraft anymore so I don't do it for the creative ideas. Haha. I just like watching Etho being Etho. My child has started watching Etho as we deemed his Let's Plays to be mostly G rated and the longer video format feels a lot better than the shorts format. Depending on the day, he can play Minecraft on the Switch. He showed me a XP farm he cobbled together by himself and I can only assume some technical knowledge is coming from here. Kinda mind blowing to think about it time wise, but I am happy its helping to teach him to think mechanically."
0,yess i loved the superhostile stuff
0,I remember back when you got your last pc with the 2060 years ago. glad you upgraded etho
0,Etho! I noticed the little Peavey amp in the corner of your desk set up. Do you play an instrument?
0,"Just on some rough stats about a super hostile playthrough; 
A channel I watch is currently going through an old Vechs map. 
The second episode has roughly 75% of the views of the flagship series, and over twice as many views as the oxygen not include series. I‚Äôll have to see how the stats for episode 3 pan out. 
Granted it is a solo playthrough so he does skip a LOT of downtime, I think it stands that a super hostile might not be as much of a view tank as it once was."
0,Did I see a guitar amp beneath your new computer tower? Do you play the electric guitar Etho?
0,"Third and final comment(lol apologies), this however in regard to the comment of the day - that format is almost perfect to play how the hermits and martin n jimmy do the guess that build and hide n seek. Etho adding that game to the rotation would be sooo awesome. Well, whatever+Etho=Awesome regardless so i mean, no real big surprise there I suppose."
0,"ETHO please do this as the comment of the day next episode, I noticed in your office setup, you have a peavey amp in your desk. Do you play guitar, if so, what‚Äôs your favorite kind of music to play, or your favorite music in general?"
0,"I was recently feeling nostalgic and rewatched all the old Fly Boys and Survival of the Fittest, and I just loved them! Sometimes the hermitcraft group goes group mini series like the Life series, has there been any talk about doing a modded series? Nothing giant like the old Mindcrack Feed The Beast, but a solid few episodes team type game like Fly Boys"
0,^
0,"I loved the old super hostile series! I still watch them from time to time and it's intense nostalgia. Legendary is beta1.7.3 as i recall, which is kind of a popular subject on youtube at the moment."

0,Etho! If you were to do a super cut type of thing for a map playthrough: don‚Äôt be scared to do voiceover or maybe even chuck up a graphic/text on screen
0,Ethogirls rise up for the new game Etho's playing on the channel!
0,"Do the potions need to be healing 2 potions. My thought is that the pigmen are already being dropped to 1 heart so wouldn‚Äôt just a splash potion of healing suffice, then cutting out the step to make them healing 2?"
0,"Etho,"" it ended up not being that complicated"". Proceeds to make it as complicated as possible"
0,"Etho, do you feel underwhelmed by some of the new-ish redstone items like the skulck sensors and crafters, or do you just not talk about them as much? Hope you have a good day!"
0,what if you used junk items dropped by zombie pigmen to be automatically loaded into the portal's dispenser to load the chunk?
0,hell yea looks magnificent !
0,gasped and audibly cheered seeing a new video hit the feed lol I loved the superhostile videos too would be seated if you brought it back for a one off / trilogy
0,"I'd love you to play CTM maps or any other type of map. Or even just play Terraria again with Zisteau. But I don't think turning a large mao like a CTM into a one video thing would be great. First of all, it'd be a lot of editing work for you. Secondly, it'd be a loooooooooong video. And lastly, it still wouldn't be a great viewing experience. You'd probably see on your analytics that the viewer retention would drop after a certain point as we struggle to keep up."
9,"There's a few types of minecraft youtubers, ones who will ""do a bunch of stuff off camera"" and you'll suddenly be looking at a giant cathedral made of diamonds and netherite, there's the ones who will show literally everything, the timelapsers, and the Ethos who try to strike balance."
0,"hey etho, a simple solution for the potions not getting everyone might just be a few fences instead of glass near the base of the farm"
0,It's always a good day when Etho uploads.
0,YES! I love Super Hostile and it would be very fun and nostalgic if you played through one of the old maps again :D.
0,Question for Etho (or oldhead fans) did Etho ever say why his minecraft skin is Kakashi from Naruto? Was it always his skin? Just a big fan of Kakashi?
0,:)
1,"5:55 etho i need to know, whats with the two mice lol"
0,"Neurotic Goose is currently doing a lets play of a Vechs map, and I think he is doing quite a good job of editing it, if you want to see some good examples!
(Although he does voiceover, not live recording)"
0,"didn't they patch the ""looting 3 applies to all player kills"" thing? it still applies to potions?"
0,I remember when you built the OG potion auto brewing system and it blew my mind. I don't think I ever imagined myself still watching the series all this time later!
0,"Yes but etho, is your Mic still on a tissue box?"
0,I'd like to see Etho playing Create mod . The new version's storage and crafting is pretty cool and the contraptions he could make would be amazing .
32,"People also watch slow gaming and you are the perfect youtuber for that! I would watch every video that is not as edited and high attention grabbing because those are my favorites!
You have a calm voice and a calm youtube persona and that is why i like your videos so much."
0,"Hey Etho! Serious question, have you ever been tempted to do a face reveal? It must be a funny itch to combat on a daily lol"
1,"Hi Etho! Do you play guitar? ü§î
Thank you for another video ‚ù§ I haven't played Minecraft in years, but it's always a pleasure to watch your videos while having a snack after a long day at work. I think I started watching your videos at the end of the third season of Mindcrack. How do you manage to maintain such consistent creativity during these 10+ years on YouTube? Have you ever thought about stopping making videos and pursuing another career in your life?"
0,What if you did lingering potions for the gold farm. That way it would keep killing after the initial burst
0,"A lets play wood be a DREAM COMING TRUE!!! I don't watch for ideas, your play style is so far ahead of me and I really enjoy my own derpy play style. I do miss the Lets Play hangin out with my Etho style videos ESPECIALLY when nothing really significant happens!! Its just for fun!!!"
0,"The piglet problem seems like an easy fix would be to just basically raise up the portal so it's dropping from above and has that Arc that you can design at the exact position need be. But I'm not Etho* so I really can't say.


*Indicates legendary, untouchable individual(almost assuredly Etho); see also; made-man"
1,"Hey etho, have you considered making your videos even longer? It would be longer to edit but I would love to watch a longer video, and i‚Äôm sure you have the content to fill it. Also, i‚Äôm sure the other ethogirls would enjoy something like this"
0,"This upload just saved my day from ending on a sad note to ending on a happy one instead. 
Congrats with your new computer, and great to hear that it turned out better than expected üéâ It‚Äôs always so fear-inducing to change out good old equipment‚Ä¶ 
Good on you with all the world improvements and RL improvements. 

Looking forward to the new look of those valuable areas in the Nether! The slime launcher is a great set up, even though I have used these launchers before, I have never considered using it to send healing potions through a portal."
0,Etho got a new computer before GTA VI came out üíÄ
1,You will never see this but for the first 5 minutes in the video. You used a regular piston on the red stone block when you should use a sticky piston so when you leave it pulls the red stone block with it.
0,Babe wake up etho posted
0,"Etho, your fans will watch anything that you do. One-off videos would be fun!

Separately, I think that you‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised if you made a second channel similar to Grian‚Äôs, where you could upload your pov of many types of games, including Among Us 3D and R.E.P.O.. 

I‚Äôd enjoy watching your pov; especially since you usually talk pretty quietly, and those around you don‚Äôt always have your audio turned up properly. I won‚Äôt badger you about it. Just wanted to mention it."

there's mechanical keyboards that are quiet but i dont have a rec OTTOMH

0,"Dear Etho.

Here is the question of the day for you: how does it make you feel, that your world is the unofficial backwards compatibility and quality assurance test for the development of Minecraft?

Kind regards from Denmark!"

0,if the pigmen are at 1 hp why do you need healing 2?

0,hi
0,"With the comment of the day it definitely is true that people do enjoy the more creative, problem solving-y parts of Minecraft but a very large amount of people just really enjoy the creators themselves! I really think thats what a lot of people enjoy about modern Minecraft nowadays, especially when it comes to you and the hermits for example. So I really believe that map content would do alright nowadays and its definitely worth an attempt"

1,"Highly recommend a program called StartAllBack, it makes windows 11 look and feel like Windows 7 without compromising anything, its pretty fantastic."
0,Watching you build the stasis chamber i jusr cant help but think.... wouldnt a dispenser do the trick? You only have to cover like 3 blocks of distence if you place the portal well.

0,Etho please say that this means we can have another heartstone video plzpzlpzlz
0,Will happily sit through 2 unskippabke adds so tho gets the monitised money (not even being sarcastic)
0,"Regarding the superhostile question at the end. Personally I would absolutely watch it, devour it even. But that's not how youtube works anymore, sadly. So maybe you could do it like various other creators. Doing a livestream und uploading it (unedited) to a second channel. Or create yourself a patreon and upload the videos there. I would glady give you a few bucks, any maybe you changed your way of thinking about how you want to get paid and accept donations now? :D"

More fun videos are welcome!"

0,etho
7,"Do I know anything about redstone? Probably the most basic stuff. Do I still try to understand whenever you show the guts to any build you create? 100%. I love that even though half the time I have no idea what I'm looking at, you still manage to make everything entertaning and digestible enough to follow along.

Which leads me perfectly into my next point - whatever content you make, I, and I'm sure many others, would always happily follow along. Thank you for being you, Etho! Congrats on the new setup, thank you for saving the tissue box haha, and I'm excited for what's to come! üíï"

and yes please for the one-off vids !! sometimes it's nice to kick back and watch a continuing world, but other times, I wouldn't mind seeing a little one or two vid long bite into something new! It's kinda like the life series, yknow? a short thing to come back to like a movie"
0,Why not use just a pressure plate to turn off the enderboys ? Just seems way simpler and much more reliable.
37,"36:02 I‚Äôd prefer having that as a longer format. I know what you say with the quick paced, action packed YouTube, but I really love the longer format stuff. I do not have much time, and I want to spend it on things that I like, and lately that has mostly been long format repo streams of you hermits. So I don‚Äôt know but I think there is quite some of us that would also enjoy a more long format-y Minecraft map playthrough, maybe a 1h episode or something of that magnitude? You usually hit a very sweet spot with the not to much action but not too boring editing, so you definitely could pull that off. For a map I think it‚Äôs better to error on the little bit too little action rather than, too fast paced and losing the connection. 

Loving your content pretty much since the lamas started moving around sandy city, and am happy to hear you like your new setup! Have a nice day etho!"
0,"By default I include shut-offs in everything. Especially anything that operates passively.  Also, I know it is less convenient, but wouldn't splash potions be more effective? At least clearing the room. Right? I mean, those that survive, if any, will just walk into it(probably)."

 I would definitely appreciate some more one-off videos in the future! Been watching some old Zisteau videos and had the same craving for some nostalgic super hostile content. Too bad that‚Äôs not what viewers are looking for nowadays. Your speed challenges were super entertaining, so I‚Äôm sure people would love to see more content like that. Anyways, keep up the great work!"
0,If you do make a super hostile style video it would be great if you could get Zisteau to do it multiplayer
0,"Hey Etho, I was wondering if you would ever consider animating some of your world with buildstone? It seems to be pretty popular right now and I just love the energy it brings into builds and I think it would look awesome in your world! I think it would also be the perfect time to start since you wouldn't have to worry about lag with your new computer. I'd love to see what clever ideas you come up with to animate things!"
0,For the portal and dispenser maybe u could raise the water column in the overworld up by one block or lower the portal by one block so it pushes it through higher up in the portal?
0,Would items get stuck if you replacing one glass block in the middle with an end rod? Or would the potion completely miss it?
0,The Tissue Box‚Ñ¢ Stands!
0,"Hey Etho! You wanting to try maps again but wanting to edit it differently is a great idea. I would definitely watch. If you are looking for some ideas of how to edit, check out some of the popular battle royal game channels. There are several that really tightly edit server wipes into nice 1-3 episode stories. My top choice is Willjum who plays solo Rust for editing inspiration."
0,"Congrats on the new PC, that's always fun!!"
0,"Idk if you've answered this before, but in the updated setup picture, it seems like you had an AMP or something below your new pc.

Do you play any electric instruments?"
0,"i love the super hostile / map series idea. i just fear itll be a hella of a lot of editing . but if its something you do only once and a while and you really enjoy it, i think that could work!"
0,"hey etho,
bouncing off this eps comment of the day, ive been rewatching project ozone 2 and love the automaton / factory elements. any new modded stuff coming soon? especially with Thaumcraft 7 being teased recently, modded season three question mark?"
0,"Hi Etho, maybe you can prevent the pigs from jumping by letting them stand on honey blocks. Alternatively, you could do the triggering of the pistons after they die instead of before, as that's what seems to cause them to jump. Think the potions might be hitting jumping pigs instead of the middle column, causing them to miss a few on the player side of the kill chamber.

Always a delight to watch your let's play episodes (or any of your vids for that matter). Have a good one!"
1,"Hi Etho, another comment said that most of us just love to watch you and I hope you know that's true. I just went back and saw your playthrough of Terraria with Zisteau and was wondering if you have any plans for another terraria playthrough with the new 1.4.5 update about to come out? Thanks for the videos <3"
0,ETHOI!!!!
0,Not too long ago I watched your one off hearthstone videoes üòÇ
0,Etho! Saw your Peavy amp! What's your rig?
1,im so happy rn i literally just woke up and theres a new etho video
0,To make the launcher consistent and stop the bobbing couldnt you do the water going downwards trick like you did holding the potions the step before?
0,"Etho I remember you doing Cube World. I was so sad when that game stopped developing. Would you ever look into playing new games like that? Also, when you play repo would you ever consider posting that on your chanel?"
1,Hey Etho. I see a peavy amp in your desk picture. Do you play guitar?
0,Would love to see the whole map in one big video idea in the future!
1,"Hey Etho, I saw you have a guitar amplifier next to your desk. I wonder if you play the guitar? And if so, what kind of music do you like to play?"
0,Peak setup
0,I miss pixel piracy and starbound! I also wish you‚Äôd show us your factorial save and do some faster than light runs! I don‚Äôt care as long as it‚Äôs EthosLab!
0,"Hmm. what a fascinating new desk picture! We can see... far less than in the original desk picture, BUT,  in this one there is a cool amplifier visible in the bottom right. Cool."
1,I have that same Peavy amp.  I think.
1,"Hey etho, with all the upgrades you‚Äôre making, have you considered getting a mic stand :p"
0,No mouse pad is diabolical
0,"The sound seems good to me.

Shame you can't totally kill the horizontal velocity of the potion, then you could drop it straight on the zombie pigmen.

The idea of you making the nether more presentable is good. Flying to get up there can be made fancy too with nice tunnels and an easy way to get off at each ""floor"". As much as I like elevators."
0,"Etho hasn't changed a bit. All of his videos get over 400k on average, but buys himself a I-7 and a 4060."
0,I was thinking about having the potion fall from above the pigmen spawn but would probably hit them on the way down if it isn't timed with mob cap. Yours was really cool to see!
0,Didn't they remove the looting effect while holding a sword thing some patches back?
0,Super hostile and one off videos sound fun! Sounds like a lot of work to edit all of a super hostile into one video. Would you consider getting an editor? I'm sure there's plenty of more people willing to be a channel member if ads cant pay for that alone
0,5:55 Is that an amp? Do you play guitar etho? :D
0,"Does changing the type of block in the central pillar help the potion more consistently get all the pigmen? A wall block could allow the potion to break more centrally to the chamber. Additionally, if you delay the item pusher timing to be right before the potion breaks, the mobs seem to get pushed closer to the center and might be splashed more consistently. I wonder if there is a way to use the downwards flowing water meets upwards bubble column trick shown in the entity separator to reduce the bobbing of the potion in the slime launcher chamber. 

Also a new happy ghast elevator up to the iron farm? -Cheers!"
0,"Love the video Etho, I've been playing minecraft for quite a long time and always enjoyed your videos, but ive been mostly playing 1.8.9 pvp. I was wondering if you had any tips for getting more into redstone. I've always enjoyed watching your redstone projects but I just struggle when I try to figure stuff out in my own singleplayer worlds."
1,I think Vechs is still making maps!! You should have a look & see.
0,"I'd definitely watch you play through Superhostile maps, even unedited lol! Regardless of what you decide, I'll definitely be there :D"
0,How annoying to have an etho video interrupt me watching etho videos.
0,I think this first time In along time I have watched your videos. Love happiness and peace thank you for all you do
0,"Hi Etho,

would you consider playing other games beside Minecraft? I mean games you never played on your channel.

I really love all the other games - Terraria with Zisteau, Ark, Dont Starve and Pixelmon...  Pixelmon is not technically other game.

I know you mentioned that other games didn't get enough views. But some of them did. And it's about balance.

I love your videos. Thank you."
0,Holy crap he finally got a good enough camera face reveal?üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0,same keyborad?
0,YEAHHHHH TISSUE BOXXXXXX
0,"I would love more random content! I worry that one video per map would be a bit too hectic, i quite like seeing the time put into it - you probably don't need literally every moment, but if it gets reduced to a highlight reel I don't think I'd enjoy it as much. maybe 2 or 3 episodes instead? 
I would also love to see some of the 3D among us if you were recording for it! I realise its not exactly your normal content but i really enjoy watching you play :)"
0,Etho what do you do to get such large quantities of sand for glass/tnt/etc? It seems like the most difficult to mass gather resource
1,A good time to be alive
1,"Intel 14700 had some corrosion issue and had to be fixed by updating the motherboard bios, please check your bios version"
1,I would love to build you a new desk‚Ä¶ next improvement.
0,"Speaking of longer form videos, if you're ever in MCC again would you consider uploading your whole POV? I always try to catch them live, but I have definitely gone back and watched entire VODs from others"
40,"Plus one for super hostile! I just started re-watching the old OOGE videos. 

But honestly I would be in to watch you play any game! Thanks for the awesome content Etho!"
0,Its really cool to see you revisiting the idea from that enderman farm bc i thought the potion setup for looting was really cool
1,Its nice to see an Etho upload after a long day :)
0,"Ah man super hostile maps brings be back to team canada days, i miss those videos"
0,6:00 thank god we still have the tissue box
0,Only Etho would make an automatic farm by shooting potions thru a Nether portal
0,May the algorithm bless you
0,"Congratulations on the new computer and monitor! Your setup looks great.

Hope that you have a wonderful day!"
40,"36:20 as a long time viewer, I‚Äôd LOVE to watch that kind of video"
0,Can you not use honey blocks to prevent the (baby)pigmen from jumping up?
0,"I felt fear when i saw the desk photo, Ethos not a real person in my head"
0,cant get a new setup cause etho dun it
0,Why don't you add some hoppers on the overworld to catch the gold ingots and the nuggets and just throw them through the portal along with the potion?
0,We finally got a new version of ethos lab!
132,Oh thank god the tissue box survived. It wouldn't be an Etho episode without the high quality sound dampening of the tissue box.
0,upload in higher bitrate pleaseeeeeeee
624,"I like that the blanket matches the colours of the desk setup, in the same way the tissue box does. Peak interior design right there"
5,"Etho, for all the time I‚Äôve been watching you (at least 11 years bc I had the comment of the day on ep 313) you seems to be there in my life in a way that I need. Thanks for being someone super positive <3"
0,"hey, etho! i think the strategy of throwing a potion and switching to a looting sword might've been patched. they redid how a lot of enchantments work to enable data driven enchantments, and i believe looting swords no longer affect fired bow shots, and i think that applies to splash potions too. might be worth testing again!"
1,"Not sure if this was mentioned already but make sure your BIOS is up to date because the 14th gen Intel processors have some issues with degradation, and they push out some patches to help prevent issues. To my knowledge it‚Äôs more a problem with the i9 variant but it still doesn‚Äôt hurt to make sure you stay up to date with your i7 to prevent any issues down the line. Apparently they‚Äôre pushing out another patch soon because some people are still facing issues"
0,"Yer Offhand lass, dont forget about your OFFHANDDDD ITS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR 6 YEARSSSSSSSS PUT THE SWORD IN YOUR OFFHAND"
0,Do you play the guitar? pretty sure that was an amp if im not mistaken... it's incredibly cool if you do!
0,Is this a Etho first!? A real life picture shot edited into HIS video!?
0,hmm.. super hostile is good buuut cobblemon would be incredible :D
0,rtx 4060? a bit mid imo
0,"When I got my new computer, it was set up with windows 11. The first thing I did was change the settings so it looked like windows 10."
1,"7:19 Not Etho jumping off the edge, and flying over lava without rockets in his hot bar! It‚Äôs giving me Scar vibes. üòÇ"
0,You take care as well!
0,I'd be in fasvor of more 1 off videos - I loved the random Hearthstone episodes
0,Yes I think edited videos of those sort of maps are the way to go (& would love to watch them). If one of those episodes goes by and no or backwards progress has been made it can be a bit discouraging for the watcher I feel.
0,"Still so many questions about the setup. Please, how old is that keyboard? Get a nice mechanical one, you'd like it so much!

Also, what's the second mouse about? A backup??"
0,Etho got the rtx 1460 must be some special edition.
0,"Hey Etho, I see in the photo you have an amp under your desk, do you play electric guitar, or some other electric instrument? :)"
2,29:05 man dont make me feel old! Though Im only 22‚Ä¶ it definitely could be much worse but still!
0,"Etho, IF you were a potion... what effect would you have?"
1,the tissue box stays LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!
0,"Sir, a ~~2nd~~ ~~3rd~~ ~~4th~~ 5th(?) gold farm redesign has hit the LP"
0,You just lost ~9 bottles its probably fine....
0,can you give us a list of stuff you did to change windows 11 to be good? That why im afraid of updating still... <3
0,"Make sure you make a couple of system restore disks in case you manage to corrupt the installation (on that new PC)! My family is very tech literate, but we all keep restore disks just in case."
0,Funny Etho spent so much time making an afk gold harvester considering he doesn't afk lol
0,"Gotta say the increase in quality is definitely noticable in the video qualify, there's far less artifacting when moving around."
1,I was thinking about superhostile recently too! I would love to see some content like that again
0,Computer nerd here just to let you know that your CPU may be destined for failure. Recent Intel CPUs have been notorious for a very high failure rate.
0,You could probably sell your 4060 for $600 and buy a 5070 for $900 and get about a 50% increase in power
0,I enjoyed the episode
0,"Hi non-redstoner here. Why wouldn‚Äôt you just use a dispenser to throw the potion? 

My understanding is that from the brewer the potions are dispensed into the entity sorter but why not just point the dispenser at the portal? Or send the potions through as items and the have a dispenser in the nether? I know there is some randomness in the dispensed entity‚Äôs direction but is that enough to make it unviable? Or is there some other game science that prevents it?"
0,"Hey, I ran through a bunch of comments. And I guess there is no reason to change it now. But you set the mob health to 1 with the fall damage. So no reason to make health II pots. Could cut the glowstone step of the brewer. Hope you are doing well and im a big fan of yours."
0,New monitor and computer? 1440p/4k soon? üëÄ
2,I think one-episode edited down super hostile videos would be super cool! It sounds like a lot of playtime and editing work for a single video but I'd love watching it.
1,"Windows 11 is honestly almost indistinguishable W10 if you configure correctly. The only thing that still annoys me is that the Start menu is now practically useless, and of course all the AI slop."
1,30:56 kinda criminal to do the recipe on the top instead of the bottom
3,YES an office chair blankie adds the perfect lil dash of cozy to a setup. big fan of that lil office upgrade!!
0,I do wonder what Vechs is up to these days.
0,"18:22 Just a thought, you could use the rotten flesh as your item to dispense into the portal to load the potions"
0,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ etho post üòÖ
6,I know I speak for most of us at least those of us that have watch you we would love to see your pov of R.E.P.O. obviously I can't speak for the entire community but I think a fair number of people would justify you uploading it
0,"Etho! I love hearing you talk about your setup! You mentioned you got a new monitor but didn‚Äôt say what model or specs, what did you end up with? Are you ever going to make the jump to an OLED? I did earlier this year and it makes all the difference!"
0,"Oh, a thing for dealing with Windows weirdness, (I know it sounds weird) but I'd recommend ""O&O Shutup10++"", it really helps neuter some of windows 10 and 11's ""features"""
15,Whatever possible solution gets you to post you playing more maps is fine by me. A number of my all-time favorite etho videos/series are on custom maps.
0,That's Peavey Rage 158 TransTube Guitar Combo Amplifier launched in late 90s assuming he was a teenager like 15-20 when he bought it. Etho would be in his early 40s now.
74,"Etho you have one of the most kind and loyal fanbases of any MC youtuber, please don't think too much about the small differences in views. I'm sure 80% of us will watch you talk about bricks for 5 hours if you upload it. It would be so fun to see another superhostile map!!"
3,"You should totally consider recording those old maps. If you want to go a long form route, and perform well, they should probably be streamed. However, I think they could do really well on YouTube Shorts if you feel comfortable enough to try that out! I think the point of the videos should be to get people to try out the map, and you showcase all the cool aspects of the maps and not worry about showing every single thing. Keep up the great work!"
0,"I think one big ""supercut"" of a map is more enticing than 10 small episodes, personally. I'll skip a 20 minute video on a topic I like, just to watch a 7 hour supercut of some challenge on a game I've never played in my life."
127,"great episode etho, didnt even knew that 20 mins had passed until you said it, to me the episode was just starting at that point. i actually like that new potion brewer, always liked your design in the man cave, but is a design that you dont see replicated much even if i think is great (i think it has to do with potions not being that good in the game because of all the inventory space they take). now that i have seen a modern approach i maybe use it to make a giant brewer in my world.

other than that, im all for you doing other videos too,  im not a fan of the ""adventure"" maps myself, even if i have seen some series on them, but i did like that skyblock you did with pause and beef, a shame that it didnt have vein miner installed, but hey, you had minicio at least on that one as beef mentioned a couple times. it doesnt have to be with team canada, but maybe you could do another one like that too with a group, life series style"
0,"Long form content is for streams, so I think if you really wanted to play a SHM, then streaming it would be a good option, especially since you just got a new computer.

If you really wanted to edit a whole map into a single video, there is a guy called Hubble who edits whole mod packs into single videos which might contain some useful techniques for how to edit such a project."
0,"new computer thats cool

The real question is did you changed your mic stand?

EDIT - Ok you did not"
0,"ah dude legendary would be excellent, would love to see that. And some slower videos would honestly be welcome especially as a side-thing"
1,why do you need healing II potions when the pigman are one hp? Would healing I potions not work?
0,Why no more modded series?
0,if you're looking for a good CTM I played through Superstition by Ty a couple years ago and it was really good. It's hard but fair and pretty short.
1,"10:39 ""Do they go through the portal as they are falling? .... Looks like they're not pushing each other into it, so that's good!""
10:53 YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE A PIGMAN RIGHT THERE WHAT.. D:"
34,"I just wanted to mention, since you brought up the super hostile maps with that comment, Team Canda playing through Final Paradox was so much fun while it lasted. My siblings and I played along too and oh man, people are so creative! That one and Diversity 3 have been recent(ish) ones that I just loved to both watch and play along with. Thanks for the great video as always!"
0,I did like the old one off videos. It would be fun to see them make a comeback
0,"So I haven't played mc in a little while, and haven't build a machine like this so I may be uninformed, but it seemed like some of the ""misfires"" where it didn't kill all the pigmen just happened to shoot the potion right as the pigmen jumped. Maybe it happened to hit a pigmen that jumped instead of the middle causing the pigmen on the other side to be out of the range of the splash."
1,"personally i'd love to see another super hostile map play through, was some of my favorite stuff from back in the day. <3"
1,i was not ready for the nvidia rtx 1460
0,The potion going through the portal and a nugget instantly jumping back was hilarious
2,I‚Äôm guessing the reason some of the potions didn‚Äôt kill all the pigmen is because it happened to hit one of the bouncing pigmen instead of the pillar
293,I was not expecting the Victorian ankle reveal of that desk pic. My poor heart. For heavens sake warn us first ;D
1,"Hey Etho, do you have plans to play a Soulsborne game on your channel, if you are famiilar with those? Perhaps for a miniseries or a challenge run? Recently I have been really into watching Dark Souls challenge runs, and I think the clever use of game mechanics and planning it takes to play with the restrictions would be right up your alley! 
A Horror game could also be fun, I have never seen a scared Etho.
Thank you :-D"
0,would love those small side videos  showing cool maps or whatnot maybe just your recent ingame goofs too!
0,Etho setup is SSS+
0,Resin blocks are really nice for pillaring and bridging as they are insta breakable with even your fist. You might be able to make a creaking farm with the potion auto clicker.
0,farming pigmen for gold and then trading it back to em gotta be a different type of evil lmao.
1,the CTM's I always go back to watch ‚ù§
171,"If you do the superhostile map, please consider uploading the full VOD on a separate channel. I see a lot of streamers do this, where they have an edited version on their main Youtube channel and the many hours of unedited gameplay is put on their second channel. That way you can get the fast-pace edited version, but those of us who enjoy watching you stumble around for an hour can do so."
0,You need to make a big witch hut to house your new potion machine!
0,"Hope you also updated the bios, because there is an issue with 14th gen Intel CPUs that can cause permanent damage if you don't ü´°"
2,"Editing it all into one video would definitely be better. There's another Youtuber named Smallant that did a lot of that with his streams to make one cohesive video, whether it was Minecraft, Pokemon, or probably some other games that I haven't watched lol. It definitely requires more effort but people wouldn't mind a longer video like that since they could watch it in one sitting rather than having to wait for multiple episodes, watching the downtime, etc."
0,2 of the same mice on top of the desk certainly is a choice
0,"Hi Etho, thank you for the video! I'd love to see you do more maps or just other one off videos, it's always fun to watch and even if it's in a long format it's nice to have it on in the background while doing other things. I was wondering how you remember all your redstone contraptions? I'm not the best at Redstone and need to watch a video each time I'm trying something but you seem to have a knack for memorising mechanics or tools to get you by. Do you memorise the majority of them or do you have a cheat sheet that you refer to?"
2,Seeing ethos chair after all these years feels surreal

1,we have been blessed with another Etho let's play episode.
1,"I got an idea.

Right now people also watch Minecraft for stories told in the game. Scripted or not! (See Whitepine for a good scripted story in Minecraft.)

If you want Super Hostile to work, you could make an engaging story, or a ARG with bits of it in each episode to get the community engaged and to guess what is going on."
2,Etho getting a new PC! I've never been more excited for someone upgrading!
1,Ergo!!!! My day just got so much better
1,"I doubt this will happen any time soon between hermitcraft and the lets play series and appearing in streams, but next time Etho's in need of a series... I suggest vintage story :D it's like terrafirmacraft, but its own game, and more in depth!"
0,@etho i think the second shot didnt hit all pigman because one of them was jumping and the potion it that instead of the middle column.
0,Would love to watch another superhostile E
10,"I would ABSOLUTELY love to see you play a super hostile map, even without a super tight editing style"
0,Etho would you ever consider releasing VODs along side these edited down videos? Love your content :]
3,"Etho, have you thought of making a smelter for the left over gold swords?  It might help with some lag too. 33:07"
894,"Etho! Regarding the comment of the day - we would love to have more random goofy videos. It's true that people watch minecraft for creative ideas, but some people watch minecraft simply for the creators behind it (and their sparkling personalities).

1,why cant there just be a dispenser set up in place of the slime block launcher? I feel like that would simplify this a lot more
0,Is the potion portal issue due to the potion hitting the mobs first? Maybe try honey blocks on the sides to prevent some jumping? Unsure how you'd fix that.

0,I'm sorry you got an intel cpu instead of an AMD ryzen
0,"I could be mistaken, but I believe that the tool switch for things like looting has been fixed for a little while already.

4,"Not played this game in years, barely watch YouTube, but I‚Äôll always be right here for an Etho video."
229,i think it's so wild that superhostile maps never really got the views to justify making them - i distinctly remember being really excited for new episode day back when y'all were doing them more often! so sad the views didn't translate from the way i'm sure a dedicated part of the fanbase felt about them. i'd personally love to see an edited-down one-off playthrough. the nostalgia would be so real!
0,He made a trap through the portals üî•
0,"Hey Etho, I have a question for you that my friends and I have mulled over a few times in the past. If you could replace a body part with the equivalent of that from any animal, what would you chose and what animal would you take it from? (ex. replace my arms with octopus tentacles because each tentacle has it's own brain, in a sense, making multitasking easy).

Love your videos and I've been watching since I was in middle school. I'm now married and have been watching your videos with my wife every night to show her all your cool inventions and creations. And yes, we have snacks every time!"

1,Etho!! Don‚Äôt think I wouldn‚Äôt notice that amp! Do you play guitar?! üé∏
14,"That Peavy brings me back. My first amp ever in the 80's, I think it was a Backstage Plus. Grats on the new rig!"
1,I have noticed hopper clocks don't work anymore as they used to. Now I have to update the piston for it to push over the redstone block. It seemed to work fine though in your enderman farm.
1,A new Etho episode is the best thing to watch while eating breakfast!
1,at 6:10 is that a guitar or bass amp? how long have you been playing?
0,Just coming back after a long while. What ever happened to your modded Let's Play?
249,"My god. The genuine joy I feel, listening to this man talk about a folded blanket. Words cannot describe."
59,5:55 THE BOX LIVES ONüî•
0,I don't even have snacks and I'm still gonna go find some
0,So uh... Does the tissue box was still on your setup?
1,Wow I'm so early. Etho thank you for being here for so long I'm nearly 30 and have a child of my own now.
2,"My favorite number is 592, always knew Etho would get there eventually!"
1,"keeping the tissue box is unironically better than the cpu choice :( poor etho got basically scammed, hopefully his cpu doesn't die soon"
4,ETHO PIC #3 THIS IS A MOMENTOUS DAY
0,"THANK GOD THE TISSUE BOX MADE IT :D
and the superhostile idea sounds super interesting, but yeah it sounds like a massive editing challenge!"
175,Ergo does not exceed 4 folds in his office chair blanket. I can‚Äôt handle so much etho lore in such a short period of time!
8,The office chair quilt is lovely
19,Hey etho! I just wanted to thank you for all the years of wonderful videos! I‚Äôm so grateful that you‚Äôve stuck around after all these years!
1,19:06 I know it‚Äôs usually fun and efficient to use tnt but you can fortune glow stone!
0,i hope we hear about that shulker box computer thing etho talked about once many many moons ago. i wonder if it just ended up being not possible?
10,"0:47 Etho, please consider making a video about your customization on Windows 11.

I am sure I am not alone in valuing your unique creativity and approaches to problem solving.

Currently dreading the forced migration in October."
37,Etho plays guitar confirmed
1,Woah ep 592  I can't remember when was the last time I saw an episode but I would have imagined that we would have been in 700s or more by now. I feel like ep 500 was ages ago.
0,He got a new set up but didn‚Äôt mention a new mic stand lol.. I‚Äôm guessing the tissue box is still working fine.
0,MY BODY HURTS MY LUNGS ACHE WDYM ETHO PIC DROP
1,ETHOOOOOOO VIDEOOOO YEEEE
0,A 20mil per hour gold nugget farm is about to launch if etho is too worried for gold production
0,"Gotta get my snacks!
Edit: I would also love to see some old adventure maps or CTMs! Those were the best content to ever come from Minecraft, imo"
2376,"man i was 15 when i first found Etho, 26 now and i still get just as excited for an LP upload."
1,"Dear Ergo, i wish you would return to your old schedule, so that we can get to episode 1000 by the end of next year."

1,ITS AN EFFO EPISODE
5,I hope this doesn't sound weird but Etho is the first gaming YouTuber ever buying a _new_ computer with lower specs than mine...
1343,"6:12 Etho is just a dude in his office chair with a folded blanked on it and a tissue box as a mic stand
slurping his coffee and playing Minecraft.

Gota love that Guy"
2,I've never been this early to and Etho episode before. I feel blessed

4,"QOTD: Have you considered using Linux? It's a bit telling that you had to make several changes to make Windows 11 feeling good to you. Lots of people, including myself have concerns about many Windows 11 ""features"", such as the start menu ads, recall, copilot, telemetry, etc. Linux doesn't seem to have any of that, and I've heard that most games now even play better on it, including Minecraft."
3,"Glad to hear you've grown accustomed to Windows 11! Hopefully it lasts, although your history with the various OS quirks is entertaining (in some way haha)"
2,My Ethoooooooo.
0,"I assume you mean a Nvidia 4060. That still seems wrong with the performance. That's great performance out of a 4060.

Edit: He shows his F3 screen and it is a 4060."

117,this playlist is so good for sleep thank you etho pls never explode
107,I'm going to binge this playlist
0,It's to bad you can't just make a sound barrier/ sound room to block game sounds like mobs or dispensers and dropers
0,"Yep. When you have an idea for something it often takes a bunch of testing and iterations whether for functionality or esthetics. It's easy to just see the finished product and miss the heavy work, thinking and trial and error that goes into things. One of the reasons I enjoy your channel is that you show how your ideas evolve as you test them."
0,"I recommend playing Minecraft on Linux, so much performance boost. I used to get stutters and heat problems (on laptop) when I used to play on Windows now it's all gone. I use Arch, Ryzen 5600H, GTX 1650 mobile 4VRAM 24GB RAM"
0,Find you someone that loves you as much as Etho loves that tree farm (which of course he loves so much because it lets him make so many ladders)
0,Crazy to think I have a better computer (although older) than Etho is getting.
5,31:08 Etho just casually time lapsing himself making the hole while everyone is killing Jimmy. üòÇ
0,33:02 that's actually hilarious
0,rock bottom = bad dropper levels
0,"22:40 I remember reading on some Minecraft wiki that bone-mealing a 2x2 tree requires applying it to the correct sapling.  I don't remember the specific rule, but it was something like ""the sapling at the HIGHEST X and Z coordinate"" (or lowest) is the tree you need to apply to in order to accelerate the growth.  Any other tree doesn't help it grow.  Watching this, it was the ""right"" (direction, not correctness) sapling when they grew.  This is decades old information but it stuck with me.  Little details stick with me."
0,"30:38 use the pig üê∑ as a checkpoint/ safety net or something by putting a saddle on it‚Äôs back so that the hermits have to time the right click, just a idea üí°. Hope it helps:)"
0,"whats your favourite indie game etho? any suggestions, new or old?"
0,üíôüíôüíô
0,would you mind makeing a tutorial to the ultra fast kelp farm
0,"Etho... We just want you to upload. Don't think so hard lol. Seriously man, I've been watching you for like 15 dang years."
0,You should add a hidden pop up shop at the very top with prices that are half the cost of the ones at the bottom
0,"Can you make a roomba by having an armor stand with a helmet going around in front of the hopper minecart by the tree farm? 

Not sure if it would fit the place, just a theoretical question."
0,Etho you got your prebuilt from Costco didn‚Äôt you? Lol
0,"Some mischievous things to do around the Hermitcraft server,
put glass panes at flying height in most of the beacons, (esp. the spawn ones)
put a few tastes of scaffolding around Bdubs builds
put some giant eyebrows rocklee style on Scars zoo entrance (the one already pranked with eyeballs)
send a letter addressed to each hermit delivered to the wrong hermit (thinking some quick lore drop or positive/constructive comment on their latest video, so the hermit who receives it will want to forward it or see the reference, viewers will watch like a hawk filling out a spreadsheet)"
0,"Lat thing, I just heard was Etho turned down ""Corner  Gas""' even though a child of  an actor loves Etho, still does."
0,Has anyone done a tutorial for Etho's new zero tick kelp farm? I'm not quite proficient enough to be successful off just his explanation here and I'm not finding one in search results almost 3 weeks after the video came out. I have never done zero tick before and I'm curious to try it.
0,"not gonna lie i was just exploring the season 9 map and fell into the tree farm hole wondering what it was, thought i was getting pranked till i saw this LOL"
0,"Hey Etho, any plan on the fishing rod arena for the fight club that Pearl invited you to? Wondering if you forgot since it has been a while."
0,I am not a fan of win11 at all.  I recommend linux mint.  Most games are seamless these days.
0,"22:30 I know it's been a week, but it's surprising that Etho doesn't know that only a specific corner of 4x4 trees grow quickly."
0,Your the only one I watch from HC anymore an only the let's play series i think they did iskall dirty an ppl may disagree but I dont üò¢
0,They can make it a countinues steam of white noise or it can be an a single tick at random times. 11:43
2,I seriously want to watch the building process of these types of things from scratch!! 1:52
0,GPU prices so bad they even have Etho down.
0,So $1600 car is like $600 usd right? Just kidding but I do feel bad when Canadians talk about their dollars and I look up the conversion
0,Just came to say you inspired my creative mind and joy for this game when I was younger and growing up
0,Pierre-fond!? Lac des deux montagnes!?
0,"I think the tree bone making has to do with your distance to the saplings. The game won‚Äôt spawn it if it‚Äôs too close, it needs the right amount of space, but if the player blocks it, it won‚Äôt grow."
0,DeckedOut 2 was just last season? Man i feel old
1,Hope you're enjoying the new computer! Glad you got yourself an upgrade ‚ù§
0,"The ""what-if questions"" thing absolutely gets me too. Only I never even make it out of the mental design phase before I trip over about six of them. :D

I really like the game idea, and it was nice to see a blast from the past in the form of that tree farm. I still think it's a really impressive build, and I've started watching quite a few dedicated builders since.

That window into farm design was really cool. Even that just hinted at the really cool stuff you know about redstone, and to me starts to edge into the highly technical stuff like CubicMetre's orbital TNT cannons. I really would like to hear more about how these work and the actual game mechanics that power them (needing to break the kelp in three places was actually something I guessed the cause for, but the zero-tick stuff is mysterious). It's sad that we as a community have gotten a rep of yelling ""XYZ invented it first"" (and on the other hand the occasional plagiarist) where we no longer get these design videos."
0,The Rock Bottom game reminds me of those Dropper maps so much
0,Why wouldn't you just upgrade the computer you have???? You just straight up bought a whole new one? I thought you were Canadian not a wasteful American...
0,"I know I‚Äôm late on this, but at 22:30 I‚Äôm *pretty* sure there is one sapling the game dedicates as the ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù one, so only one of the saplings is able to be bonemealed to consistently grow"
0,"Looking forward to seeing the new game, love your games"
0,"Etho, id love to see your perspective from the 3D among us! Seems you didnt get imposter too too much, but still ; i love watching among us and from your perspective would be awesome."
0,Sounds like a cool idea!
0,"Etho, how will you organize the new items added to the game to your shulker storage?"
2,"27:37 *@EthosLab*
For your rock store, it needs to be located in some kind of ravine or similar, so you REALLY can call it ""Rock BOTTOM"" (preferably IN OR under The Bedrock) :D
30:08 Hay bales."
0,Not sure if anyones asked you this but have you tried Vintage Story playing it gives me nostalgia from you're Terra Firma mod pack you did a while back it feels like something you would enjoy Etho!
0,"Hi Etho, just wondering if you've considered doing another modded series again, because we love them, well, I do anyway. Also what's with the house in creative? it looks gorgeous from what I could see of it. Why haven't you built it on HermitCraft. If you did sorry I missed it"
0,anyone else think Rock E's Bottom would be better for your shop name
0,"Hey Etho! I‚Äôm a graphic designer and a big fan of your work. I‚Äôd love to offer you some free custom thumbnails that could boost engagement on your vids. Happy to show samples if you‚Äôre interested‚Äîno pressure at all!

‚Äî Emmanuel"
2,"Hey Etho, I was messing around with your Endless Storage room idea, and I found an optimization. Instead of the hopper clock thing you made below the rails, all you have to do is comparator test the cart for when it's full. If it's full, send it up the elevator. It's that simple! It's like how you want to keep the buffer hoppers full of items before placing the shulker. Before the transfer of items to the buffer hoppers, you want the cart to be full. I posted this comment in Chaos to Order too but wasn't sure if you would read it, so I posted it here too."
0,"I don't buy new computers. I just buy better components to my existing computer. Currently the only original parts in my computer are case, power supply and the optical drive that I don't have any use for. The last upgrade was just a couple weeks ago when I doubled my ram from 16 to 32 gigabytes by filling the rest of my ram slots because I currently play a minecraft modpack that leaks memory so I want to give it 10 gigabytes so I don]'t have to restart it every half an hour and 16 gigs total wasn't enough for that."
0,üíóüíúüíó
0,What if you played ark again?
0,"Honestly etho, you could upload more of the building and day to day server life, I don't think I'm the only one that absolutely loves it when I see and etho video, don't think I've ever started an episode and not finished it. It's you we look forward to watching, the content of the video will always be good if you're recording, talking and being you! #moreetho"
0,Sooo it's a dropper game?
1,idk what to say the fact that etho was gaming on a 2060 or that fact he over paid for a 4060 build
1,"Now two more months and we will get another episode. If a hernitcraft season lasts two years, that would be like 12 etho episodes!"
0,"I was expecting someone to have an explanation about the tree growing in the comments, disappointed lol"
0,YIPPEE ETHO VIDEO
0,36:50 If I want a movie I‚Äôll watch a movie -Ethoslab 2025
0,"I mean a HC video per 2 months and a LP video per 2 months yeah I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre lacking a little bit, (don‚Äôt worry etho we understand that life has been kicking you in the butt recently and that‚Äôs 100% okay.) but I am agreeing with you on your statement."
0,ima new sub i love your voice man so soothiung
0,the ceiling of that secret base could not be more joel
0,"Wait, does this mean you are going to employ a new tissue box for sound??? üòÆ"
0,"Etho, I like your shows. I have a question about the rocket shop. How is it going?"
0,"Etho, what‚Äôs your frog‚Äôs name?"
0,30:27 the very first contestant for the new game!
0,great ep <3
0,"I think the permits were a great idea, the problem kind of started with banning pop up shops. Most hermits end up building bigger eventually anyway"
0,start a create mod series
0,"We need to petition either an ability to turn the dropper/dispenser noise off, or just delete it altogether"
0,"I long for the day where we see more content like Project Ozone 2, I've watched the series twice now and I'm just starting my 3rd watch. Is there any chance we will see another FTB pack playthrough? I'd love to see you tackle something more modern."
0,"I love how etho seemlessly missed the entirety of the server wide story event. Exactly the same as last season,üòÇ"
0,The way this feels alive is something only Bdubs and Hoodking usually pull off.
0,It's real easy you just turn off all start up applications in task manager and then reboot then find any other hidden startup programs including browser that aren't essential for start up. Sacrifice isn't a term for computers I guess some people really love going super slow watching everything at 100X speed.....
0,37:30 Etho casually dropping a window pun and pretending like it didn't happen.
0,"Have any of the Hermits tried Iskalls Mission Possible Tasks since his removal from the franchise..... It can, I guess you should quarantine his and Stresses builds..... Maybe find a hidden quest along the way......"
0,I think the 2x2 sapling bonemealing is also dependant on which corner you bonemeal (world direction) - I believe for some directions the saplings count as an obstacle for some reason?
0,"many have mentioned the sapling bug but I don't remember seeing the issue number posted, so here it is MC-8187"
0,"‚Ä¶wait, why does my current computer sound eriely similar to ethos? 14th gen intel, 4060, 32 gigs of ram‚Ä¶."
1,"I thought comments would flood asking what's your pc components are, but you instantly fulfilled the curiosity, not being afraid of roasting about the choice and prices. I personally very much appreciate it xD"
0,33:52 I'm shooketh. Congrats new PC üòÇüôå
0,"Wow! You do all this video editing and rendering and you were still only working with 16 GB of RAM? Dang dude. Get yourself to 64, skip right past 32 at this point, lol."
0,The  awkward hermit challenge find....... yeeeeeeaaaaaa. Iskall85 rises from the dead
0,‚ù§
0,"Etho I‚Äôm sad to say windows 11 is terrible, I wish I could go back"
0,"2000 Canadians for a computer sounds a little bit expensive, Etho."
0,heck yeah!! indie gamer Etho!!
0,Oof yikes. Uhm etho I have windows 10 and I don‚Äôt upgrade it to windows 11 because it apparently has a lot of problems for gamers and games not sure exactly what kind of games.
0,"Congrats on your new computer. I always built my self, but that's because i really enjoy the process."
0,"maybe trees cannot be bone-mealed in the night? Just a guess, tho"
0,"Ideas for the game:

Dripstone for death traps
Dispensers that shoot people with levitation arrows/potions (or slow falling) to slow people down"
0,we have the same pc lmao
0,I think etho underestimates how excited we get with his redstone
0,"1 year, 14 episodes ?!"
0,"I have dreams about etho uploads, nothing makes my day like seeing this guy being silly"
0,Start11 rocks for undoing Windows 11's start menu. There's also a registry hack to turn odd the simplified right click menus. Those were my two biggest gripes.
0,"Etho, tomorrow my membership badge is removed as I have hit my own rock bottom and can no longer afford any extras over the bare necessities. 

This isn't meant to be a sad comment but an achievement that I was able to support you from the very beginning you opened up memberships.

I hope others will continue to support you monetarily for a long time to come. I will support by continuing to watch. 

Thanks for sharing your creativity with us."
1,I can't be the only one that saw Etho put in the TNT destroying diamonds lol Etho never changes
0,etho bought an intel cpu in 2025 üíÄ
0,"Love your vids Etho
1440p60 would be nice by the way üëÄ"
0,"Was eyeing your specs every time you pressed F3 üòÇwas wondering when you'll update your computer, you finally did it !! Congrats"
0,I love windows 11. Tabs in terminal and file explorer is 100% the best part
0,Please update your channel description when you get the chance! New specs time :)
0,Does the new computer come with a new tissue box? üòè
0,"13:25 maybe add dark oak or spruce fences in front of the stripped jungle log, so that it runs parallel to the dark oak wood on the right. That way there is a lower contrast making that line less sharp.
Also going off of your Windows 11 mention at the end, would you ever consider Linux? I know a lot of people are switching because of Windows 11 and are having a decent time, especially since Valve's proton can run most windows game fine without a performance hit. On top of that I'm pretty sure your editing and recording software (OBS and davinci resolve) have linux native versions. I'm just curious if you had any thoughts on that.

Personally I'm sitting on Windows 10 until I can't anymore, then I might try 11 but I will also try mint or putting together something in arch or base debian, depending on my energy level lol"
1,"I think for rock bottom it would be pretty fun to have some sort of hail Mary where there's a big drop into a 1x1 of water, but the catch is its so far down or not well-lit that you cant tell if a redstone randomiser has pushed up a pane of blue glass that kills you instantly when you land"
0,"Oh man, that channel description is gonna get updated! Wow!"
0,Make Jimmy a hermit!!!!!
0,"Good to see another episode, glad you treated yourself to a new computer, you deserve it for sure. Also you had the mini game RipZone which was Trident PVP. Keep up the great work!"
0,"ive been using macs all my life and i looveee them, but my sister and i decided to get a windows PC for gaming since thats what everyone recommended. i dont know if it works better but I do miss my mac lol"
0,"5:02 I feel like my builder brain works like this, too. I don't enjoy trying to build an entire base in creative, but I do like to come up with some general ideas that I can bring over to survival."
0,"I love the minigame! It's like ""Go Down"" in Block Wars but with a twist :D"
0,"Oh, he's gonna HATE Windows 11."
0,awww you deserve the new pc etho
0,"If you new to windows 11, there are 2 settings to change. Arrange task bar icons Left. Also download a .reg file that restores classic context menu's. Because right click looks terrible."
0,"Maybe the 2nd tree and further trees might grow quicker because the first tree creates block updates from it's leaves, which refresh saplings and increasing their growth checks."
1,"I've noticed that the 2x2 trees need to grow in a certain order, otherwise you'll just waste bonemeal"
0,Whenever you talk about a moss pit I just think mosh pit. You should just put some armor stands rocking out down there xD

I'll add that I enjoyed the times you played other games, like SOTS: The pit and Cube world. And one of my favorite builds was your tamagatchi wall, as well as making the cave nicer and nicer. Glad you popped up in my head, love ya and keep up the awesome content."
0,12:42 Watch Out for Grian Etho!!
0,The real question is - did he uograde the tissue box along with the computer?
0,An Etho Upload really makes me feel calm ü•∞
0,"Usually don't comment on his videos, but the build was surprisingly reasonable! 4060 is amazing for his needs. Kudos."
0,"16:34 - I love his sword name lol
""I'm washed, You're Quashed"""
0,"if you dislike windows 10 i do NOT recommend windows 11, the annoying parts are worse and the good parts are also worse. your mileage may vary with it but i don't have high hopes for when i eventually must upgrade :("
0,11:52 vanilla tweaks has a texture pack that makes the dispensers and droppers a long with many things a lot quieter!
0,"Etho, as a Canadian, do you watch a lot of hockey?"
0,maybe a minigame where you use the mechanics of that free cam would be cool.
0,Why didn't youtube show this to me? Didnt see it in my recommended or sub box :(

0,You know its bad when etho is talking abour the economy
0,Why is solidarity here?
0,"$1600 CAD for just a 14700k, 32GB DDR5, and 4060 is a scam. Even if $1600 is post tax, $1415+tax for that is still a scam. Techpowerup puts 4060 relative performance increase from the 2060 at about 38% more performance. I salvaged old parts from my old PC, bought a 7700x+32GB DDR5 6000 CL30+B650 combo off Canada Computers for $530+tax. 5070ti for $1199+tax. Reused old PSU, case, SSD. Puts me $1729+tax. Had GTX1080 which is equivalent to 2060 in performance. Got 340% more GPU performance with my upgrade from 1080 to 5070ti."
0,unfortunately windows 11 is definetly worse than windows 10 but i heard windows 10 is gonna get its last ever security update soon so dont really got a choice
0,I like seeing the design process of builds. also enjoy the new pc!
0,"I think you had the perfect formart for season 7 of Hermitcraft. The combination of cute catchy noteblock music and a mini montage of you grinding/farming,building, exploring was very nice. Didn‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúspecial build‚Äù 


Maybe try and return to that format if you are unsure about what projects to show."
0,the rock bottom shop idea is rly awesome!! I can‚Äôt wait to see what it looks like as a final build :0 enjoy your new computer!!!!!
0,"22:17 Etho, i dunno if it's different on a server as I only play solo, but when trying to bonemeal 2x2 saplings, pick the north-west ""corner"" sapling, and it will almost always instantly grow.
GERTZ‚Ñ¢ on the new computer. i have to admit i'm more than a bit jealous. Hope you enjoy it. and looking forward to the next crisp episode. :D"
0,Make a wind charge shop above the rock bottom and call it sky high.
0,new computer!! so can the modded series come back now? xD
0,"Rock bottom is going to feature that cave pig you freed, right?"
0,I can't help but notice that your trees started growing as soon as you targeted one of the inner saplings instead of the outer saplings
0,"I'm looking at a similar jump in computer this year. My current computer is almost identical to your last one. Definitely interested in how the setup goes and especially what you think of Win11, I might just give up and finally commit to linux instead."
0,I like that he used Skizz's empty pyramid space as his planning area
0,"I don't really watch the Hermitcraft series but my withdrawal symptoms from the let's play are getting to me so I'm here. Etho, you are amazing. 30:56 sent me so hard hahahahahah"
0,Changed audio setup? New tissue box!?!?
0,"For me, Etho always seemed like that kind of guy who would build his own PC and have it running on Linux. I still wonder, though, if you're interested in setting it up using Linux."
2,"11:42 Yup, the problem with the sound is it has a very sharp attack and the sound is very frequently played in contraptions that use it at all."
0,do not windows 11.....
0,I physically jumped  the moment I saw that minecart move. I'm really surprised you made it out of there in time.
0,"i think you could add a risk vs reward decision making by adding Piston Walls that pushes the player off in sections of the wall where it looks too smooth.
because i think in those smooth sections the player will see a clear path to where they could drop down but also the risk where they could get pushed off if not timed right."
3,"It is insane that Etho has been running 2060...
He could take a 1time sponsor for some gaming company & get himself a decked out 5090 mega machine.
Etho is a frugal man."
0,You should add a troll water at the bottom with a dripstone inside of it for the rock bottom game
0,36:51 Have you ever played undertale?
0,Does mew computer mean revival of the modded minecraft playthrough?
0,Rock bottom was a local grocery store chainüòÇüòÇ it was also a bar and grill
0,Wasn't that Joel base a part of a mini game that was by the hermit who's name we don't say (we don't say his name right?)
0,"Congrats on the comp, hope the tissue box remains. üíú"
0,Etho is a confirmed Oilers fan! Said Moss Pit way too many times to not be.
0,did i hear that right? new mic? what will happen to the cleanex box?
0,Have you thought about getting linux on your new computer? Or at least dual booting. Minecraft specifically runs flawlessly on linux and support for most games is really good nowadays too.
0,"I thought the video title came in because you hit rock bottom üíÄüò≠, not that you were selling rocks for rock bottom prices"
1,"A new computer, whats next a new keyboard. Crazy"
0,Smart move on the PC specs. Even if you wanted to play AAA games on PC most developers don't even try to optimize their games anymore. Even with a beefy computer you're probably still not going to be able to run them without mods. Might as well buy a console.
1,"That hidden base I think was Joel from the ""mission possible"" quests by Iskal"
0,RIP pig
0,Can we talk about how cool the presentation of the items to negate Fall damage was at  29:55. Like a minecraft powerpoint
0,16:33 lol classic Etho hating bats
0,I hope the tissue box makes it into the new setup!
0,"37:32 With so many people switching to Linux, Pewdiepie as a landmark, I wouldn't be surprised if next episode Etho starts with ""so I installed Linux Mint"""
0,"22:45
I'm playing with the create mod and was making a farm for jungle wood and was noticing the same thing about the trees.
I tried using bonemeal to jumpstart the farm and get more saplings. 
I thought I was doing something wrong."
0,22:45 etho you have already pointed out how certain saplings won‚Äôt work with the bone meal because of the north or east(?) saplings
0,Make a corner with a lapis lazuli block at the bottom so it looks like you can easily fall all the way down.
0,"etho: i don't like not showing parts of the process though out the project and just showing the final product 
also etho at 20:57 :"
0,"""with prebuilds I'm buying peace of mind"" -> get 14th gen intel CPU."
0,I really hope Jimmy joins Hermitcraft next season. But I think he doesn't make enough content to join. But I hope he will join in the future. He is super funny.
0,will the tissuebox stay?
2,"Consider adding shulkers to Rock Bottom, having their projectiles chase you could make for fun gameplay, and it's quite punishing if you get hit when your objective is to go down, not up!"
0,I love the way you explain things. Never fails to make me laugh. Glad you got an upgrade friend.
39,"Etho: I've never done trident PvP before!

Also Etho: has done trident PvP before"
10,Watching etho play with autocrafting tnt minecarts is one of the most beautiful things in nature
0,"Should make a billboard, where it is you advertising Rock Bottom Prices.
Was disappointed you didn't include you seeing Grian's waterfall."
0,Aaaah yeah I should get a new PC and you've reminded me how much I don't want to set up a new windows üôÉI altered 10 in a bunch of ways that I have 0 memory of but I know I'll miss my changes when they are gone! GL with yours!
0,Cool new computer. I recommend the steam version of dwarf fortress if you never played the original.
0,"An RTX 4060 can be a solid choice in the mid range, though a bit expensive for its performance depending on the price you got. But the 14th gen Intel Core (13th also to a certain extent) were prematurely self-deleting. Though the i9s were far worse then i7s, I'm almost certain the 14700 is within the group with issues (the i5s and i3s seemed to be more stable). But I could be wrong.
Granted that the updated microcode should allegedly solve the issues, only not mitigating the already damaged parts of cpus that were more used and suffered degradation.
I don't mean to scare you, if you were outside the loop on the hardware issues, but a warning to check with your builder is a matter of ethics in my book.
I personally have been going full team red in the last 7 years because of the price and performance balance, plus the excessive milking from nVidia and Intel, which pisses me off. But single-threading might give Intel an advantage depending on the price and cpu, so that can be very important in most games. But Ryzen has locked in the multi-threaded performance even in AM4 and seems to be looking fine in AM5. (without automatic driver updates, though, since I had some weirdness with that recently)."
0,"Hey Etho! I like the Rock Bottom game idea.  I wonder if you‚Äôve designed it in a way that more levels can be added later? You could even invite the other hermits to contribute levels if the design is simple enough.  Probably there‚Äôs not space in the shopping district, but a collaborative game could be neat idea for another time. Extend the lifespan etc. cheers"
0,that's a solid pc etho im not 100% sure how much Canadian money is compared to my own but I see it's a good bit below usd and that's a solid price for what you got.
8,"36:05 Etho, 14700 i7 14th gen intel CPU's have known issues with voltage and require microcode updates in your BIOS so be sure to take care of your new intel CPU by checking for any bios updates when you get it! I found out the hard way about my own 13700k i7 13th gen that has the same issues in my new prebuilt computer when it didn't have the microcode updates!

 I will post a source from Intel in the comments, but you should only have to check for BIOS updates for your motherboard when you get your new PC to be fine.

I love your videos! I have watched since the mindcrack days! 

Etho girlies stay winning!!!"
0,"you'll probably hate windows 11 if 10 was starting to become an issue for you. just in my experience though. without getting into politics or privacy, its still a mess. the only thing i found a good resolve for was how to reset the right click menu by editing the registry. if privacy is a big concern for you, absolutely do not install 11. besides windows, i'd only recommend linux, which i'm sure you'd have no problem setting up and i'm sure you're aware of it's limitations. it runs minecraft no problem and i think video editting is as easy but idk. other games may have some problems, however now that steam came out with proton it's a managable reality, but i've never used either. good luck etho!"
0,"I ended up leaning windows for good to looking after how annoying windows 11 got. Valve has done wonders for Linux gaming, so it's been very smooth!"

0,Are you replacing the tissue box with the pc?
0,There's some missing pieces of that Season 9 rebuild specifically at the roof. I'm curious if this is lazy Etho not wanting to do the hanging vine lights or if this was a redesign to help include the new skylights? XD
0,"Hey Etho! OG fan here ;) I remember when you gave shout out to Cpt Sparkles and Coe for the first time, and I had no idea who it was!  üòÇ Speaking of Jordan: maybe it would be a good idea for you to create a second channel, where you could stream and publish VODs? Could be in combination with Twitch streaming? Another good stream of revenue for you and a chance for us, your fans, to see you more often? I.e. your fishing adventure would be nice to follow live ;) Anyways, love your work and it is great to see you posting!"
1,Always love the episodes! Excited for the new computer

I like how all of yall make it easier to hang out with one another. I hope your new computer works out quickly for ya. I found the win11 learning curve not too bad, and it's easy enough to customize what you need it to do"
1,Etho are we ever gonna see you upload more than once a month can you please address this because we all love you and your vids and just wanna see more of you and it‚Äôs so hard to wanna continue watching your series when it‚Äôs almost pointless because it takes so long for vid please upload more or address this love you etho

1,"Hey Etho, just to forewarn you about the newer Intel processors, there is an issue causing the processor to have permanent damage or burnout due to excessive voltage.  I personally experienced it with games such as COD and Warhammer, and really any other graphically intensive games that caused the game to crash.  There is a fix that I had to do which involved changing a few settings in my BIOS.  For reference, I have an i7-13700KF.  For more information, you can google i7 14000 burnout."
0,what are ethos top 5 games???
0,"Love the idea of rock bottom!
Im currently working on a base in a minecraft realm where i live in a 25 wide hole in the ground. Going from Y120 to Y-50.
Im going to build it in layers with them being 20 blocks long.
So every 20 blocks you go up or down you get a different theme! My main goal is to make it fun to go up and down while also keeping things functional.
So far ive got riptide trident things going, but if there is too much water where you can safely land then it isn't as fun(i want my friends to die trying to navigate my base).

This has multiple efects. Base requires minimal horizontal lighting and space(everyone livss close together), base defense(no one really has feather falling yet), the ability to get to any part of the base fast without elytra(they like playing in peaceful so i can't reach the end currently), and most importantly, it is going to be my most complex build creatively.

Can't wait to see how you allow people to go down! Maybe there could also be traps that send you up?

Anyway have a great day!"
0,"In Ravager Rush, there's a repair to make to the froglight purchase area.  Joe used one of the bubble columns as an ender pearl stasis chamber, and Tango moved a lilypad to activate it.  But they both forgot to fix it, and Joel's recent video showed it was still unfixed."

(There is one in Halifax) If you want a full custom PC, you can get all the parts there and for an extra $119.99 they put it all together for you including hardware, software, water cooling, it's a fantastic deal! No more wasted weekends setting up a custom PC. Not sponsored! I don't work there! I just buy from them all the time for new PCs and I've never gone wrong. Keep them in mind in 6 years when you buy another new PC!"

0,"etho i just wanna say im graduating college tomorrow and I still remember the first video I watched of yours. It was your singleplayer lets play and you were in the mancave adding leaves to the roof to cover the lights. Since then I graduated highschool and now, tomorrow it'll be college.

I just want to say thank you so much for all these videos and everything you do."
13,"not sure what's funnier. etho using skizz's pyramid as his superflat creative world, or the fact that the pyramid symbolises mazlows hierarchy of NEEDS. etho test building the farms/builds he needs in the pyramid area is peak irony"

0,"You used my favorite color scheme again, for the tree farm! :) Blue terracotta and warped logs are perfect together. And I appreciate that you're one of the few people I see using the warped logs with their bark on. They have such a cool animation! People should use them more"
0,You could try opening up the water column of the kelp farm to one side. Let the water flow out a block so the kelp evacuates the area faster and doesn't bunch up.
1,"Store could've been named ""Rock Bought'em"""

and 3: i feel like jimmy might take that trophy to misadventures SMP..."
0,I grew up with etho and everytime he uploads i get my snacks and watch :)
0,"22:24 dont know why bonemeal isnt consistent, but regular tree growth is pretty much entirely random i believe, or close enough to random that you cant tell. i remember seeing tango use tree saplings as a randomizer for clank detectors in decked out 2. apparently this works because an observer can detect every time a tree attempts to grow, even if it actually cant, and you can use this to get random redstone signals.

i think you had to build it a certain way to trick the saplings into thinking they can still grow without actually doing so. cant remember exactly, but i think you have to put something 2 blocks above it (or maybe a half slab?) and have a light source nearby."
1,Etho I am sorry to break this to you but you have goofed around in season 10 as well.
0,Loved the interaction with Jimmy and the other Hermits!
5,"Im pretty sure the base is joels, because the lever/end rod/chain design is all over his base"
0,I think it would be awesome to have time-lapse type videos of you working and planning you builds on the side like how you did in this video but more in depth and shows more of the building probably won't happen because of the amount of work put on top of everything else but I think it would awesome!
1,Joel's secret base is from Iskall's mission game.  I'm pretty sure it was one of those missions to build a secret base.
0,The aim of Etho's new game is to hit rock bottom in Rock Bottom at Rock Bottom.
0,The dream of upgrading my computer most of its 12 years old at this point and mine hates my guts couple of parts that I was able to upgrade like hard drive and power supply and I think the video card is a little bit newer but only by like a few years I just haven't had a job that pays enough that I can ever afford anything also you should have really reached out to impulse that's the tech boy right there
0,"27:20 yeah, that's my entire existence lol... peak ADHD and OCD"
0,Could easily build a coal generator looking thing around thst kelp farm which would make sense and look epic
0,The real question is did you upgrade your tissue box to a better tissue box?
0,"Etho, just wanted to say I've been a fan of your stuff for most of my young-adult life. Some of the early Adventure Map series with Guude and Bdubs, the Mindcrack days and of course your Let's Play series have brought me so much joy throughout my life. The mix of playfulness paired with an actual mastery of the technical craftiness of this game is why I always come back to your videos. Keep doing your thing, many best wishes."
0,"Etho i love you , i grew up watching you , but lately i feel like we get 1 episode per month"
1,That's a nice computer upgrade!
0,"Where‚Äôs a tutorial for his tree farm? I‚Äôd love to have one in my world, I use his floor storage system in my world!"
0,"massive props to Etho, he could've easily reached out to a prebuilt place and got the PC for free for a sponsorship. The fact that he didn't in today's world is shocking and speaks to the man character."
0,"For Rock Bottom, I wonder if a bucket of milk would work as a 1 time use water bucket clutch? I've never tried it, but it could be an interesting option that won't risk messing up the rest of the build by leaving water sources around."
8,"Etho, the tree bug happens because 2x2 trees dont like blocks next to them when they grow. The only exception is logs and leaves. (Even vines from jungle tress prevent growth). Importantly, other saplings also prevent tree growth. The exact dimensions of the sapling ""exclusion zone"" is a 3x3 square around the Northwest sapling. So once the northwest-most tree grows, suddenly all the trees to the southeast can now grow because the saplings that were preventing the growth are now replaced by logs and therefore are no longer preventing growth. Similarly, 2x2 trees that are planted in a line will grow in a similar manner: the north-most or the west-most tree will grow first, and then the trees will progress down the line. 

source: extensive Redstone tree farming and research. 

Mangrove trees grow in an even more interesting manner..."

0,Is etho using a texture pack?
0,"Etho, we love you, but there's an easy way to say it: You were fishing. (Which makes the kelp farm rather ironic if you think about it.)"
0,"You should make Rock Bottom themed as an aquatic hadal-zone habitat, like Rock Bottom from _SpongeBob._"
0,friendly reminder to update the computer specs in your channel's description once you set up the new computer
0,"For spruce saplings, you would want to place 4 and bonemeal 1 of them only. If you have 16 in a close area, the game tries to figure out which one you are trying to grow it might be a bug. But if you place 4 at a time it would save you a bunch of bonemeal."
0,You can also try out using Linux instead of Windows 11.
2,"Hey Etho big warning/tip for windows 11, i just got my first decent gaming rig and was stuck in a setup loop due to a known issue intalling the latest update of windows 11 and had to skip the update from a command window to even use my PC. So for sure do some research to see if that issues still going on. You seem like a techy guy so i doubt youll have much issue. Its wild to hear youve been running such an average setup for so long!

Bought an M.2 drive soon after and it was the absolute cherry on top of the upgrade cake, our modded ARK: Survival Evolved server often required me to spend 12-ish minutes to load and now I can get on in less than 2. Still sitting on Windows 10 and really dreading the update to Win11, had to help a few ppl with various things on that OS and it was a really painful experience, many features are hidden in just straight up dumb places."

0,"hi etho, the bonebeal bug on your tree farm is something i‚Äôve experienced too. i find that if you try and change which sapling you‚Äôre trying to bonemeal every so often, it makes it easier for the tree to realise that it‚Äôs ready to grow. i think there is actually a specific sapling that you can bonemeal and it will just grow like normal, i think it might be influenced by directionality or something.

i‚Äôd love to know what indie games you‚Äôre playing! i‚Äôve been super addicted to balatro recently."

0,"Etho, if you're bothered by Windows, perhaps consider keeping your old computer so you can experiment with Linux distros without interrupting your workflow on your main computer? I won't tell you there isn't going to be a learning curve with using a different OS and finding FOSS software alternatives for your daily activities, hence I suggest to experiment first. But Minecraft java runs great on Linux, and between Steam and Lutris most games in general are working pretty good these days. Took me a while to figure it all out, but I haven't had any reasons to go back to Windows since I finally migrated. Feels good to not worry about my own operating system spying on me, or updating whenever it pleases."

0,"18:00 You know you can have the crafter dispenser the TBR minecarts directly onto the rails instead of the dispenser.... then have a comparator reading the crafter's fullness level to turn off the RS torch powering the rails. 

For anyone who needs further explanation: 

Crafters can dispense minecarts onto rails (noted above), then the comparator reading the comparator, contrasting against something completely full (lectern with a book turned to it's last page / another crafter with all slots blacked out, etc) when there's anything in the crafter (so it's 100% full) it outputs a signal to turn off the redstone torch (have the comparator pointing into the block this torch is on, directly or via rs dust). Once the crafter runs out of whatever material it's given (tnt and a minecart) the comparator turns off turning the torch back on."

I recently got myself a new pc aswell and wanted to get a really decent one just so i dont have to worry for the next couple years.
I'm the same when it comes to prebuild but i like choosing my own components.
So i build a custom PC on a PC building website thats local to my country and got a setup thats lets me play any game i own on high settings with well over 100FPS for 2,6k Euros.
Still expensive but i got a 4070 TI Super, 32GB DDR5 and a 12 core AMD CPU aswell as the fasted commercial SSDs and M.2s i could get.


Since i work in IT i can also deduct it from taxes which helps alot and i think you can probably do that aswell.
Have an awesome week!"

0,"The tree issue is caused by a weird behavior with the 2x2 spruce saplings. The logic for detecting if they are blocked is really strict so almost any block adjacent to them is enough to block growth, even torches, tall grass, or other spruce saplings, but only in certain directions. So some of the trees are blocked by the other saplings and will never grow, but once the one unblocked tree grows, the ones it was blocking can grow freely since logs and leaves do not block growth. If you pay attention you'll notice that one tree always grows first and as long as you bonemeal them in order you shouldn't have any issues."

0,"The 2x2 tree-growing bug may not be a bug I think. I believe it is directional. The 4 tree formation that you use, has the trees adjacent/touching each other. When I used to play Minecraft, I used the same formation to grow trees compactly as well. I noticed, there's always 2 trees that grows with ease and 2 that never grows until the adjacent growable one grew. 

My bet is, when you bonemeal a sapling, it scans adjacent 3x3 blocks to determine the 2x2 sapling group it is in. And based on the direction(north/east/whichever it starts scanning from), it may find a sapling that is intended to be part of another tree. But when it checks for 2x2 formation encompassing both the original and the newly found sapling, it finds incomplete formation thus the tree growing fails.

Another possibility is touching blocks preventing mega-tree growing. I remember grass stops growing, same tree sapling prevents growth from 2 directions but not the other two. Logs never prevents, thus when the growable ones grow, the other 2 can also grow.

I don't have Minecraft on my new PC, I can't test/experiment. The insight is from memory."

8,"Etho is hermitcraft at its purest <3 his voice is like a breath of fresh air. He has *such* a calming presence. He seems like such a sweet person, his outros, everything. That ‚ÄúTake care everyone‚Äù seems so genuine <3"
1,I love how you make different kinds of bombs. You've developed so many methods of clearing land. I can't wait to see how else Etho will continue to blow up Minecraft blocks
0,I thought his shop would be a giant stone butt...
0,I MISSED YOU ETHO!!‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you are doing amazing!
0,"The amount of times Etho has called himself or something he‚Äôs made stupid in the first 10 minutes of this episode: too many times xD

We love Etho, hes so humble"
0,hay etho are you planing to play terraria 1.4.5 when it comes out or even terraria clamity mod?
0,"Etho: I never done trident pvp

Also etho: made trident pvp before"
0,36:16 finally he's moving one to Dance Dance Revolution 5
3,etho upgrading his computer before his keyboard is just etho lore lol
0,Fully agreed on the bit about pre built PCs. It's just so much less headache (especially the software setup). It also used to be far more not worth the price to buy pre builts but now there is a lot of competition in that market so you really aren't spending THAT much more for a pre built these days.
0,Etho! you are the best
0,"I recently upgraded my amd RX580 to a 6800XT, and went from a 1080p monitor to 4K. It is amazing, and i love hearing when people upgrade because the difference is so significant. I hope it works well for you! I am keeping my eye out for tools to declutter Window 11. Its not awful, but there's definitely a lot of bloat."
5,"Guys, it's been so long since Etho posted hermitcraft. I've had to search other hermits videos just to find out what he is up to. Then I found hermitcraft recap and it made things a lot easier. But still, my Etho fix is hard to satiate. Glad we are finally getting another episode."
0,I'm a little surprised Etho doesn't build his own or at least upgrade his own PC. I built my pc back in 2010 or something and only upgraded it since then never replaced the whole thing it's the ship of thesis that started out with a phenom ii x4 980 CPU went to i5 6600k now rocks i5 12600k etc. Guess he's just not a real computer enthusiast just a Minecrafter.
1,An average of 1 episode a month after a year is not what I was hoping for after being spoiled from last season
31,"For rock bottom, you could do something like pressing a hidden button that after a delay causes a dispenser to create a water source for a brief moment, so they have to find the button, then notice the water to see what it does, and then time it correctly to use the shortcut."
0,"Ethoooooo...

When are you going to do Vintage Story?"
1,I'm shocked that Etho's old computer was _only_ 4 years old considering the stories of his other equipment lol
1,"Etho working on 16 GB of RAM into 2025... Honestly, massive respect"
56,37:32 don't worry Windows 11 is worse then 10... üòì
1,"Hey Etho, I found it super interesting seeing how you experiment and change ideas from creative to survival for HC. Would you ever consider touring your HC creative world(s?) for a season after it is over?"
1,What about linux for the new pc? I feel like etho may be a (potential) linux enjoyer?
0,"2x2 trees need 'clear' blocks of space to their north and their west to grow.  Saplings don't count as clear space but logs do, which is why the other trees can only grow once the northwest tree has grown.  It's weird."
0,"Omg, this comments.... Is ""get a life"" to much?"
0,I'm so sorry Etho but entering the new tree farm room just makes it look like a purple minion
1,This thumbnail threw me. I thought YT was throwing an old video at me and had to read the title 3 times to be sure.
4,Just a warning about that wind charge shop - you're supplying the others with the equipment needed to flip all your trapdoors.
1,personally i love watching the redstone builds from the ground up. It would be sweet to see more of those as stand alone videos since it seems like some people have an aversion to it.
0,I wonder if Etho also got a new mic stand with that new PC
0,jimmy saying score sounds like a redneck saying skull thank you
0,The tree thing is because you are randomly ageing the saplings. You probably need to spread out the bonemeal a bit on all 4 saplings in the megatree
0,Nice video etho
0,"My very _very_ first Minecraft build in my first Minecraft world (back in early 2013) was an attempt at an underground tree farm that could grow large spruce and jungle trees, inspired by the LP world tree farm. I got impatient digging the holes (in creative mode too lol) so they just ended up being deep pits that opened to the sky with no decoration and some tunnels to connect. But still... kinda funny to see all these years later an actual underground tree farm for tall trees from the man himself."
0,The GOAT!
0,ETHO!!!
561,"I'm calling it, Etho figuring out the TNT minecart trap issue is going to be like, a Chekov's gun in some upcoming Life series."
0,Omg your computer story is almost exactly what I did to a T a couple months ago haha. Except that I still did go for building my own and took some pre-owned deals to get the price down.
0,I think Etho is the only man ever to use smooth stone and _froglights_ as building blocks for doing redstone
0,"I stick to the $1800-2200 CAD range for my computers, built my current one in 2014/15 and it has 32GB of RAM (DDR3). Mine hasn't been able to run new AAA games for about 2-3 years now, but I target an 8-year extended lifespan for a high-end machine. (Or four years for an optimal lifespan, sounds like that's what you're on.) One day I'll upgrade, but I haven't seen any AAA games to be excited for yet. I know Creeper World IXE was pushing the CPU's limits though, so an upgrade is in the pipeline. But I'm still hitting the min spec for Windward Horizon though, so maybe later this year or next."
0,here we are
0,"only etho would upload a video on hermitcraft on the latest version and not show off a SINGLE thing about it, as if Everybody watches his let's play (which they should) so he doesn't even need to mention it"
0,This is another episode where Etho is being super based and I dig it.
0,Speed dropper?
0,"Does anyone else like, instinctively grab snacks while watching an Etho video?"
3,29:50 fantastic! using the pouches in a demonstration like this is why youre the goat
0,"Cub: drops the word fanboy
Etho: hardcut ""Alright everybody we're going to move on to the next segment now"""
0,YEY
1,"I still love the colors of that tree farm build :D 

btw can't wait for the secret fight club arena... :x
tripleA game player here ;_; ...

Yay for new pc! New keyboard too? =p"
0,"I agree with you on AAA games, indie games are where the real gems are at"
0,"Congrats on your new PC! please let us know how it runs, im looking to upgrade my self and I was looking for exactly that Spec, I hope everything runs grate."
1,Don't worry too much Etho! You have now made more episodes this season than last season when you exclude decked out! Good progress.
0,always maintain that questioning attitude!!
0,"Hey etho, (ergo?) I know slither channels doing somthing similar, you mention not knowing if we would like builds, would it be possible to get an ethos extras channel or somthing? Where you record your building process! Wouldn‚Äôt even have to have commentary I would definitely watch you just figure out a build on a 2 hr video either some light music on the background!"
0,Etho u should try streaming again I think you would like it!
0,Some of the best games I've played were not AAA games or have the fanciest graphics. They just had great game play and little to no story.
0,Haven‚Äôt finished the episode but u could put a light inside the kelp area to see through the window more clearly
0,"Sounds like we might have got the same prebuilt, Etho. Mine runs like a top."
0,Would love to see you do a create mod let's play
0,Accomplish the mission brother. #CAN<3USA
0,That kelp farm is amazing!
0,Using Skizz‚Äôs pyramid foundation as a ‚Äúsuper flat‚Äù is awesome haha
407,"16:24 Joel built the base as one of the Mission Possible challenges. 

Something along the lines of ""Build a secret base in another hermit's base. It must include a bed, a crafting table and a plant"""
0,"Just as a joke, you should put the sign with the actual price down at bedrock, then charge an obscene amount.  That way, technically, you have ""rock bottom prices""."
0,"It seems to me like Etho and Zed are on a similar but very different mindset this season. Zed is wanting to gamify the entire survival aspect of Hermitcraft (farm building/resource collection). Meanwhile, Etho is wanting to gamify the whole co-op aspect of Hermitcraft (shopping district/exchange)."
0,"Really glad you got the 40 series and not 50s.  For your use case, the 50s would add nothing.  Good for dlss, etc.

Do you like Starcraft?  I played the first when it came out on the floor in my sisters room and I was like 3 or 4"
0,Was this some sort of super pig? 31:09
0,I‚Äôd never expect you to be a prebuilt guy! Grats on the new pc though!
3,19:25 Etho... you placed the powered rails on top of the crafter the observer was powering... allowing the observer to power the rails as soon as the machine started.
0,5:40 Pink Floyd reference?
0,YAY IM HAPPY NOW I NEEDED THIS SO BADLY ‚ù§
0,i have a better pc than etho and i dont even play games for a living i must be doing something wrong
0,Is that the Kelp Farm that Grian broke? Wow that's a long time ago...
4,"Being distracted by 'What if?' Is a good distraction.  You never know what new exciting things you can come up with. üòä
Rock Bottom...Awesome!!!"
0,great video!
0,"Would be really cool if in Rock Bottom you could get upgrades along the path down. A few seconds of slow falling, feather falling boots with only a few durability, an item of food. Might be too complicated but could add extra risk vs reward for extra jumps on the way down!"
0,"I just wanna say, I love Etho"
0,So... A dropper map?
268,"I was having a rough day till I saw there was an Etho video! I got my snacks!

Since I've started watching Etho, I have:

Finished middle school.
Finished high school.
Bought my first car.
Got married.
Started a business.
Sold my first car.
Got divorced.
Shuffled through random entry level jobs.
Closed my business.
Landed a robotics job because I wrote scripts to cheat at Minecraft.
Met the girl of my dreams.
Learned Spanish.
Got engaged.

I'm on my way to be a systems engineer..

And now I'm here, watching this Etho video. Weird."
0,"I personally enjoy seeing the redstone side of things to understand what's going on, especially as someone who really loves redstone. But I think it may drag out for some people that don't care too too much, so maybe a mix is good? You've actually done that a lot and I think that was a good way to do it, that you explain the basic idea behind it and build a fraction of it (e.g. just 1 part if that part needs to be repeated), then you finish it and then you show off what things got added to use it, like a dropoff area or so."
0,I don't think there is any content you can make that people won't watch
0,So‚Ä¶ What indie games have you been playing Etho?
0,"Etho, maybe line the tunnel to your tree farm with wood? I think the colour combo would be superb!"
0,babe wake up etho posted a video
0,Better have a SpongeBob reference in rock bottom
0,I use to watch ethos everyday after school from 2011-2015; now 25 and I still watch ethos after work :) Love ya vids! Always a good day when etho uploads
0,Etho building 0-tick farms was not on my bingo card for this year
2,"‚ÄúSo I thought, ‚Äòalready using zero-ticking, might as well make it as fast as I can.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ and i‚Äôm over here, like, ‚Äúyup, another couple hours on a new farm.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ Loved the look into the process, nuts-and-bolts stuff can be boring but this was a lot of fun! (& That Bonemeal Tree bug!!!!!????? Thank you for mentioning it)"
2,"wake up babe, new etho vid dropped."
0,"So happy that you finally gave yourself a computer upgrade! I was wondering if your YouTube bio was out of date, but every time you hit F3 I knew it was still accurate. I HIGHLY recommend buying an SSD for editing if your new computer does not already have a decent size one. The amount of editing you have done on that single hard drive for years baffles me! Great video and good luck!"
0,I still remember you talking about getting a new computer from Future Shop. Always happy to hear about your infrequent and modest upgrades.
0,"For one of the drop challenges, make it so that if the player clutches by pressing a button on the way down it will dispense water for 4 ticks.
Another idea would be allowing them to catch themselves in (enter) a boat / minecart mid fall to prevent fall damage."
0,"Thank you to be with us, you are amazing"
0,Its so reassuring that Etho also bought a new beastly computer before the tariffs. I went from an i5-something and a 2070 to an AMD 7800x3D and 5070 last week.
5,No format is best format. Loved the episode! It was great getting to see Etho‚Äôs ‚Äúsketchbook‚Äù creative world. Great stuff.
0,"I'm glad you decided to bring back the whole tree farm build from season 9! it's one of my favourites of yours, and i do agree that we didn't have enough time to appreciate it :D"
0,36:20 yeah... but do you still have your computer set up on a bookshelf with a microphane held together with sticky tape and a mouse in front of the keyboard instead of beside it...? üòÅ
0,14:45 that might be one of cub's secret bases? he put a bunch around the server back in the day
0,Yay we found Joel‚Äôs room!! üéâ
0,Great video
2,An Etho video on my birthday! What a treat! Xx
0,"Terrafirmacraft is still around, it is a bit more advanced than on your last playthrough, I'd love to see you play it again, or alternatively Vintage Story which basically is terrafirmacraft as a standalone game, ive just started playing and i really enjoy surviving in it and how it's restrictiveness influences play style"
0,Congratulations on your new computer!
1,Perhaps update your computer specs in your YouTube about page üëÄ
0,But did you keep the tissue box?
2,Thanks for another wonderful video Etho!  (also the Jimmy death notification montage @ 31:06 üòÇ)
5,Guys will be like ‚ÄúI needed this‚Äù and it‚Äôs just an Etho video.
0,"So thrilled to see the season 9 decor making a return for the tree farm!! I loved those colors and patterns so much, and they fit well with your current base too in my opinion :D
Edit: and wow the skylights look so sci-fi and cool!"
0,Even though i know nothing about redstone or traps i do recall hearing about that minecart direction bug long time ago
0,"thought with the time bombs:
hoppers running into the crafters, carrying more iron and TNT, in order to make ones that have a longer ""fuse"" and bigger explosions"
0,yay etho uploaf üéâ
0,"If you got a new computer with some fancy upgrades, does that mean the modded series/a different modded series may make a return üëÄ"
2,13:48 Grian proofing
0,Those stop lights are so cool. It‚Äôs too bad they didn‚Äôt make it in.
0,"11:25 If anything, exploring the what-if questions in the videos might be interesting as well (even if it‚Äôs just shorter, less-edited videos on the side separate from the main uploads)"
2,"I like how you showed us your planning process in the creative worlds, it was neat to see some of what goes on behind the scenes. Also that copper harvester machine was cool, I think adding machines like that to your base would give it a lot more character, even if the machines aren't super practical"
0,üòäüòä
0,"Hello Etho, big fan. I know this comment is presumptuous, but since you talked about your computer upgrade and you ended up going with an intel 14th generation chip, I hope you are aware of the potential issue plaguing that particular generation as well as the 13th. Supposedly those issues have been addressed in a microcode update, but if your new computer starts having issues, that would be the first place to check."
0,you are amazing
0,"I feel like Etho has at least 50 episodes worth of unreleased footage because every hermitcraft video from other videos, or like streaming from scar or whoever, etho is just in the chat talking trash. Etho just.. plays minecraft and hangs out on hermitcraft and when the content comes it comes"
0,"If you're upset with Windows 10, I doubt Windows 11 will be much better. I recently switched to Linux Mint and its been very similar to what I expect from Windows. Yes there's a few oddities, but Minecraft and Steam games run perfectly fine. Most of the issues I've run into were fixable within an hour or so, and were for games that insisted upon using their own launchers, like Blizzard, Ubisoft, or Epic games.

I don't know anything about recording software though."
0,ooohhhh Etho.... I think Impulse has a similar game almost finished already....
0,"New PC, cool. The real question is, did you get a new tissue box?"
0,Audio changes? Mans went to Costco and got a new microphone box. Maybe this time it‚Äôs a hot dog box.
0,"I know you said 4 to 5, but all I heard was bdubs saying ""45 yrs sense you bought a new computer"""
0,"Oh man etho I recently got into Don‚Äôt Starve Together with one of my buddies because it went on sale and I‚Äôm having so much fun, I‚Äôve been wanting to play it since I saw you play it with team Canada some eightish years ago and I would recommend giving it another shot, there is so much content to that game that I don‚Äôt think you saw and there is a bunch added since then aswell,and  love the video as always!"
0,Please reconsider your pc choice. If you look around you can find better systems at around the same price. The 4060 won't take you much further in Da Vinci Resolve because it only has 8 GB of video memory compared to your 2060's 6GB. Grab at least a 4060 Ti 16GB or 4070 12GB for ~1700 CAD - On Newegg there is a 14400F/RTX 4070/32GB RAM/1TB SSD ABS (Newegg brand) pc right now.
0,i thought we‚Äôd never be back
0,"I was in the ""I need a new computer boat"" as well, except my last one was 10 years old. What I got is about the same as your new setup, but I had to do a lot of fiddling to get the fans to stop roaring."
0,With each new edition of windows it feels like they add another layer of grease
0,15:41 I completely forgot about joel‚Äôs secret hideout omg
0,"started watching ethos hermitcraft 2 days ago, AND NOW THERES ANOTHER TO WATCH TODAY WOOHOO"
0,Me when I reroll the secret room
0,"In this episode, Etho explains why his videos take a long time to produce.

It's worth it."
3,"Etho: ""Hopefully Windows 11 isn't a big pain.""
Me: Join the Linux side! You know you'll love the customization."
0,EEETHHOOOOOO
0,"Windows 11 is a complete nightmare that is only going to get worse, dump that crap and switch to Linux!"
0,please tell me etho replaced his monitor and keyboard as well..
0,"etho, are you still using a 1080p monitor?"
0,etho if you had gone AMD the X3D chips are super good for minecraft they increase the minimum FPS alot and make it so much smoother a 4060ti for that much  is so much goddam I'm sorry you couldnt get a better price
0,"Welcome back, my friend!
Congratulations on the new computer."
0,I think you're gonna long for windows 10 once you try 11...
0,"1:50 thinks we wouldn‚Äôt enjoy seeing the whole thing, everyone who subscribe to Etho for that exact fact : hmmmm"
0,Are you gonna do the outside of ravenger rush? I'm sure pearl(or a number of other hermits) would take care of if if you asked...
0,Casually dropping cursed 0 tick redstone knowledge. Classic etho
0,"arial tnt mining has a slight, relaxing vibe to it"
0,Neat Etho üíú
0,"""brand new computer""... Do you have a mousepad yet?"
55,"Big LP vibes from this episode, thanks for mixing some bits of info about the server in this one too, I really appreciate it. The small timelapses are better than abrupt cuts, although at this point I feel like the latter fits more your style of videos.

Etho's old and new computer, for anyone wondering:

i7 9700          -> Intel i7 14700
16 GB DDR4 -> 32 GB DDR5 (idk how fast, probably 5600 MT/s)
RTX 2060      -> RTX 4060
Windows 10 -> Windows 11

Thought for sure that you would go full AMD this time, considering how compelling Ryzen CPUs and, more recently, the RX 9070 XT have been, compared to Intel and Nvidia's stuff. Well, staying with what works best for you is probably the safest way to go. Just make sure to keep an eye on that CPU because 13th and 14th gen Intel CPUs had issues with both oxidation and the microcode literally frying them, and also because they chug a lot of power (and therefore, need good cooling installed).

Will we get to see a picture of it? lol"
0,"Hahahaha, Etho play games to shoot the bastards, not to pillow them because of some childhood trauma plot."
0,"I just finished my AP Exam, this is such a reward"

0,10:14 what my grandpa called me after we left the woods and he is the only ones with ticks
1853,Etho's entire season 10 is just him building games next to Tango to give Tango the urge to build the next Decked Out.
0,"Unfortunately, windows 11 is quite awful"

0,"I think the tree growing problem has to do with which sapling gets the bonemeal in the 2x2. I think the game kind of ignores some of the saplings, or can't calculate the correct patch of 2x2 for some reason."
0,"Hi Etho, I really enjoyed this episode! Hope you're doing well. I'd be interested in seeing more of the ideas you cut from the episode if you have any examples of builds or creative experiments that didn't make it. I know you've said in the past that some of your noteblock stuff you can't show but I really enjoy listening to the little jingles you make and how you approach it too! Thank you for the episode and take care! ‚ù§"
0,Etho! What if we wanted to see your what if creative process! Nothing wrong with a random creative only test video every once in a while
0,"22:40 I have noticed that trees dont grow if you bonemeal one face constantly, if you want them to grow faster you need to bonemeal multiple faces of the sapling or, in 2x2s bonemeal different sapplings"
0,ETHOOOOOOO
0,"Ayy an Etho upload
Windows 11 will be a pain - just make sure you disable all the bloatware and stay as far away as you can from update 24H2, if possible"
0,literally checked your channel for any recent videos last night before bed. Woke up and immediately saw a new video! I must have some kind of etho sense!
0,19:24 That reaction time was really impressive haha
0,"Windows 11 has been such a pain, good luck etho"
0,"A new PC is always exciting :D 
If you found win 10 somewhat frustrating, then win 11 might be even worse... (based on my experience and others I've talked to). With enough tinkering though, hopefully the transition goes smoothly!"
0,"35:50 Oof.
You should've watched your compatriot Linus Sebastian from LTT before making those choices.
Nvidia's latest **60 class cards (4060 and 5060) are becoming obsolete as we speak - even 16Gb Ti versions. On the other hand, 14th gen Intel chips have a design flaw, that can make particular specimens unstable under heavy utilisation."

here a mod for u to get it called Elite sound muffler Mod 
Your welcome That Mod Is u new best friend It can Mute any sound !"
60,"@11:00 That's one of the reasons we like you, Etho. You aren't afraid to experiment and make mistakes and start over and inevitably come up with something better."
3,"Hey Etho -- Isn't your tree farm affected by the Northwest rule? for a 2x2 tree to grow it needs to have a 3x3 area free *outside of the saplings forming the 2x2* -- and its centered on the NW sapling. For this check Wood blocks don't count but other saplings do.. so your tree farm setup is biased as a result, you need to grow the northmost and/or westmost tree first & it should ""unlock"" the next ones. (N W S E or W N E S depending on which way you go)"

1,this whole video is Etho vs Directionality lol
0,I literally looked at your channel 'about me' this morning (was thinking I hadn't seen a new video in a while) and was surprised you were only rocking 16gb of RAM and a 2060. Funny to me you talk about your new upgrade right after
0,Lovely to see a Hermitcraft video again!
0,Any chance you can record in 1440p? :O
0,"Does anyone know what type of indie video games Etho is into? Had he talked about it before?

I'm so deep in the indie puzzle game rabbit hole though. Blue Prince, Animal Well, Lorelei, IOI, Can of Wormholes, Taiji etc"

1,But did you get a mic stand!
0,1:34 February 18 is my birthday!
0,"The real question is... when you bought the new computer, did you get a new tissue box for your microphone?"
3,"Look at the bright side, Etho. It's been a year but you at least got the roof done!





And a full on ravager redstone minigame. So you've done a lot."
0,make sure you update your bios otherwise the 14700k is going to die
0,"Congrats on the new computer!  Sounds like a fantastic deal.

My desktop is from about 2012‚Ä¶I‚Äôm also considering getting a new one.  Need it if I want to play the games I‚Äôm thinking about getting.  I miss being anywhere near a Memory Express."

0,"Have you tried souls games? I started with Demon's Souls on a PS3 emulator.

Depending on the software and games you use, Linux may be a better alternative to Windows 11. I normally go with Fedora, but I use Windows 11 too; even though dual booting is annoying."

Also, I don't blame Etho for slacking because Ravager Rush was a passion project and it seems like he's getting by just fine without a tree farm but its still important to have. Lastly, I feel this 11:02 so much when detailing my builds! Mainly since I don't have a reference and so many blocks to choose from. It's like a going down a rabbit hole with no escape rope and then I feel like I wasted so much time but I'm always happy with the result."

0,"etho i do know what happens with the trees and why they dont grow. i know it because i do have a similar tree farm in my world and i had the same problem, but it has to do with what tree you grow first. take note on the one the order you have grow them here, because that is the order you have to do it if you want to do it using less bonemeal. 

please trust me on this, take note on the order they have grown here and bonemeal them in that order, im certain that they will grow like normal trees in the world do"

0,"Hey there Etho, congrats on the new PC! About your Windows 11 comment, have you ever considered switching to Linux? It's in a really good place right now. My gaming PC runs Bazzite (which has embedded Nvidia drivers) and it has run all games I want without issues (except Cities Skylines II but that runs like crap regardless of OS). Besides, you are quite a technical guy, so I suspect that playing around with your system might also be very fun for you, which Windows just doesn't allow.

If you are interested and are looking for pointers, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Bazzite are good places to start. The former have great documentation and expansive support forums, whereas the latter has all that (it's based on Fedora) plus a lot of stability and quality of life additions."

Now I don't even have a warranty to RMA it, though what I've heard is those who did RMA it even have issues with their replacements from the same generation. I know you'll be getting prebuilt and everything will be under warranty, but they will probably replace it with the same generation processor, which just resets the clock until you start getting errors again.

The mini games mixed in with the shops are always fun especially ones like with rocks that might not make a lot of money out still gives a reason to visit it

1,"Hi Etho, about the tree's not growing and spending stacks upon stacks of bonemeal on them. I believe that is only happening if they don't have enough room to grow a bigger tree. The code is probably saying something like ""Lets grow. Choose random tree configuration to place. Does it fit? No? Then cancel tree growth"". 

Also there seems to be a ""best"" sapling to bonemeal of the 2x2 spruce tree's. I've forgotten which direction it is but it is always the same compass direction."

If crashing while rendering videos was a concern with your last, you should consider looking into the 14 gen cpus and their issues, and possibly (depending on if the issues have been fixed or not) return the pc you got. 

Even so, at 1600 Canadian, you got *fleeced.* Especially with a 14 gen intel in there. I am not entirely sure about pricing in Canada for computer parts, but that seems *very* high for the specs that you describe. Might be a regional thing, I don‚Äôt know.

All my best,

0,"Oh boy, you might end up switching back to windows 10. I've been on windows 11 for a while and I'm really thinking of going back..."
6,"I myself am also in the process of a comparable PC upgrade. My current PC is from 2019: Core i5-9600k, 32Gb DDR4 RAM, and an RTX 3070. For this upgrade, I too wanted to get a high-end PC for once. So over the past few months I've been collecting components: I scored an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D at MSRP before their stock went all rare and prices skyrocketed, getting 64Gb DDR5 RAM, and..... I'm waiting on a video card upgrade a bit more, mainly for financial reasons. But I _was_ mighty tempted by the RX 9070 XT!"
2,Do you have a new mic stand though? haha
0,"Hey Etho, ever play Heroes of Might and Magic 3? I just got into it, can't remember if I played it in the 90s when it came out, but it really holds up."
0,Finally an etho video!
0,Im powering threw being sick and an Etho vid is just what i needed
0,What a great jump on pc specs! I hope Etho's next video will be a deluxe tissue box for is micophone.
452,"in case anyone was wondering, joel built that base as a part of a mission from the mission possible game that was made early on in the season by someone who's not on the server any more"
5,3:50 Etho uses Australian street lights
428,29:53 This ‚Äûslide-show‚Äú just blew my mind! Such a creative way to use a bundle in a video!
0,Time to try Linux :D
0,already a classic
0,"ETHO UPLOAD I REPEAT, ETHO UPLOAD"
0,"YES, SO HAPPY, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOWWW"
0,I was JUST wondering when id get to see another Etho video. Glad the answer came so quickly lol
0,Finally I can eat again

We're gettin' out of the kleenex box with this one, boys!"
0,"zero ticking was really interesting - I've never found an explanation as good as this, tysm!
10:00 wow that smoker setup is SO much better than my own design.... I never thought of making it an xp farm too! üíñ
22:40 OH GOSH that bug annoys me so much too! Do you have a  tutorial for that tree farm tho? I've tried to build it and failed so amynt imes
Thanks so much for the episode! üíñüíñüíñ"
950,"22:10 There seem to be a bug with the 2x2 tree growing algorithm. You always need to grow the north or west direction first! (depends on the rotation of the ""gear-/sawshaped"" dirt platform).
The other directions will never grow first, regardless of how much bonemeal you use :D"
12,I love the part where etho said it's tree growing time and the trees grew all over the place Absolute Cinema
0,"trees not growing drives me insane, too"
0,Finally!!
5,ethoslab linux gamer arc incoming
0,you could try linux on your old computer once the new one arrives. have fun with the new one! :)
0,"New computer! Now the question will be, will Etho finally buy a new mic stand? üòÇ"
0,what indie games have u been enjoying recently?
48,"13:45 I like how the remaining kelp float up slowly, almost like a lava lamp üòä"
12,"I love seeing all the ""behind the scene"" things and decision making."
0,hi etho
2,i'd love to see more of the building process!! one of my favourite things about watching minecraft videos is that each person's approach is entirely unique to /them/. it's one thing to be wowed by a build but seeing someone's take on a problem and/or how they view a situation & working through it /with/ them is even better imo
0,I hope you have fun with your new pc! And you can always switch to Linux when windows 11 becomes too much :P
0,"I love episodes when we get to see the creative test worlds, always makes me want to go play for myself!
& that new computer is going to help a ton! The 4060 will be plenty for indie games at 1080p, but could've probably gone a bit higher spec for video editing. Either way, 16gb to 32gb of ram will help a ton! Maybe you could treat yourself to a new tissue box too while you're at it!"
0,"Sooo‚Ä¶ Etho got a new, off-the-shelf computer for $1600 Canadian (under $1200 USD). That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a glorified gaming laptop. Etho has been making videos for years with a glorified gaming laptop. What a fkn legend üòÇ"

0,i knew i felt something different in the air today.. an etho post was coming
1,"Etho, would you consider doing a playthrough of another game such as Undertale or Deltarune at any point? I think it would be fun to see"
326,"Rock Bottom could be so fun with a random seed. Pistons retracted or not with the push of a button to create or blocks paths, removing water, etc. making each run a bit different. Obviously the best time would then be a bit luck-based, but more replayability."
11,"Gathering sand so doc can fill up his hourglass, that‚Äôs so darn wholesome etho üòä"

0,"Not now Etho, i just ate my food.."
8,"I know this is asking a lot as someone who's been watching since the 480p days, but any chance you could start uploading in 1440p with the new PC? YouTube's *really* downgraded the 1080p bitrate recently, and 1440p helps a lot to reduce the compression artifacts/macroblocking."
6,27:30 Etho.. I have ADD... That's my ENTIRE life. lol

0,Can you bless us with a new Terrafirmacraft HardRock series? Before you die and make us sad???
0,lol 1 year and were on episode 12. 1 a month on average not bad compared to the other seasons lol
0,The tiny underground base by Joel was because of the game [former Hermit member] had at the start of the season. Ahem. Hope that helped lol!
0,Glad we still got some shiny blue rock destruction !
0,Please upload in 1440p :) also idk if it‚Äôs just me but the bit rate seemed fairly low this episode? Theres a few times it‚Äôs a little fuzzy

31,"""ive never done trident pvp before"" said the man who made ripzone"
2,"Grab your morphogenetic fields and your Funyarinpas, because Etho wants to know why things don't happen until they all happen at once."
0,What if you made a wood shop and charge diamonds instead of sand like Doc. Everyone would buy from you since they all hate mining sand.
0,"Just when I was thinking it had been a while, he uploads."
0,The trees not growing is another directional thing with the 2x2 trees

0,"congrats on the new computer! i'm building my first right now and boy howdy do i agree with it being a hassle üòÖ i think i'll pay someone to do it for me in the future. hopefully your new setup makes things faster and easier for you!

i was so excited seeing that season 9 tree farm come back to life! i'm a big fan - people so rarely use purple in their builds, in large part because there's very few good purple blocks, so i've loved that build ever since you first made it. happy it will get some new use!

""timebomb"" is such a cool name for that absolutely terrifying contraption btw."

0,I've never clicked a notification so fast
0,"honestly i think asking those ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions and exploring the possibilities is a good quality to have, it just so happens to slow down episode production in ur case"

Etho you made RipZone in season 7!!"
0,"The video compression looks off in this episode. Installed Resolve/Windows updates recently?

edit: finished the episode. Has to be the fresh install. I would double-check the export/rendering settings in resolve. To me it looks like this episode was exported with a really low bitrate preset. Any time there is movement, the picture gets really mushy"
0,The redstone noises for the new kelp farm are kinda satisfying
0,"You could make a video of paint drying and we could watch it. I'm speaking for myself but I'm here for you and what you create, whether is be redstone, terraforming, or building‚ù§"

2,"Hi Etho,
Will you make a second channel where you place videos like for example: playing repo with friends. (Like grian on two much grian). Or think other side things, whatever you want, but don't want to affect the main channel.

Best wishes,
Me"

127,"2:00 I do quite like seeing the process of tiny redstone farms because they‚Äôre small doable things that I can build in my world, not massive mega redstone stuff, and as someone who doesn‚Äôt really get redstone it means that I‚Äôm not just copying the final product, but I‚Äôm almost ‚Äòpart‚Äô of the creation process"
2,New Etho Hermitcraft video right now and he is playing Among Us 3D right now with Jimmy and the Hermits so I'm actually watching that right now and will be back for the video later but can't wait

0,"I haven't got to your more recent episodes, so I'm not sure if you changed it or not, but I think you should keep the desert well, but nudge it a bit to the right (from the angle at 11:30.) That way, It's still there as a reminder from the early days of your world, but it's centred with everything you've built around it in the years since."
1,Please make me feel well and leave the well
0,"Hey Etho, any plans to play other similar games? Oddspark is really cool and I think it feets you genra"
0,I like the mismatched nature of your world. its a kitchen sink of game updates and memories.
0,"The recent updates really add to the game, minecraft has come a long way"
0,"Hey Etho! Huge fan, thanks for making great content. Just wanted to say in regard to the desert well- something that has worked for me in the past when it comes to the ""beautify the world"" vs. ""preserve the history"" argument is to just terriform around bad or awkward small builds with a hill or whatever else might match the terrain. Its a lot of work sometimes, but you get to both keep the little piece of history alive and clean up the world a bit. Hope this was helpful :)"
0,"Too busy, looks a mess to me... Anton Petrov. really good Tuber' that reviews new scientific papers... He the ""Wonderful Person"" guy."
0,"11:10 back in 2013 when i was in my first year of high school i remember being in class and exploring your world download even though i was supposed to be doing work, but everyone secretly did other stuff on our laptops if we could get away w it. i pressed this button and ended up dying which felt super embarrassing because i was hyperaware i on off had the attention of people around me. everytime you go past the well i get reminded of this hahaha. i think you should keep as much old stuff as possible. i see minecraft worlds as works of art/diary entries/stories of ones life. i've had the same world since age 20 and will be 26 in 2 weeks. i lost pretty much all of my old ones. hang on to the memories. that's my 2 cents :))"
0,"bro i‚Äôve been coming back for over a decade, please, don‚Äôt think you have to do this content optimization stuff. have some integrity"
0,thats my emotional support desert well trap
0,11:25 I remeber dying to that well years ago!!! Aw man i gott go run around your would again for some inspiration!! We love you Etho ‚ù§
0,"I like the idea of bringing in the old structure through terraforming, keeping the old is most important but it's nice to reconcile with what you're feeling now. Also fine with me if you want to change things, I don't want the world to become a pure nostalgia-fest for you or for us, change is part of that.
Idea: Could put some regular sand on the new mesa-fied land, try and make it look like the last bit of an old biome that is being desertified? You've already kind of been doing that with the way you deal with the harsh break between desert and grass with the path and mini-wall. Adds a sense of not just borders, but an active ecological process going on in the background that you've participated in combating somehow."
0,Yay etho watches veritasium üòÑ
0,thoughts on wireless redstone?
0,I'm so amazed that Etho's let's play world is still going! I absolutely love polishing work and it's a great update to do it in!
0,anyone tried to use his double piston design?build 3 of them but 1 works and the other 2 dont.. they are all in the same direction and exactly the same. wondering if anyone else had this
0,I'm sorry but leaf litter looks like p o o p
0,"Hey Etho in your recent hermitcraft video you talked about how you're not big on playing AAA games and tend to play indies. What sort of games would you recommend as I've been playing a lot of indies recently like outer wilds, tunic, deaths door, and in stars and time. Also have you played any of those games and if so what did you think of them?"
0,"I'm just getting back into Minecraft after several years away. It's a completely different game. But I am happy coming back to your channel after so long, and I still recognize where you are. üòäüòä"

0,"17:47 oh Etho, this has been a thing since carpets, lol"
0,"Will you ever do a hardcore series playthrough? I'm just asking because I'm just curious, and honestly, you're the best person to watch when it comes to minecraft."
2,"Hey Ergo, long time fan. Have you considered recording more of the ""boring"" stuff? It could be an easy way to make more episodes. That kind of low effort thing you've talked about before. Also, I used to find your building, randomness, and redstone very entertaining and informative. Cant wait to see more! Take care, byebye"
1,awaiting your return my liege
1,"I would argue against removing old landmarks like the lava well. Your 591 episode run so far spans across most stages of Minecraft and it's amazing that we can keep experiencing it in each of your videos. It's nice to freshen up the area around the place, but removing it like it never existed would feel a bit sad to me"
0,Post more videos golly
1,Hey Etho. Longtime fan. I hope you know just how much we appreciate your videos :)
1,I love how Ethos world has so much history to it even though it's a bit higglety pigglety. It's Minecraft history and should be seen as such.
1,Etho plz post
1,Etho Mr Beast Mentioned you in his build off competition on his gaming channel
1,Bros a legend at this point
0,"Hi Etho! For many people, we bought the game 10+ years ago and since then we‚Äôve had near constant free updates to the game. For instance, I bought the game one time in 2011 for $20 and have never spent another dollar on it. I assume Microsoft funds this business model through merch, Bedrock micro-transactions, etc. 

Do you think there‚Äôs a future where this business model is no longer sustainable and Microsoft chooses to charge subscriptions for Minecraft or brings in micro-transactions to Java? If hypothetically Minecraft needed a subscription, would you keep playing?"
0,Post more if you care about your fans
1,"Etho, as a big fan of your channel and your super smelter, I have to let you know that when you were building it you set a delay mechanism so the hopper minecarts go when they receive 8 items - you had 64 furnaces at the time. After you expanded to 128 furnaces, you never updated the timing mechanism, so it‚Äôs not fully optimized. Thought I would comment that even though it‚Äôs totally off topic for this video."
2,And hes gone again
0,Woooooah
0,Mr beast mentioned etho in his video üòä
0,I think the last time I watched one of Etho's videos was in 2012. For some reason the other day I had a thought of 'I wonder what he is up to these days' and am happy to see that the LP series is still going strong 13 years later!
1,"Quantum entanglement - I believe really it just means states are predetermined? Think of it like OOP - entangle(a,b)
where `entangle = (a,b) => a.spin.push(b.spin.pop())` then later if you measure `a.spin`, you automatically know what `b.spin` also is, because they have interacted. There is no actual communication from measurement, it was just pre-determined after the interaction - is the way I understood it."
0,Keep the well and also I enjoy the old quirky not super aesthetically nice part about your world it makes it feel like ethos world where it has always been just everything and random pop up builds that‚Äôs what sets your series apart from other series is how u almost capture old and new Minecraft in it and it has lots of memories I‚Äôve been watching since chocolate island and still my favorite series and Minecraft YouTuber keep doing you etho
0,Change is not something to be afraid of
1,"Hey etho have you ever thought about doing the book curroption trick on the chunks you haven't built in

Yea it will take a long time but if you created a new world with the same seed you could see where everything is and if theres cool stuff in chunks you don't have any builds in you could get them without expanding your world"

5,"Etho , i sometimes wish we could get a few more episodes than 20 each year :("
2,I check back into your channel every couple years to feel like I‚Äôm in middle school again.  Glad you‚Äôre still creating.
0,Onion science!
2,You are so talented. That final desert shot was beautiful
0,the toggleable redstone firefly particle thing could be used as a notification system that something is done
1,never change
0,To be honest... leaf litter looks like dog poop. It lacks ... color variation? Size variation?
0,I'd 'kinda' keep the well. I'd probably sink it down slightly or completely hide it somehow for some archaeology \ adventure vibes
1,Your minecraft world has been a part of my life for 12 years. I just want you to know how much you've inspired me. I'll never forget how blown away I was when you created the hopper clock. We love you Etho. Don't ever change‚ù§
2,TF2 Engineer: 17:17
2,"Hey Etho, I was rewatching your hermitcraft season 10 from the beginning and just came across the part where you explained that when you were a kid, you wanted to make video games. It just so happens that my husband has been teaching programming and prefers to teach game programming. I'm sure he'd love to teach you if you were ever interested! His name on youtube is Thundosa. And he has also been streaming some coding lessons lately on twitch if you just wanted to learn a bit :)"
1,just bought minecraft again and thought of my goat!!
0,"Some 6 months later and I have finally caught up with equally many years of this series. It's impressive to see how Minecraft has developed and how this world has evolved with it. Thank you for all the entertainment that you have produced over the years and I look forward for the episodes to come!

Psst, I'm not too concerned about the snowflake, but the other floating building wouldn't suffer from some supporting structure if you're looking for another renovation project ;)"
0,"I feel like the desert well could look really good with a fence post/stair/slab raised roof and hanging greenery and details. I know that is the original design from the game, I think it would be cool to keep the original form and then add extra detail to make it fit in more, like people used to do with jungle temples/other generated builds."
0,"call nostalgic but honestly I prefer worlds that just have a bunch or co structures. I think a theme is nice sometimes but I  just remember when I first played on multi-player and everyone built near eachother, it was a constant clash of different things. it just feels cool"
0,Keep the well but spruce it up to match everything else better!!
0,Mr beast shouted out ethoslab on his video that came out today!
0,"Personally I believe that if something doesn't work where it is due to local themeing but you want to preserve history, then you can either move the build, or change the original build to preserve the memories but make it work with the new theming of the area."
0,Still waiting on Terraria 1.4 is EZ
0,"Probably late on this but please keep things like the well, the fact that it has a story is what makes your world so good. It's not just built for the sake of it, it was an organic bit of play from you years ago!"
2,ETHOSLAB WAS ON SINGAPOREAN NEWS PAPER YALL
0,just made 1.7.6b mob spawner thanks again!
1,I vote to keep the desert well! I think it's a charming reminder of the history of this series
1,I'm always scared seeing the uploads become less and less. Etho has a legacy that needs to live on forever.
0,Finally a beach episode!
2,@Ethoslab in the new snapshots they are buffing leads! Will we be able to ask ‚Äúhow you got the llamas to walk around sandy city like that?‚Äù Again?
0,Not seen this guy since 2017.. and he still uploads..
0,Dude I used to watch you back in like 2012 till like 2016 and I literally spent an hour trying to find you because I thought your name was echo and not etho Bro it feels so weird coming back and watching your videos because I was like 10 years old now I‚Äôm 20 I just think that‚Äôs crazy. I grew up watching you bro you‚Äôre like the best Minecraft you tuber ever.
0,If I may ask how do you get your first video popular
0,How you manage to rope in hundreds of thousands of viewers each episode is commendable.
0,"35:50 I don't get why people get grossed out by medical stuff.

I have a body, I kinda want to understand how it works and how I should take care of it!!!"
0,In which video was Etho answering the question if he will play or not Vintage Story? I kind of remember he thought the Terafirmacraft developers make it.
0,"Just been watching OOGE plays Spellbound caves, not seen this since it first came out. I loved Minecraft then, so much more simple."
0,"8:00 theres too much going on, trim down on the bushes"
1,"Hi Etho, I recently finished watching this entire Let's Play from Episode 1 and  just wanted to say that your pure joy at discovering new features even after all this time is one of the best parts of the series.
P.S. In regard to episode 600 'soon' is relative. At your current rate of 1 episode approximately every 2 months we won't reach it until September 2026, almost a year and a half from now."
0,Howdy Etho! I remember watching you play Don‚Äôt Starve and just started playing again. If you were to do another run of it would you want to do it solo or with someone?
0,We miss you eefo
1,"Etho! Look up a channel called why files, they have done a great job explaining all sorts of science topics including quantum physics and this really interesting experiment where these scientists shot a particle at a board that split it in half and when it was observed vs not observed they behaved differently. Which begs the question how does the particle know we are watching it? Very fascinating stuff. But yeah I highly recommend you research that topic and look up that channel. You would love it"
0,Etho would you ever stream on twitch again ?
0,just did a 20 episode marathon man what a ride
0,It brings me endless joy to return to your channel after years of being away and seeing that same intro! I have quite a backlog to enjoy ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
0,"Who came here because ethos got
Mentioned in a new mrbeast video"
0,"I think you should keep the lava well, but I'm sentimental, so that's just me. Love the video as always ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,everytime i come to check for new videos I understand a little more what the wolf in my sp world felt when I never returned
0,"Hey Etho, thank you so much for all of the videos over the years. I get excited every time you upload, ready with my snacks! I wanted to ask, whats your favorite minecraft update that's ever happened?"
0,I just watched youre first video with youre voice and this ine man so different
0,Hey ethos I don't know if you would care or see this message since im assuming you have many many backups but I just found one of your 2013 world downloads on an old usb I had and wanted to throw something down here
0,I think the well is good but I don‚Äôt see an issue with moving it somewhere nearby that‚Äôs a bit more convenient
0,Don‚Äôt get rid of the desert well!
0,"Etho check out ""Minecraft's new Super Fast Travel Method, The Wind Elytra Tunnel"""
0,Love that ethos still here I was like 9-10 now I‚Äôm 24 and etho was crazy even back then love to see it
0,"Hey Etho love the videos been watching for 11 years now. Question, does your skin under your jacket still have your face on it or did you ever switch it to the penguin head?"
1,You make life better
0,Etho laughs like Dr. Hibbert and I love it
0,Ethoslab still going strong ‚ù§
0,"I have watched Etho for eons, always loved his unique building and insane red stone mechanics that only he understands lol,  I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs getting more subscribers and more views for his hard work..    üëçüëçüëç"
0,Definitely keep the desert well
0,Etho....I must know...have you also been addicted to Blue Prince lately
0,10:00 untouched crazy mountains are also good to watch <3
1,You gotta keep the well!
0,"im going to say that i care way, way more about personality than something being aesthetically appealing. as an artist, i can understand why, to you, it might not be so important. when you're the person making something, you see very clearly your own failures and patterns of growth and improvement at realizing your own vision. i am a staunch believer in minecraft as an art medium, and i think if there's anything you should never do, it's to delete or overwrite your old art (in this case, old builds). those are evidence of your growth as both an artist and a person, and by deleting them, you lose them forever. there is nothing i regret more in my life than throwing away countless drawings i made when i was a child, because i no longer have access to that part of my life that i thought was worthless at the time, but which i now cherish. 
all this to say, keep the little desert well. don't worry so much about not having a ""visually cohesive"" minecraft world. all the little quirks and incongruities of your world tell stories about who you are, and there is value in that.
i understand if you don't want to take it that seriously. i'm just really passionate about art and people, and how we preserve ourselves in daily ephemera. it can be a hindrance to cling too heavily to the past, but remembering old bits of fun, or your mistakes, or what you used to care about, and your past taste, these are all things worth keeping around in my opinion."
1,"Hey Etho,

One time you did a world tour with shaders. Looked pretty cool and showed off your world in a different light.


What if for the next tour you install distant horizons and preload the LODs? I think it would be cool to get a sense of where all the builds are in relation to each other."
1,"Hey Etho! 

After doing some reminiscing I was wondering if you would ever consider playing another superhostile game? I'm not sure if you can only play them on old versions but I was just thinking about how much I remember enjoying watching you play canopy carnage, legendary, and the videos with OOGE lol. Those times will always hold a special place in my heart.
Anyways, thank you for all that you do."
0,30:45 i think a big ‚Äúsacred‚Äù tree would work really well there
0,"Thank you for the insights at the very end, Etho. I hadn't thought about intentionally working learning like financial, science and other into my and my family's lives. I grew up with it, with a dad who was an engineer and a mom who was a master gardener, but for my kiddos, I have been consuming more entertainment type things. I am also living the consequences of not having seen a problem before it became a big problem, and while I am not naturally drawn to things like financial info, it would really help to have a grasp of it and I am now learning very quickly to own it out of necessity, but some education and determination earlier would have definitely made a difference for us. As always, @Ethoslabs, your perspective is valuable and I appreciate the thought you bring to things. Thank you :)"
0,It‚Äôs crazy to think I first watched you when the first let‚Äôs play episode came out 14 years ago when I was 9 years old and now I‚Äôm going to turn 23 it‚Äôs crazy how time flys by so fast
1,I can‚Äôt Wait for the 600 Tour !!
0,I think you and Rekrap would get along well! You should do a crossover!
0,"Yay, etho"
0,"Hi etho! I‚Äôve got a question, do you play any kind of instrument and what kind of music do you like?"
0,U can also till soil underwater btw
0,Ethos in the desert irl and lives in Canada??? That really only narrows it down to one spot and it‚Äôs the okanagan valley have I gotten that right????? ü§î ü§î
0,"Hey Etho. About a year ago you talked about being interested in playing Vintage Story. Since then the game has had several major updates and is in a very polished state right now. If you're still interested, there's never been a better time to get into it."
0,the office is a pretty good show
0,Don't you dare break that well üò≠üò≠
0,I would say keep the desert well. It's been part of it for years and quite the memorable part too.
0,"I know I'm missing something but I can't figure it out;
could someone tell me why you can't break the third block of a cactus to handle all the flower scenarios?

It will harvest the flower of a 2+flower, and the third cactus of a 3+flower. I do understand it won't be anything close to lossless though."
1,Fire
0,I say leave the well but perhaps move it a bit
1,"It's not unfortunate that you don't have a ""unifying theme"". I think that's why I like watching your videos and following your journey. It is way more relatable to how I have always played Minecraft. Don't get me wrong - the theme builders are great too. But so is no theme :)"
1,"Just a quick thing i was thinking, to put some stone buttons in the desert also to make it more realistic! Just a thought, i love your videos"
0,"fun fact: okay for quantum physics and mechanics (i have studied it in courses because i am a STEM major in chemistry and a sub study in physics) , its the portion of physics that has many definitions but all definitions are correct, quantum mechanics and physics are in response to when things get so small or big that they are no longer governed by the laws of classical mechanics (newtonian physics) einstien and a lot of others pioneered the field because of their studies of light, the problem is that when it comes to quantum mechanics and physics that it is impossible to be 100% accurate because alot of it is completely theoretical, like the speed and position of a photo or electron, the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle forbids anyone from telling both momentum ( mass and velocity ) and position, but by mapping out waveform and wave equations schrodinger was able to map out the concentration of electronic flow around the nucleus of the atom, of course quantum mechanics has alot of other things, where eisnstien proved that light ahs both a wave light property and a particle like property through the photoelectric effect. alot of stuff is revealed and broken by quantum mechanics because it defies our laws of physics that has governed our lives on earth, but the scope of quantum mechanics is what happens when you push the conventional thought of physics to both large and high extremes, in Etho's video he mentioned entanglement and speed of light, entaglemetn is when two particles of the exact same nature exist but are influenced by eachother no matter the distance, and the speed of light is the concrete barrier of the universe, because if you were to go close to the speed of light, you could travel forwards in time. just some fun facts if effo reads this because we're both science nerds, never felt prouder to be a nerd, love you etho!"
0,Random leaves on the sand looks like little piles of poop LOL
0,"Etho what are your thoughts on bundles? Some people seem to think they are only for early game, but I‚Äôve found them to be super useful late game too, especially as a tool pouch.
Love the videos!"
0,The FPS is getting rough bro lol
1,"I love how excited Etho got about the cactus flowers and fire flies üòÇ. Also, please don‚Äôt get rid of the desert well."
0,"I find myself coming back to watch some videos over the years I remember when I was like 8 years old watching etho build the cave and I'm now 20 years old and this always brings me peace and tapping into my inner child, thank you etho for everything and always inspiring my younger self. keep doing this thing !!! P.S. I haven't finished watching the full video but I hope you still do fan comments at the end"
0,Can you pls upload another hermitcraft video
0,"Etho,
I died to your trapped desert well many, many years ago. I've been downloading your worlds for 10+ years, it's a pastime of mine... please keep it :)
I watch you because you were the MC content I started with... played the free MC weekend in '09 or '10 and bought it immediately (didn't even have redstone at the time)
Don't change a thing you do, your content defines Minecraft content.
- A very long time fan"
0,"yo please give us a throw back UHC seasonü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ vintage beef, pause, guud, ect. I‚Äôve been a fan for over a decade and those were my favorite videos to watch. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
0,"yo etho, been watching your videos for awhile now and i know you've never told people what you did for a living before youtube, which is understandable as to why. My question to you is, how long until you made your youtube career into your full time job, assuming it is your full time job lol. Much love from a fellow Canadian <3"
0,Getting close to ep600! Can't wait for the world tour!!
0,10:51 KEEP THE WELL!!! It‚Äôs history!!!
0,1:46 I loved that classic chaos. I‚Äôm glad your world doesn‚Äôt have it!
0,"I think you should pretty up the desert well however you can, and keep it"
0,Do terra forma craft season 4
0,Doesn't your existing cactus farm just work as a cactus flower farm now?
0,I am glad to see you are still making content after all these years!(started watching in 2015 ) Great videos to watch while getting back into the swing of things with minecraft after a few year hiatus. <3. Keep the well!
1,Why do some people play Minecraft with clouds turned off? üò≠
0,HOLY COW! YOU'RE STILL AROUND?! I remember when you made Wilson in your cave! I tried to do that 11 years ago as well. Oh I hope you're doing great! SO HAPPY YOU ARE STILL UPLOADING!!!!
0,Instead of destroying the well why not improve the well? Make it part of the landscape as if it was meant to be there! I think it would be a nice way to pay respects to the original build and it becomes something pleasant to look at.
0,"Echoing a lot of other comments here, but keep the well and keep the craziness and disorganization. We watch you for you!"
0,"Etho you are the best, haven‚Äôt watched you in awhile but have been a sub for 15 years"
0,"Hey Etho, been a viewer since elementary school and now well into my college career. I was wondering, do you ever go back and watch your old videos or series? I've been journaling for a while, and I find myself reading old sections from time to time to see what my thoughts were then. And you have hundreds of hours of content spanning over a decade, I for one probably would look back. On top of that, I know I am very nostalgic for my own memories of playing Minecraft years ago, I wonder what it is like to actually have access to all that."
0,"I really like the history of the well, and I think you should keep it. You might want to make it look like a preserved site, with iron bars or some kind of small barrier around it."
0,"hey etho! remember that weird intro you did in episode 525? been watching your old vids lately as me an all my friends are falling back into Minecraft. love your farms an just the way you play the game. much love! oh! forgot the question. will you ever do another modpack series in the future? if so, do you know how far that is? totally understand if it's far future."
0,"Etho, I said this a few years ago.. please make a second channel! record all your collection and stuff, it could be long episodes and you don't even need to talk.. obviously you know a lot of people love your voice, but also seeing how you traverse the world and collect your materials would be incredible and would certainly get a lot of watchtime!"
0,does he play in the same world?
0,what about moving the well to the empty area on the left?
0,I sprained my wrist really badly and I've been using the Etho desk/mouse set up to get through my classwork! Thanks Etho!
0,bro this intro KASdkaksd
0,Jenna!!!!
0,"26:25 I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy but weren‚Äôt fallen trees a thing already or was that just bedrock? I swear I‚Äôve seen fallen trees in my world a long time ago.

Indeed I looked upon the wiki and silly pocket edition, my beloved, has had fallen trees for forever. Glad to know I‚Äôm not insane, though maybe I am for playing pocket edition‚Ä¶"
0,"Hey Etho, was wondering if you were a fan of tabletop games and what some of them might be. You seem to love the hermitcraft tcg so much after all. And a long time back you tried remaking one or two games in the world too. Dominion, Camel Up, Dixit and Marvel Legendary are some of my favorites."
0,"Etho, you feel like home"
0,Hey Etho I have been watching sense I was 6 and I‚Äôm now 17 it‚Äôs been a amazing adventure and your videos bring me soo much joy. I‚Äôm happy to see your still making them
1,I would snack the
0,Definitely keep the well
0,"Just went and checked out the Episode 500 world download I have after remembering him mentioning it this episode, and of course after 5 minutes I end up dying to general spaz. You got me Etho :]"
0,17:50 You can do this with regular carpets too!
0,i love the desert well!!!
0,12 years later and this is still my comfort videos
0,Etho! TFC has another fun update! Ever thinking of doing another TFC playthrough?
0,"You know - these updates are great; but, I do feel the game would be different if it started like this. What I mean is, these updates are awesome because of the evolution of the game. It makes it more enjoyable to play. Love your videos Etho!"
0,upgrade the well! i love it being a silly little thing there but with some tweaks it can be blended in to the new terrain
0,I think moving the well would be a good middle solution.  Just put it in a better spot!
0,"Heytho, I was wondering, have you seen the new Minecraft movie? If you have, what did you think of it, if you haven't, are you planning on seeing it?"
0,Currently listening to Vampire Empire by Big Thief
0,"You gotta keep all your previous builds, keep the history alive! Work to blend them in with the new projects, maybe turn them into ruins if it fits the need better"
1,Hey Etho with your world being as old as it is and you having to explore further and further every new update have you considered just deleting parts of your world just so you can regenerate with the newest features? As always thank you for doing what you're doing and stay awesome.
0,Etho the Minecraft gardener
0,The firefly bushes remind me of blinkroot from terraria! It might be a nice addition to caves.
0,Hey Etho! I would love to see you do a series on Craftoria if that interest you !
0,"Hey Etho, now that winter is over (at least where I am, two false springs....) what are you looking forward to the most this summer??"
12,"Hey Etho, Idk if you have noticed or if someone else has pointed it out - but the last world tour was on September 3rd 2020. If you timed it so Episode 600 released on September 3rd 2025- itd be exactly 5 years :O"
0,You should do terraria 1.4 is EZ
0,"Thank you for your comment on actively learning about things. I think it's very easy these days to just consume the content algorithms give us, rather than seek out information that teaches us and informs the way we solve problems and understand our world."
0,nice
0,I‚Äôve always watched Etho growing up every mentions all the other Minecraft YouTubers but never Etho I‚Äôm grown up now but every now and then I watch Etho he‚Äôs the one YouTuber I‚Äôll never get tired of watching. Etho was the first ever YouTuber I‚Äôve watched from a app called ‚ÄúEthoslab‚Äù I don‚Äôt see it anymore in the App Store but I sure do remember it but Etho is one of the best I‚Äôve ever watched and hope he does stop anytime soon
0,"the mesa area looks great, the well should stay, or be moved."
0,I would say no do not remove the  desert well. It‚Äôs a nostalgic part of your world.
1,"Replace the desert well with an identical red sandstone well. That way you get to keep the homage, and it transitions your deserts together üèú"
1,I love you keeping the history of your world! You have ample room to build new stuff lol
0,As a rule of thumb id say always leave everything line the well and the sand thing. I think the eclectic style of various builds is what makes your world so unique and relatable.
1,Are you going to go see the Minecraft movie
0,Etho I just checked your library on your LP world and it only goes up to E670. Is this foreshadowing! like the Mayan calendar of your LP world.
0,30:44 Move the well to this corner!! solves 2 problems at once!
0,"@6:33 EEEEK, you can see a sliver of dirt through the cracks. Someone didn't fill in their corners."
0,I know the exact blue LED video he is referring to lol
0,"Hey Etho, what's your favorite movie?"
0,"I haven‚Äôt watched this man in so many years‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad he still uploads, and he‚Äôs one of the people I wish I could meet in real life as a legend from my childhood since I was about 10‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm 28 now and boy life is beautiful and such a journey, but I never forgot about you good sir etho. Much love and thank you for always being someone I have looked up to. Stay blessed but please never stop creating content. Someday I‚Äôll have to catch up on the years I‚Äôve missed ü´∂üèº

Kids. Etho‚Äôs the OG of content and also in depth contraptions.. trust me watch his series he‚Äôs done and still has going, like the one I‚Äôm commenting on. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. 
Much love man üòå"
0,I think the well should stay where it is
0,E to the T to your mum <3
1,You should do a world tour
0,I think it would be cool to keep the well and maybe relocate it to that corner you said should have a structure! That way you keep the history but have more of an open space where you just did the majority of the landscaping and 'perdifying
1,F3: RTX 2060 ... Etho... my guy...  i will GiFT you a newer card! Just that the words:
0,"Etho, did you get the Mace yet? If not are you still going to pursue getting it?"
1,"I see what you did there, but scrap the well."
1,"Hey Etho, I was just wondering if you happened to see what squibble made with wind charges. I think one of his inventions would pair perfectly with your storage system. Squibble basically made a better enderpearl stasis chamber that can be activated from anywhere."
0,It looks like the main problem with the leaf litter placement is that it depends on your orientation. I think I might get sick from all the turning. :P
0,"Amazing episode, so comforting, love ya!"
0,I really appreciate the fact you decide to keep your old builds and spend the time to blend them in to what you want to do. I remember well when you built the sand converter!!
0,you really nailed the mesa section. It looks great and I'm proud of you for your progress on terraforming!
0,another etho therapy <3 thank you
0,"Honestly this update wasnt that bad despite being small, for me it really gave more life to minecraft worlds"
0,"Hey Etho, staying on the topic of science. How do you feel about Canadas Power generation? What do you think the future of power in Canada is? Nuclear/Gas/Both?"
34,"2:07 - I don't think your world not having a theme isn't an unfortunate thing. I think that's what Minecraft is. The fact any world can be as creative and unique as the person that plays it. It's amazing to see these medieval worlds, sci-fi, greek and such, but I find beauty in seeing a huge building very next to a space ship very next to a giant creeper statue. Rather than seeing this as a wasted opportunity, see it as an unlimited potential to build whatever you want without caring if it fits the color palette or the theme of the world."
0,Hey etho! How is chocolate island doing? I'm assuming you still have the world. How do you keep it backed up and is the process stressful? Seems so terrifying with the updates to not lose the lp world or others. Never know what they will change and how it can effect world saves.
0,"Hi Etho, do you read you comments? If you do please reply."
0,"I haven't finished the video yet but I do really like the new terraforming! I think you have improved immensely :)
I do also think the lava well should stay. It's a very old relic from the past, and I think even if you would like to keep a consistent theme, cursed desert lava well lurking outside the bounds of sandy city is cool.
tbh I don't think you should force yourself to do as others do, nor do I think you should keep everything the same forever. I think whatever style of content and building and so on that you enjoy, will be enjoyable to the rest of us, because people change and their inspirations change. 
Etho is what has kept me watching Ethoslab Videos. Not minecraft, or minecraft trends, or even nostalgia for the older days; and I believe others can say the same.
Thx for another video :)"
0,Love the new desert

0,Keep the well! build it up perhaps? blend it in with the mesa vibe?
0,"As the cactus flower is nice, I feel like (unless otherwise told) this can make cactus farms kinda a pain cause if you have a flower growing at either 1-2 tall cactus, and they dont break with a block next to it, it‚Äôll block production if it grows at those heights? Am I wrong? Yes you can use a piston or observer but like if you want mass production and the obverse is at 3 tall and it grows at 1-2. Then it ruins it? Idk may just be me"

0,"Hey Etho - wondering if you‚Äôve thought about giving out shoutouts in your Lets Play -videos? You and the community probably know many smaller channels that would deserve more eyes on them, and could be an interesting angle to present one at the end of an episode. Spreading good across the community. Got the idea when found ComplexHobbit who has a rather crazy Shire -build with not that much audience."
0,"Veritasium did that blue LED video right?

If so, that was a good one."

0,how has this guy not fallen off with minecraft lets plays in 2025
0,I feel the lava well has to stay. Its kind of like The Ugly Brick Thing (tm). Its at lest one of those things I really think about when talking about your desert
0,"Keep the well. Since it‚Äôs man made and not naturally generated, I‚Äôd be okay if you move it to a different part of the dessert city where it fits better. But something to pay homage is better than removal only."

0,Don't you dare touch that well!
0,"Quantum physics is overall easier than classical non-relative mechanics or EM in a theory or mathematical sense.

As for the well, I thought originally it was just an extra lil feature of the space! Maybe you could make it a custom well instead of a minecraft one?"

0,Thanks for the video! I know your favourite show is Seinfel but I'm wondering if you also enjoy more modern film/television? What are your favourite shows/films from recent years? Maybe you have thoughts about modern cinema trends?
0,"I'd say keep the desert well, but pretty it up a bit. Change some bits around, add some detailing that isn't there on the vanilla ones, find a way to work it into the environment a bit more... that sorta thing."
0,You could upgrade or transform the desert well
0,11:00 I think you should move the well to that other small desert area off to the left behind the orange structure. That way you can keep the history but clean up the bigger area because imo its a bit out of place
0,"love how you first decided to polish the desert BEFORE the update and yet most of the new blocks got used for it, peak foreshadowing"
2,"I like that there's no unified idea. All those themed youtube worlds feel like they're putting pressure on me to also have a unified theme in my world, but I don't want to"
1,"Hi Etho! One thing you might consider with your foliage placement in the new mesa teraformed area is where the water will go when it rains. You‚Äôve already got something that looks like a dried basin where it‚Äôs drier in the middle than it is in the sides, which really looks great. When I‚Äôve been in the desert, the lower elevation areas tend to have less or shorter foliage because they would be the areas where the water sticks around longest after it rains so it would get washed away in a flash flood. You already seem to be heading n that direction, but it‚Äôs just something I thought about. Great video as always! Have a wonderful day!"
0,Moving the well down near that empty area you mentioned building a ‚Äúnew grass farm‚Äù could be a good way to maintain the history without it being in an odd spot
0,"As an artist. sayi g you dont have a  theme reminds me of artists saying they dont have a ""style"" Every artist has a style/theme naturally. I think your world does have a theme - its Etho. Everything sorta just works together just because youve made everything. 

Also, not having a major storyline makes 500+ episodes a lot more digestible. People can start wherever, and theyre not gonna be overwhelmed with lore."
0,Leave the well! It's history :)
0,11:00 Keep the well Etho! That's history right there
1,"I‚Äôd move the well down into the empty end of your little desert, right in front of where you‚Äôre thinking of putting another little mesa. I think it would give a reason why the wall extends down that way."

0,that desert landscaping turned out amazing!! i love that colour palette mixed in with the bright sand.
0,"Leave the desert well. It‚Äôs ugly, but one thing I love about your world is all the tiny landmarks that have accumulated over time. Plus, the new landscaping around it makes the area look nice, even if there‚Äôs nothing particularly exciting about well itself."
0,"It's cool when you place them. But when you have clear bushes for every build it gets a little annoying. Obviously I have played a lot of modded minecraft. That happens a lot in modded minecraft. You get a bunch of random junk that adds interest to the world, but at the same time, when YOU want to do something all of that stuff suddenly becomes an annoying obstacle in your way. There is a balance somewhere."

One option would be for elytra to work differently in different dimensions so they would still be effective in the end."
0,"Hi Etho,
I know you've touched on this before but it was especially apparent to me in today's episode with the goal of pertying up the place. I'd love to see some very basic, vanilla-adjacent shaders in your videos. I was especially struck by it around the time in the vid that you were talking about blue LEDs. Minecraft's blue gradient skies just don't match your beautiful structures, custom trees, etc. I agree one of the amazing things you've done with this series is keeping it vanilla, but it just doesn't do your builds or your world justice. Even a nice sky box with no fancy lighting features would do wonders in my opinion. Keep on keeping on! Thanks!"
1,"Etho, you don't need a theme. This world represents your journey, and that's all that matters.

I also wouldn't be too scared about changing your content. I think you'll find that a lot of your subscribers are long term fans...

0,Nooo etho dont get rid of the well...
0,"My first thought at 19:57 was ""don't eat the brown sand"" lol."
0,You should move the well to the left in the little nook you got going on. Then it‚Äôs a nice structure to show some history to your world without getting rid of it. Like so Ergo can see

0,love the chaotic style of building that you do!
0,You've poured so many diamonds into that well. I think it's a treasure to the world. So maybe replace the well with something that pays homage to it.
0,The sand sounds like creepers and it was stressing me out the whole video
0,"I want to chime in that I love the chaotic, storied look of your world! Especially with your LP being one of the oldest in existence, I think that's part of the charm! Not that new developments or changes are bad, but I certainly don't think anyone is looking at features of the world and thinking they are outdated and therefore bad."
0,"Edit: Argh, I don't like the cactus flower mechanics. That breaks passive cactus farms if you don't use pistons... I do like everything else in the update though. I'm actually impressed on the side of ""more features"" rather than less. There aren't major structure changes (a lot of work but nonetheless affecting only a small area), but I feel like the world is more immersive now.

I've also seen the blue LED video. That was fascinating. One of the better explanations of band-gaps I've seen, but wow does that stuff still confuse me. I start getting a headache whenever I try to think about how colors are a result of weird quantum stuff and needing to shape molecules to have the right quantum bands to be new colors in the visible range... structural colors are really cool though.


I don't want to see the world getting a ""theme."" You already have one. I'll admit, if you make a dedicated biome change, like when you did the wheat field, sure, that's cool. But we started watching because you're a technical builder. Your world is full of devices you've made that do something, and the landscape is built around them (so, to that effect, adding landscapes around builds is good, and I love how the mini-mesa looks). I like that the landscape also looks nice, and it's been amazing to see your skill at that improve over the years, but I don't want you to lose that ability to make cool tech first and megabases second.


As for whether to remove old builds that can't function anymore (like the sand converter)... I have mixed feelings. Sure, if a design is broken by an update and just needs modernized because Redstone works differently now, fishing changed mechanics for the 18th time, or just can be made more efficient, I think it can replaced or updated in place. But something that was removed from the game, like the sand or old ice farms... on one hand, historical value. On the other hand, something else could go there. I'm honestly undecided on that part.

Please keep the desert well, though. That's definitely historical material and it's not ""nonfunctional."" Admittedly, it's not horribly functional either, but there's no reason to get rid of it."
0,you have to keep the well!
1,"Leave the old stuff!! The big sand farm, should just build something around it!"
0,I would keep the desert well. Maybe move it to that place that you said needed a structure?
0,"Instead of a wall by the river, why not extend the desert down to the river?"
0,You could move the well to the little side area where you suggested the farm goes. That way you get to keep it while also opening up the main desert area
3,"Tip for anyone trying to replicate the flower farm that Etho demonstrated here. If you run into the issue that the pistons don't work properly it might be an orientation thing. Facing North might not work, but facing South does. And facing West doesn't work, but facing East does. That kinda thing."
0,Keep the well! It's history! Maybe add a roof that ties it into the new area a little better?
167,"I‚Äôve finally done it. I watched every single episode of Etho Plays Minecraft Season 2. 486 episodes starting at 105 and ending at 591. It seemed like such a big task when I began yet here I am, quite sad that I don‚Äôt have 100 more episodes to watch. 

I still remember the first video I watched from you 12 years ago. I think it was episode 290. I used to watch other youtubers playing minecraft survival at my school library‚Äôs computers, but they didn‚Äôt get very far or technical with the game. One day a guy came up to me and asked ‚ÄúDo you want to see what real minecraft survival looks like?‚Äù and pulled up your channel. I was fascinated at how advanced you were at the game, yet I understood nothing (neither the game mechanics nor english).

Years later I rediscovered your channel and watched your videos on and off with the goal in mind that one day I would watch your entire survival series, and I finally did it.

Throughout the series a few things stuck out:

How you and your episodes changed significantly while not changing much at all. You became livelier, more dynamic and charismatic, and as a consequence (coupled with the current standard of videos on youtube) the quality of the episodes improved a lot while barely changing the formula that you always stuck to. You‚Äôre still the same man who views doing youtube primarily as a fun hobby and focuses on bringing new, creative ideas to the table instead of appealing to the current trends. I do admit that I miss the ‚ÄúLet me see... what will we do today?‚Äù of the older episodes back when simpler videos we‚Äôre the standard, though.

Your progress with redstone and building. Your progress in redstone skills was like a flight of stairs, and there were three main steps: the pop-up sheep farm, Wilson, and the Nexus, after which you became the redstone wizard that you are. Your building, on the other hand, was like a map composed of mountains and valleys. One episode you would build something amazing, then turn around and build, well, the Ender Dragon egg room (the old one, of course), yet after a while, through persistent effort you became the amazing, consistent builder that you are nowadays.

The way your world changed in the last 100 episodes. Before, it was neat collection of structures, projects and builds, but after you started your biome enhancement project you made your world more cohesive, structured and pleasant to look at. In my opinion, not only is your world the greatest survival world in minecraft, but also the most famous/iconic. It contains the first iterations of redstone contraptions that are staples nowadays, and it is recognized at a distance by millions, as it has been a part of the childhood of people who are now adults with degrees, jobs, and/or a family.

And the thing that kept me more amused than anything was seeing when certain structures or contraptions were built and when things that are old news nowadays were added to the game. Every other episode I found myself thinking ""Oh my God, *this* is when he built this?"" or ""This was added *that* long ago to the game? It felt like yesterday."" I was surprised at how early on you mentioned the Nexus or how certain iconic parts of your world were built so casually. For example, the episode where you began building the entrance to the man cave doesn't even mention that in the title even though it is a very important part of the build.

Something else that stood out was the ""recent"" change in your mindset when it comes to farms. Before you didn't mind afking at all and you often prioritized originality/creativity over eficiency: your original design of the witch farm reflects that best. Also, the designs have certainly increased not only in size but complexity, which I guess is in part due to the saturation of minecraft content on this platform but also due to this mindset change.

Anyways, there‚Äôs obviously much more to say but this is boring enough as is, so here‚Äôs a quick question: is Pakkun still alive?

Thanks for entertaining and inspiring millions of people. You're one of the greatest youtubers of all time, that's for sure."
0,"He is alive! ü§ó Just kidding, its actually not that long since he uploaded, but i am just picky and only like the singleplayer stuff üôÉ"
0,"Something I was hoping to see was the cactus flowers attracting bats in the same way bees ""pollinate"" flowers in this game. Lots of species of cactus are bat pollinated. I guess it'd be tricky to implement without killing the bats. 

Cactus farm efficiency has been thoroughly nuked this update with the flowers growing at any stage and not breaking when adjacent to a block. This hurts as cactus remains the only viable means of getting green dye in bulk and I wonder if the developer considered that when implementing the change."
0,You should keep the well but since it's man made I think you should be allowed to move it to a better location
0,"I would say keep it as its fairly nostalgic for me, but maybe hide it from sight by wrapping it in 'desert trees' or the like so its something visitable but not part of the general feel of the area as you are passing through."
0,"You should totally leave the fountain! Maybe even build around it like it's an old monument, or sculpture. Heck, maybe you could create story around it with the right builds that just give the impression ""Some guy just left this here and we don't know what to do with it..."""
0,"I have a fond memory of that desert well trap, but it is entirely up to you what you do with it! The design in that desert strip looks great!"
0,"The way the bush and firefly bush spread when bonemealed, should be added to lilypads too.
Also I wish you could harvest the dry grass and make it into a dry grass mat, that has similar mechanic to carpets. Just so we can have some beige/sand colored carpets."
0,"Leave the history. I think a lot of it is way cooler than the potential ""upgrade"" that would replace them."
0,"I think you should remove the self made desert monument, because it doesn't add anything unique to the area so less is better in this sense. Furthermore I would tone down a lite bit on the terrain details, in this case the colors stand out a lot so decluttering it a little bit makes sense. Anyhow amazing video! Its allways nice to see a new upload :)"
0,Not sure if you‚Äôll see this but it might be a good idea to clump the desert grass near structures or natural stone. All the crevices of the structures and stone could potentially hold water that would help the plants grow. Kinda like how you see weeds around the edges/cracks of driveways.
0,"Terraforming isn't really for me, I think the history of the world and the changes is cool. Who cares if things don't blend in, that's half the fun! It will be interesting to see in another 10 years if people are still terraforming and blending, or if they've moved on (or backwards) to something else."
0,"If you feel the well doesn't fit, then it doesn't.
I love the building episodes, btw ! Awesome custom biome !"
0,"I like the well and maybe you could move it to the empty space on the other side of the path? It feels like the perfect space for it to me. Also I'm not the biggest fan of the scattered leaves in the open space  but maybe with the cluttered new grass it looks a bit better. Over all I love the improvements on the desert! Whenever I watch you design something, you always challange what I think goes well together. Every time I'm sceptical at the beginning but it ends up looking great! For example this time, I was sure the tuff would stand out too much and be too harsh of a texture but you blended it in so well. Love it!"
0,"Hi Etho, why not use that small area to the left of the sand converter to house the well? Maybe change the well to have a bit more mesa coloration in it as well. 

Love the videos, I've been watching since chocolate island and you're the best notification to pop up on my feed. I always have my snacks ready!"
0,"Oh, I saw that blue LED video I think. It was super interesting. :)"
0,Great vid Etho!
0,"Move the well to the other deserty bit using the exact same blocks, and redo the well there to fit the theme :)"
0,After 591 episodes this is the firsts I‚Äôve watched in an airport
0,"maybe keep the desert well, but redesign it"
0,Not just moss carpet you can place on water. Any wool carpet can be too
0,Mojang **SPoiLing** us by making more decorative blocks placeable on most blocküòÇüòÇü§©
0,I wouldn't stress too much about your world not having one big theme. You and this world are cut from a different cloth compared to these newer worlds and I think that your world having just random things is a nice thing that makes it unique.
0,Id say retexture the desert well slightly. Just a little revamp to make it blend in a but better but keep the structure!
0,remove the sand fountain with the lava
0,28:03 I am pleasantly surprised too. I honestly thought they would look way more aggressive/busy.
0,keep the well
1,"Hey Etho! I was wondering, what are your thoughts on pruning chunks? have you ever done it in your world? The thought came to me when i remembered you where considering changing your world from  an amplified world back to default, now with chunk blending, there aren't harsh chunk borders when changing version (which i always found ruined my immersion) so i was wondering if you've considered pruning chunks along some of the old version change chunk borders and letting them regen with the new blending. Also, I wanted to add my thoughts on switching to default, I thing there are positives, as its really difficult to build in amplified terrain, and you already have amplified terrain to use if you want to, default would let you explore and build in new biomes and features without the added chaos, hope you're doing well!"
0,"I love the desert well, just cover it with a few leaves it‚Äôll look fine lol"
0,"Loved the terraforming episode! Hey Etho, can you clean up the portal room below the stronghold base next?"
0,Leave the well please. You killed me with it when i downloaded the world - it's history
0,Please keep the desert well!
0,dont get rid of the well it tells a story if you put more dry grass around it it might blend in better this my first comment i have been watching for 7 years keep being an amazing youtuber you are the first youtuber i ever watched so thanks you for showing me the youtube comunity
0,Save for the well‚ù§‚ù§
0,8:26 me when I break the grass of pain and agony üíî
0,"Finally something mostly unrelated to redstone. lol
As someone who quit MC so long ago it's like the least relatable and thus enjoyable content. So you working on overly complex redstone circuits is about as entertaining as watching someone write code with me not being able to actually read it (not dissing anyone who finds enjoyment in that)."
1,@veritasum Call out !!
0,Keep the well! I died to it!
0,Heyo I‚Äôve had the worst week ever so thank you etho
0,Gotta keep the well. Just update it to fit the area
0,"I think it would be unfortunate for you to tear down old builds just because they don't fit the newer vision of Minecraft. That world is a piece of history on its own, I hope you don't modernize it too much."
0,7:30 oh that's a *lovely* scrubland üëçüëç
2,"Cohesive worlds are awesome and perfectly suited for builders like Bdubs Ross, but Etho's world has its own direction that better matches his playstyle."
0,"It‚Äôs a little thing, but I love that Etho actually fills in spaces rather than just covering them up"
0,don't take down the desert well!
0,"17:55 you can place any type of carpet on water and lava
Also, if you want a fun channel to learn about animals, I recommend ""Casual Geographic"""
0,"Honestly at the end with all the stuff, the well doesn't really look that out of place anymore lol"
0,"DON'T TOUCH THE WELL!
Make it work."
0,"I agree with a what a lot of people here are saying about make sure to keep your style and don't feel like you have to do stuff you don't neccessarily want to do, although if you do want to do it, then thats your prerogative completely. Loved the episode, hoping we can get some more soon."
0,Etho confirmed to be a Technology Connections enjoyer
0,"the desert grass in the mesa looks surprisingly good, wonderful contrast."
0,"hey it looks great etho, good job"
0,Must keep the well üëç
0,"make it a split down the middle type aproach, keep it with a revamp to match the current scenario it finds itself in, is wahat i suggest"
0,Keep the well
0,"I did not know you could use moss as a bridge, thank you so much that's huge"
0,"11:40 You could ""move"" the well to a different spot? It's not a massive build so wouldn't be too tricky and then every time you'd see it, you'd have the added history to it of it being moved rather than wiping it from history entirely."
0,The well stays
0,Are you able to put cactus flower on top of moss carpet? With that moss carpet on water you could make giant lily pads‚Ä¶even for a frogger game or oasis/swamp
0,"Etho, I hope you read this, I've been watching your videos sinds I was maybe 14, which is half my life. 
I've moved on now, you've been awesome man. 
Thank you for the fun."
180,"Yo Etho I just realized - I am a grown ass man now, 32 years old. I‚Äôve been watching your content since like what‚Ä¶.. episode 6 into chocolate island?! Duuuuude it‚Äôs been so long and guess what: I still drop everything I am doing when you upload! New videooooo <3 Thank you so much for all the years man ‚ù§"
0,"Etho, I‚Äôve been watching you since I was a young lad. I‚Äôve spent countless hours playing Minecraft watching your videos building amazing things creating some of the best memories with my brothers. I am now 25 and have a son, I can‚Äôt wait to show him your videos and play with him."
6,"""If you aren't learning something every day..."" I had a Pavlovian reaction waiting for the Brilliant sponsorship, but of course it was just Etho giving life advice üòä"
0,"Etho! We know you love to read, watch and learn about things. What‚Äôs the best book you‚Äôve ever read that taught you valuable real world useful knowledge?"
0,"I like that your builds don't have 'one unifying theme' !!! It's definitely more creative and really showcases the history of your world ^^ plus, I think one thing that minecraft builders miss, especially when making cities and stuff, is that... even in the real world, uniformity doesn't exist. Most places have a lot of diversity in their architecture, whether it's because of differently used materials, different builders, different eras.... etc. And that's why a lot of minecraft towns feel kinda unrealistic to me. Almost dystopian in a way.. cause everything looking the same and harmonious betrays either EXTREMELY TIGHT organisation and planning.. or a lack of allowed creativity, or both. So!! This kinda turned into a rant, but I love your world, and your whole vibe, so please don't loose that unique spark that you have in favor of being like everyone else. We love you cause you've always been yourself above all <3"
0,Move the well over to the new cornor where you want to build some structures
0,I just realized ive been watching ethos for 12 years unsubscribed üòûüò≠
0,"Hey ergo, I think that maybe keeping the well but turning it into an abandoned one could be a cool refresh while also preserving history."
0,What if you moved the well to the back left corner where you would talking about adding a structure for farming the plants? that way you keep the history but it's less in the way
1,"I'm only 30 seconds into the video, and just want to say right off the bat that these polishing episodes are some of my absolute favorites throughout the LP series. There's obviously so much enjoyment in the grandiose projects and redstone innovation, but something about walking through the old world with new materials, tips and tricks hits SO hard EVERY time.

Editing at 7:35 ETHOOOOOMG THIS IS WHY THESE EPISODES GO SO HARD EVERY TIME"
0,"I love the lava well and how quirky it is, but don't be afraid to move it to another section if you think you need to"
0,"hey etho, possibly east solution for the cactus flowers: why not break the cactus that‚Äôs second from the bottom? might lose efficiency, but you could gain efficiency with scale"
0,Pls leave the desert lava well
0,"Hi Etho, Are you excited for the Minecraft movie?"
0,Is there a youtube channel that would allow me to learn new things every day?
30,"Thank you for answering my partner's question as the Comment of the Day. We started yelling when we saw it pop-up. I'm glad it was such a thought-provoking question and I hope it leads to many rabbit holes for you (and not the kind you twist your ankles in, in England)! To say that quantum physics has changed our lives is an understatement. I hope you find many adventures as you dive into the world of the unknown!  We love you, Etho! Keep up the great work in making your world fun.  (You've also inspired a lot of physics enthusiasts to come out of the woodwork with that comment!)"
0,Love the mesafication!
0,"Oh look! Etho's talking about my area of research! So, the best way to think about entanglement is my mind is to think of it as one massive particle with 2 sides, where the 2 sides are like the sides of a coin. So, if you measure one side of it, of course the other side changes instantly since it's one particle, but also, of course you can't send useful information along it instantly, since, if you flip a coin and see one side is heads, you now know the other side is tails, but that doesn't give you any useful information.

(unless you also communicate about you're measurements, but that means you're communicating below light speed again)"
0,"I feel like the mesa terrain has way too much variety/complexity for being right next to a desert. I would simplify it and remove some blocks completely, like less types of leaves for example"
0,does the new cactus flower break most cactus farms now? because the 1 tall cactuses have a chance of growing a flower instead of a cactus?
0,"The new update is so well done. More life in nature is the exact thing minecraft needs. BTW the ""problem"" with your plant placement is that they are space too evenly. Same thing as when children try to draw a sky with stars. They always space them evenly instead of in clusters."
0,wowww super impressed with the desert terraforming. great colors
0,"I think you should keep the well because you physically made it and it would be sad to see it go but thats just me, if you want to get rid of it that's your choice, sorry if that wasn't helpfull lol"
0,"quantum entanglement goes faster than light. It's almost retro causality. I think about something I've heard where a photon does not experience time. From it's point of view, it is both emitted and absorbed at the same time(time dilation). So it could be seen as something that connects the universe and possibly transmits information about what absorbed it(thus, what's in that direction a billion years from now). It really hints that time is weirder than we think... or that it doesn't really exist how we think it does"
0,Etho have you tried vintage story yet?
2,33:10 34min and 6sec is the optimal time between harvests. (Calculated it from random tick rate of blocks and linked binomial distributions)
0,What if you made the old sand converter building into a scam roadside attraction that claims it can convert sand but it's really just slight of hand
0,Put a fence around the desert well and treat it like a tourist attraction.
0,"I really like te leaf litter, but how cool would it be if we could dye the creaker resin!"
0,@Etho what if you make the redsand building into like something similar to a corruption? Kinda like the crimson in terraria!
0,"2 things!

about terraforming: when decorating, smaller spaces, i think it is important to decorate in clusters instead of sprinkling your deco out so evenly, because you want the eyes to travel from one interesting little spot to another only a few times as you walk around, and when deco is spread around so evenly, then it gets very busy for the eyes, and they have to basically hop around too many not-so interesting spots, which might have an effect you dont want.

and the other point: the desert bushes could look hella cool if you place a few patches within your wheat fields, to have it be a little less monotone! idk tho, havent tested it yet."
1,I'll save you some time if you decide to build a cactus flower automated farm that doesn't use observers. The optimal harvest time is in 34 minute intervals (34 min 6 sec) if you harvest the top 2 blocks :)
0,Rip the massive sugar cane farm
0,"I had an idea for if you ever wanted to blend your snowflake farm with the surrounding environment.  Create a localized area of winter around the base of the water stream, like it's a terraforming UFO."
0,good epsiode etho! :D
0,Etho! Will you play Vintage Story ??
0,Please play Vintage Story.
0,desert well has GOTTA stay
2,"Please keep the history, it's one of the things that make your world unique! Although I only have been watching this series for a couple of years, the bits I love are the experimenting with new updates, and the relaxed pace of those episodes - the massive projects are cool as well, due to your unique take on things, but this episode was reminiscent of earlier Minecraft videos - and I love it!"
0,"Hey Etho, I just want put this question out, so you have the option to respond to it if you want. Why do you give so little ""etho lore"" to the fans, like your growing up stories, you family stuff, if you have a girlfriend/wife and kids, car stories, do you have pets now, what is your address, okay the last might be too much don't answer that, so why do you chose not to disclose much about yourself? Are you afraid someone like rainbolt will track you down?"
0,Definitely keep the well!
0,We Keep It.
0,You should upgrade the desert well and call it a part of the Biome Enhancement Project.
0,I feel like the fireflies would also be cool in a fire type terrain like what rendog built a few hermitcraft seasons back to give the feel of like ash or cinders flying around
0,I would keep the well just blend it in
0,"Hey etho! For the 600 episode special you should do a clip montage like the 200 episode special, I think it would be really cool to see some highlights over the years. Just an idea"
0,"Thank you SO much for answering my question! Quantum physics can be very confusing. I‚Äôd been lucky enough to take a class back when I was in college that covered quantum physics, and it was life changing. The more you start to understand, the more questions you end up with, haha! But it‚Äôs very fascinating‚Äîdefinitely watch videos on it that interest you!

And these are some of my favorite types of videos from you! It was really fun, and I always learn something new! You‚Äôve come so far in your building/decorating/terraforming, and it‚Äôs so inspiring!"
0,"An idea for deprecated and historical structures in your world which no longer fit in with the overarching theme, like the red sand converter in the desert: you could encase them in a modern building with glass walls and everything and turn them into a museum, with books/signs telling their history and their age, and have a little historical world tour ready for anyone exploring the world."
0,The terrain looks so great
1,Those firefly bushes would look great in de main cave. Imagine having it sparkle all fantasy like.
1,"It isn't just moss carpet but any carpet you place on water. It's good for maps where you can use frost walker, place the carpet on the ice and when the ice melts the carpet stays."
0,you could make a hidden trail with fireflies to guide someone
0,"30:39 I think the well would be a perfect structure to put here! It would tie together that area perfectly imo, and as a relic of the past i think the fact that it stands out and doesn't fit in with the rest of the place actually gives the area more character and depth, like an old historic statue in an otherwise modern town"
0,Get some bunnies and hide their lead. I think the only thing missing is a little ‚Äúlife‚Äù.  Beautiful world!
0,please keep the desert well! maybe replace some of the blocks and pimp it out but it's history and small structures are cool which is exactly why they were added to the game all those years ago
0,"Greetings Etho!  I've designed a cacti farm using the double piston design that you showed in this video. I'm not a professional redstoner, but I discovered that you may want to join all the piston mechanisms by the block where the redstone repeater is looking at and not by the glazed terracotta (or the not movable block) one. Why? Because in my design I connected a hopper clock and a simple redstone torch upper line to control the farm. In my design, if you connect the piston systems by the glazed terracotta, there's one spot that cannot be farmed properly, but changing to the block where is looking at there are no losses. I hope I have explained it well."
0,Keep the well!
0,"17:51
I did not, in fact, know this :)"
0,Awesome video.
0,you could move the desert well over to the other side where you said you need a structure :)
0,etho experiment episode! :D
0,"With each new MC update episode in this series, i'm reminded of 2 things: how much Etho loves this game, and how much i hate amplified world generation (because we get to see it when Etho explores)."
0,"Maybe it‚Äôs controversial of me, but I honestly really like the idea of trying to unify your world. Because it‚Äôs like a new way of trying to creatively connect a bunch of your buildings and projects together and I‚Äôm just a general fan of seeing terraforming and world transformations in Minecraft. Ultimately, I like watching you do what you like to do, and when you don‚Äôt enjoy it, I don‚Äôt want you doing it. Likewise if you are having fun doing creative projects, it‚Äôs fun for me to watch it with you. Keep it up ergo, you‚Äôre close to your 600th!"
2,"my god my jaw dropped at the terrain reveal, that terraforming is gorgeous"
0,Etho watches technology connections! Never thought that would be a thing
0,"I say blend the well into the scene. Dilapidate it a little maybe, add some of the new mesa colors encroaching onto the well. Keeps the history while also looking like it belongs and showing a little passage of time."
0,Thanks for the learning reminder ‚ù§ I really enjoy The History of the Universe 's videos - astrophysics is so fun (and quantum physics comes up a lot too)
0,hey etho i have an idea for something you should try to do before episode 600. it would be nice if you finished your stronghold base or atleast the end portal area so it wasnt so messy. I think you could keep everything thats there but build around it. i know its been unfinished for a long time but i think it would be an interesting project and would help the world to feel more complete
0,"I would keep the desert well as a homage to that release.

We received so many different unique mechanics and design elements from that release it's hard to compare."
0,Going to be adding a lot of underground firefly bushes in snow biomes
0,But the real question is..... how did you get the llamas to walk around sandy city like that?ü§î
0,I love how you started working on enhancing this little area and the next moment they released EVERY item for it to work better
0,Leaf litter on top of glazed brown terracotta looks really cool!
0,Good Video Etho üëç
0,"Keep the well, but maybe spice it up?"
0,"The red transitional area between mesa and desert looks good, somewhere between a gradient and a mess. It's my first time seeing the new plants, and I find them quite interesting. Especially the dry grass ‚Äî you could make an awesome, decorative wheat field with it. Good video."
0,"So if I want to start watching this series now, what should i do?"
0,Oh my
0,"Along with other things similar to the desert well, I've always thought you could just update the look by making it a bit dilapidated and fence it off so that we keep the history but it fits in a bit more."
0,It‚Äôs always over too soon üò≠
0,"Man I had a disagreement with someone not too long ago about the true primary colors and I ended up going down a rabbit hole learning about the primary colors and LEDs, super cool stuff! Would definitely recommend watching a video on the primary colors cause I can‚Äôt imagine the full picture is very common knowledge"
0,Keep the history!
0,"boabab style desert trees, or tree dracena (draco)? narrow fence post trees in white/pale wood with gtreen candles as waxy singular leaves?"
0,"Etho, a really artistic blend of colors on the orange Mesa transition! Amazing job with that lighting and color balance. Really has a good vibe. (Unfortunately we humans still have an alternating cycle) mostly magnetism.. I blame the imbalances on house-wiring shifting magnetic fields. But that Mesa blooming.. üòä real color."
0,I also watched the blue LED video!
0,"For the dithering, you could try adding a line of gravel between the sand and dirt, and the three mixing into each other might help make it a little smoother of a transition"
0,"Wow, don't know when I was this late before"
0,its instant!
0,"I kinda think every plant should be placeable on every natural block or even any block in general. This would give so much freedom for detailing. 

Sure a flower on obsidian wouldn't look good, but thats the decision for the player to make. We can build homes out of sponge, glazed terracotta, and dirt, so why not be able to have ugly plant placement too."
0,You could use the well as an old source of water for one of the custom trees! Then you get to keep the well but also give it some purpose with a custom dry/dying tree for decoration!
0,The well is a part of history. Could be made into a statue or memorial looking thing
0,YOU TOTALLY WATCHED VERITASIUMS VIDEO ON THE BLUE LED
0,"For future building with desert grasses, often grasses also trap sand, creating Dunes, so if you want to break up an area you can create a little sand dune, and put some grasses on it to explain how the dune grew"
0,Convert the desert well into the red sandstone?  That would help it blend in more with the mesa nearby.
0,"about the well, I think if it has history, it overrides the fact that it does not belong 100% with the asthetic but, if you want to remove it and keep the memory, you could move it to another spot and make a lore build, like showing how it was moved somewhere else, idk... Also I think the spontaneous builds in your world, even if everthing is not connected perfectly, its awesome to see and gives a lot of personality"
0,"Hey Etho, why not move the desert well into that corner of desert that needs something? You get to both preserve the history and decorate the space"
0,"This might sound silly, but im proud of your terraforming in this episode, I think you‚Äôve improved even just since that last hermitcraft episode"
0,Fallen trees have been in mjnecraft for years
0,Big numbers are a lot ngl
0,etho my favorite color is orange dont feel bad about people not liking it cause i like it
0,Bedrock had fallen trees for a while love em. Didn't know they weren't in Java till now atleast
0,If you want a decent grasp of entanglement I suggest looking up some videos on the Bell inequality. The experiments show faster than light effects and preserve the rule from relativity that no information can travel faster than light.
0,bdubz forrest in hermit craft needs you to prank him with fireflys hell never see it lol
0,"etho your landscaping has improved by leaps and bounds, the badlands effect with the tuff is amazing"
0,11:00 move the well? It's a hard choice ngl
0,Hi ethoüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è‚ù§
0,Change up the well? Maybe add a sign in its replacement
0,"Keep the well...or don't, I'm not the Minecraft police. Or am I?"
1,"hey etho! what is ur most recent ""cool thing you learnt""? i love how helpful tour tips are on basically everything! thank you so much!"
0,Relocate the desert well to that corner?
0,"I only watch a video from you every so often. And somehow. The last 3 were all related to the desert.   
HOW. Entirely by chance"
0,I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA TALK ABOUT VERITASIUM
0,"The answer to the quantum entanglement question is this:

Entangled particles (if measured some distance apart), will have entangled outcomes ""instantly"". Partial measurements of one particle that affects the outcome of the other particle also happens ""instantly"".

However, it can't be used to transfer any information, as you have to compare the results of the two measurements to see the effect of the partial measurement (it is perfectly undetectable with only one of the measurements), so if you try to send information with entanglement, you have to send your outcomes, which is still limited by your other methods of sending information, which are all limited by the speed of light (as far as we know).

However, who knows if it's really accurate to say it happens instantly, because simultaneity is a rather nonsense concept in GR. If two events occur at times and places such that nothing could get from one to the other slower than the speed of light, there isn't really a correct answer as to which one of the events occured ""first"", or if they were simultaneous, though we can pick a inertial frame we like and ask which it learns of first."
0,This Dessert/Mesa transition is a perfect example of the great von Sway Style ;-)
0,"Etho! I'm curious about your editing process. When you're putting the video together, what are the first and last things you do editing-wise (i.e. not counting hitting the render button) and how do you like to structure the tracks in your editor?"
0,"You shouldn't destroy the well, it's important to preserve the history of your world, especially considering just how old it is. A slightly ""ugly"" world with history and character is far preferable to a smoothed over ""pretty"" world that's empty of quirks. That said, if you must, slightly moving or modifying the well would be a fine compromise, as it still holds that history even if its form is changed."
0,You have a desert city why not make a snowy city
0,GREAT EPISODE!
0,Keep all history!!!
0,You watched the Veratisium video about blue LED's as well!  ü§úü§õ Shared interest!
0,the reason why your world looks good is because it is not one theme.
0,"First time I don't know about an update in advance, I'm so surprised and I love all the new vegetation!"
1,what a gorgeous birch forest
0,"One thing you could do with a lot of your old and random builds is, turn them into historical sites/structures. Give them plaques with a bit of history."
0,"You asked about the well but also earlier about your slanted/curved smelter building. I‚Äôll just say when you first mentioned the building not fitting in I almost had a fit thinking you might possibly redo it and I LOVE it, personally. It‚Äôs iconic, it helps me navigate where in your world we are, and I think of it as a snapshot in time of your building prowess.

As for the well, it was a big ol‚Äô meh reaction. Hope that helps!

I always love exploring new updates with you especially as you look for naturally spawned new blocks. So happy you were able to find everything!! 

The firefly bushes are incredible! And they have a very good daytime application to show allergy season xD Pollen floating in the air!!"
0,do a custom mesa well in place of the desert well
0,"Redesign the well, maybe ruin it so it's looks ancient"
0,I watch Etho therefore I am
1,Don‚Äôt tell Etho that Bdubs‚Äô mountains are hollow
0,How did you get the llamas to walk around Sandy City like that?
0,"I don't think speed of light has a constant. It's just theoretical that IF there'd be nothing then light would travel at that distance.
Have you ever proved that there's NOTHING in any given place? I have! There's no basis for that theory! X D"
1,"I love the colors of the Mesa addition! Orange sandstone, maroon, dark gray, brown, and evergreen looks amazing together, especially next to the pale sand ‚ù§Ô∏è"
0,"I wonder if you could use a lot of the firefly bushes underneath a desert to create a sandstorm effect? They might not create enough particles, but with the redstone control option you could create small random wind gusts possibly, that could even roll across an area with time. I‚Äôve never used them so idk, but was a thought I had when seeing the particle effect."
0,Why not transform a couple of mountains to mesa instead of destroying the desert?
0,‚ù§
0,Oof I'd much prefer just desert
0,Unexpected Food Science mention hell yeah
0,I would move the well to the location where you felt it needs a build. That way your terraforming gets the feel it needs and that spot too.
1,buildings dont have to blend innnn blending in is so boring
1,"Overall, I like the terraforming, but it's just a little to busy/messy looking"

0,"Just learned about quantum calculators on my cyber security course, and I would say your assessment is very accurate :D
And definitely keep the well! It's a little piece of etho history. Maybe you could find some way to blend it into the surroundings?"
0,"Etho, your world does have a theme, its a theme of nostalgia and memories. While it does not match or blend it when you amass alot of that it becomes it own theme. I honestly love it, it reminds me of when i used play minecraft daily in high school. It has its own charm and i think most of the community will agree that makes its wonderful and beautiful."
0,my aunt and uncle areoving to canada! be nice to them up there hahah
0,Wow good job
0,"As someone who got killed by the well, I think it should stay! It could be moved a bit further back or even if there‚Äôs a little corner in Sandy City it could be tucked in nice to still be around, and trap people. Also a birch button instead may make it more effective as a trap"
0,"Does this break cactus farms?  Since the flowers don't pop off, eventually the classic cactus farm is going to have a flower on top of all of them, instead of growing a cactus to pop off?"

0,"You said we were going to do your favorite thing this episode.. then I proceeded to watch the episode til the end. I thought cooking with etho was your favorite thing ü§î

Keep the well, make it orange sand instead. Use the bushes under the corners to get the firefly effect.

Put leaves on the water in the well (if possible) do the leaves work on top of bubble columns. If so maybe a sneaky secret farm under the well to farm these new blocks and items"
0,"Keep the well in the world, but it doesn't need to stay where it is."
0,"9:30  absolutely shocked to see that etho could terraform this well . I'll be honest I kinda expected it to be not so good at the start but completely shocked me , more reason to never underestimate etho"

0,"I like the idea of a bit of mesa treatment at the edge of the desert....  but then I'd want to move the lava pond over there...  or maybe the well could go into the area you are thinking of making that little farm.  Removing the well would just feel wrong, but moving it would be okay.  Or perhaps the lava pit might work over there."
0,"When I was young, studying english, instead writing Desert, I wrote Dessert. The teacher was not impressed by that mistake."
0,i like worlds with no big theme way more. it‚Äôs more creative and interesting and innovative in my opinion and also very classic minecraft

0,"8:00 ish, I think the badlands area looks great! but it's uhh a bit over-decorated, relative to the surrounding area"
0,"Yea I never seen moss on water either but it does make me feel like we should do more with lakes. People treat them like swimming pools, flat plane of blue."
0,The count down to episode 600 is going strong
0,"You should keep the well and maybe make a little ‚Äútrader like outpost‚Äù a bit of straw/hay some trading tables and rest spots, mini stables 

Also I don‚Äôt think a theme is needed in all worlds especially one aslong as yours where everything would start blending in too much :)

And I really like the idea of blending things in by terraforming over changing or removing the structure, worst case move it or per possible add more similar stuff to the initial thing around it to make it look like it belongs more

I also really like how it all turned out it‚Äôs amazing

Also the fallen trees have been in bedrock for years mwhahahaha ;)
I also wanna add the firefly bushes under my enchantment table for e different mix of particles"
0,Don't you get rid of that well! I'm already devastated from the lava pool being removed..
0,Do not remove the desert well!
0,"Regards to keeping the well. I think you should keep it, but add your own flair to it and have it match the surroundings. Then it‚Äôs still there, but doesn‚Äôt stand out."
1,"I say keep the well! What's the point of the place being beautiful if we gotta tear down such funny history to make it so

Edit: Hey I'm in college trying to become quantum physics-adjacent (nuclear)! maybe someday i'll have a better answer for you, just a freshman right now, but for now I think quantum entanglement is like knowing that two packages have a pair of shoes between them. If you open one and see that it has a left shoe, you then instantly know that the other one must contain a right shoe, no matter how far you are from the package! Just swap the shoes for particle spins and stuff. This may seem pretty obvious, but i think the reason it's generally thought of as a weird spooky quantum thing is because the wavefunction for both particles seemingly collapses at the same time, since before you measure either one they are in a superposition, but after you know the state of both, meaning both wavefunctions had to have collapsed instantly across however far you are from the other ""shoe."" This probably isn't useful for breaking the speed of light since you can't really tell if a wave function's been collapsed from the outside or anything like that, so you can't send information instantly and thus don't violate General Relativity or go faster than the speed of light, but who knows, maybe someday we'll figure something out with it! I think we already use it for quantum computing coherence stuff, just not its ""faster than light"" stuff."
0,"Hey etho. I know we all have that getting started barrier creatively. You can try using AI tools for that, just take a screenshot of your world and ask the AI to fill in something just to get a bigger picture. No idea how good it works but hope you find it helpful."
0,I think the area you mention to have a structure in the new desert area to the left (30:39) should be a stable with some camels

0,see ya in a month
2,"I got so excited when you mentioned you like food science. I would love to hear more about some of your favorite concepts. My favorites are all about heat transfer; from sous vide, to resting meats, to sugar or salt content effecting boiling points and beyond. One of the coolest ones I learned from a combi oven demo was that they use steam injection to get a better ""fried food"" effect than a normal convection oven. It seems counter-intuitive because you would think water in the air would inhibit browning/crispy textures. What blew my mind is that this is only a factor if you allow condensation to occur. They cycle the air so efficiently that condensation is minimized, and the heat density of the air is way higher with a high humidity so its just quicker and more effective. So freaking cool."
0,"Hey Etho, I've been watching your videos for over 12 years! For half my life now these videos have entertained me, and brought a smile to my face when I was feeling down. I just want to say thank you. :)"
0,"im only at 15:57 where he's yippee-ing about it being placed on any block but i can't wait to see him realise (that unless this changed in the prereleases, in which case i will be mad) it ONLY needs a center block support - you can put them on fence bars and end rods and singular glass panes. this REALLY opens it up to being useful in loads of places, especially in water"

0,"The terraforming you did kind of reminds me of the area here in Moab! If you added some plateaus, arches, or even a canyon it'd look just like Arches National Park. Love your videos Etho!"
0,keep the well but decorate it!
0,"at the end I feel like that corner area would be perfect for a town bathing and laundry area, with a small pond. Been playing Kingdome Come Deliverance 2 and I immediately thought it felt like the small town laundry areas you go to around the map."

0,"I really appreciate how etho always encourages us to learn, probably my favorite thing about his videos"
0,"Etho, I want to hear about your thoughts on food science."
0,"not sure if it's intentional, but the red sand building makeover creates an abandoned building kinda vibe which seems very fitting given there's no functionality anymore"
0,Hi etho thanks for the upload ‚ù§
1,"Keep the desert well. It makes it feel like history of Minecraft, and your world, and it‚Äôs a bit of a call back to the old guard that remembers Minecraft before they came out, and how cool structures in the dessert first were"
0,Keep the well please!
0,"I'm totally impressed with your mesa Esque terraforming! also, keep the desert well!"
0,"I've been going through your entire let's play, and this video was particularly fun because I'm currently at the point where the pyramid and Sandy City are in its early stages. Very nice to see you still working on old projects and improving your world step by step!

However, don't say you haven't done some terraforming in your world! The biome enhancement project has made your world so much nicer already. I do look forward to seeing what your new skills in terraforming do to your world. It's at least off to a great start :)"
0,"I must admit, I ABSOLUTELY fell for all the traps in your world downloads back in the day. I totally forgot about them until you brought it up lol"
0,Honestly the mesa-fication turned out way better than I thought it would. I think the red may be a bit unnecessary but you blended it all well.
0,"On a different note, this was one of my favorite episodes in a while. Spending a lot of time learning the mechanics of a new feature reminded me a lot of the old days when you'd dedicate time to that every time there was an update. That's why I fell in love with this series - very fun!"
0,You have to keep the well. It killed me once. The way my jaw was on the floor..
1,"First thought when I saw the reveal, after you showed the wall, and befofe you got any of the update stuff‚Ä¶ I straight up said wow, that looks really good! Cause it does!! Good job etho!"
0,"Now that you‚Äôve mentioned it, I think the next world download should definitely include a novel way to kill the player :)"
0,"I think the new area is a little bit too cluttered, at least when it's directly next to the very plain sand. I think if you extend the mesa-like section across that whole area and up to the wall it'll help a lot to make it not stick out so badly. Alternatively, tone down the vegetation along the transition a bit I think"
0,Good to know Etho is a Veritasium enjoyer also.
0,"Etho, you should consider making a custom Ponderosa forest to help blend your mesa, desert, and forest. 
I worked as a backpacking guide in the badlands of the southwest US and ponderosa pine forests were definitely my favorite part. A healthy ponderosa forest should allow people to ride a horse full gallop through it and it smells like butterscotch, would be a cool thing to represent."
1,#Etho keep the well!!
0,"Etho and Bdubs and Scar uploads, all on the same day? Wahoo!

Nice plan for the day, taking a break to spruce things up... And ohhh, I'm so glad you didn't take that converter building down heh... Not only does it look so cool (I mean, I think so anyway!) but it's part of the history of the world, and idk, there's something comforting and orienting about keeping those things around. So I guess re the Well, I'd vote to keep it too, but I also think it's fine to fancy up an old structure or change some blocks... It just becomes more layers of history :) As a viewer I quite like being able to look at a thing and remember how it came to be and the changes it's gone through. (That all said, it is *your* creative space, and ultimately I'd rather you do whatever makes you happy!)

I love the way you're branching out with your terraforming and so on, trying out new things etc. And that mesa-esque biome looks awesome, it'll be cool to see it spread out some more! I do agree that the dry grass'll look better with it being in patches vs evenly scattered. And I had the same thought about dry leaves being blown up against walls! It's so great, the things they're giving us to work with.

Thanks for the episode! Now how to go about fixing my massive cactus-powered XP factory... Maybe it's just a part of history now, haha x)"
1,"I like you keeping old builds even if they're non functional or kinda ugly by today's standards. I think if you don't want the trap well in its current spot, i think moving it to the spot at 30:42 could be nice. Also I think it would be cool to add little landmark signs like you see in real life on preserved buildings that explain the original purpose of the building or structure, could be fun to make some dramatized explanations for old builds. For the sand converter something like ""we believe this ancient monument was built by an alchemist, who in his time believed it possible to transmute sand between its different forms"" you could also have a small simplified example build of the mechanism showing like ""yellow sand + piston = red sand"" in a pictrographic way."

0,"i'd be fine with you tearing down the desert well personally. while i get wanting to hold onto for history, given that it was mainly made for a joke i think it's fine to let it go. i'm sure that it got some people back when you added it, and so it can be said that it served it's purpose. art is ephemeral, not permanent!"
0,"For the sandstone well, if you aren't opposed to just a small retouch, make the blocks more like the red sandstone area behind it. I think that would be the best option. Keep some sandstone to keep the original style but add some red sandstone/sand as a small accent. Then you keep the deathtrap AND help further tie in the sandy village to the red ex sand farm :) that would be my vote BUT if that's too much then just keep the sandstone well as is :)"
0,"9:17 as a southern california local, this little desert revamp really feels really realistic to me. i mean most deserts have a hell of a lot more life in them than the typical barren waste you see in a lot of pop culture. this little path absolutely feels like somewhere i'd go hiking"
0,"Hey Etho, Just a thought but why not move the well into the corner instead of building a farm for the new grass?

Grass farm may be more useful but visually the well might look better there while still being preserved"
0,"So are classic cactus farms broken now? If a flower grows before a two tall, the farm just fizzles out?"
0,"Hiya Etho! I like the new items for biomes. I want to thank you for encouraging everyone to continue self education too! Maybe surprise everyone with adding a new suprise well? It's a pleasure to enjoy this series, thank you! <3 ~respect"
0,"I think it'd be super neat if you could compost those new dry grasses into sand blocks so you can make big sand farms, maybe then we would get rid of tnt dupers?"
0,"I think you should keep the well, but maybe move it over to that corner of the wall that you said needed a structure. that way you keep the history of the world but it doesn't distract from the terrain."
0,"First and foremost, YAY! Efo has uploaded! Second, I think your terraforming skills are coming along great! You'll be teaching Bdubs how to do it in no time."
0,"Hey Etho, long time viewer first time commenter. I was wondering if when you made Sandy City did you think that it would continue to spark creativity for you so many years later."
0,"I think the desert well can go. You're right it won't fit into the area. You could try moving it somewhere else too. 

I cannot wait to see what you do with the new update! These decorative blocks are a game changer! I hope they add green and fall colored leaf piles with their respective seasonal updates."
0,I‚Äôm studying Ontology on YouTube and it is the most difficult thing in the world.

0,"If you don't like the well, take it out, its your world first, then ours :) but if you need a structure in the other area, you could also just relocate the well over there."
0,I feel like we need a museum for old builds or just random buildings that have to get demolished for one reason or another. That way you don't have to feel bad getting rid of something that doesn't fit anymore

1,hey Etho! I have been on the search for Etho  merch for a long time now. ive been watching you for 10 or more years now and would love to get something to put on a car or water bottle. Do you ever want to make your own merch? and does it bother you that other people sell stuff of your likeness?
1,"Quantum physics gets really bad in popular media because it simultaneously has a lot of really crazy results that are mind blowing, but is also _really_ hard to understand. So scientists will give shortened explanations, and then ppl will just spread the shortened explanation like wildfire and then nothing makes any sense.

Also, one of my favorite QM misconceptions: people often explain superposition using schrodinger's cat.... when schrodinger's cat was literally thought up as a thought experiment to demonstrate how crazy the results of QM were. (ofc, superposition really is a thing that makes sense within QM, but it's just genuinely something that takes a lot to wrap your head around)"
2,"2:00 dont blend everything to ""fit"", also 11:20 KEEP THE WELL
The history of it is cool in of itself because its been there forever, but also one of hte unique things here is that there are parts reminiscent of older minecraft styles. one of hte big separators between your world and most others IS that you have all this history with old builds; no matter how much ""objectively"" better it would be to smooth everything out to flow easier, its a style in of itself to have a sort of ""jumble"" of builds to a degree (every youtuber has a dozen giant fancy builds/areas in their worlds, so its not necessarily that interesting to see another world full of nothing but that same style)"
1,"Of course they had a ""fast turnaround"" on the spring drop.  90% of it was already out before the Minecraft Misnomer came out, so what would possibly have taken much time?

12,"Hey Ergo, I just wanted to say that I started watching you in middle school and I am now a Quantum Physicist, the wave function can collapse when looking at of of the entangled states and then it ""instantly"" collapses the other, But the important thing here is that the information is not traveling faster than the speed of light because the information of what state the first entangled particle is would need to travel to the location of the second to be of any use and thus must travel though a classical channel and travel at the speed of light¬†

If you have a pair of gloves and put them in two boxes and then move the boxes far apart. Open one box and see you have the left glove that must mean the right glove is in the other box ""instantly"" however to tell the person that they have the right glove you would need to tell them though ways that must be slower than the speed of light  Notes: the gloves are predetermined when you put them in the box and not actually in a superposition state, but its just a close analogy"

I'll say it would definitely be possible to blend things a bit together, as in that they don't randomly appear like they do there. But honestly speaking, I watch you now for...13 years? I only recall someone mentioned on Monkeyfarms video that him and you were the best builders. I checked you out, didn't like there is no texture pack and left, but some video caught my eye (I think it was Episode 110 where you build a cow fishing farm and yes I extra looked that up now). Rambling aside, one thing that has been consistent is that nothing feels too tied together. Like yes, the things have a use, even if the use is just looks or having fun, but since they aren't that connected it feels like a new adventure when something new is build. If there was only the man cave then yea it'd be still a ton of fun to expand and change it, but a new farm attached to it would also just be another part in the big cave. One of my favorite buildings were the amplified mountain village and the episode where IIRC you exploded all of it with TNT. This is so random but also just felt like visiting a new dimension within the same world.
So yea, I do get the complaint about it when building now, it probably feels a bit limiting and no matter how good it looks, there is something in the back sticking out, but it gives a unique feeling to the let's play."
4,"I really like that terraforming palette! I also love that there are desert plants in the mix (the mangrove stuff)¬†
The leaf litters are kinda satisfying. Like the cherry flowers, I just throw a bunch on the ground without planning anything and it makes everything feel better somehow.
Update: ok, the firefly bush is my new favorite thing now."
2,It looks amazing ego!
1,I want to now what ethos thoughts on what mumbo  is doimg with fans...  there so cool.  Id love to see a etho take on it
1,I wonder if you could have a cactus block on a sticky piston and then a detector for when the flower grows. Retract the piston with the cactus block on it to pop off the flower and put it back again. It's also been a decade since I've played the game so no idea if that would work or not.
1,Did you mean to write 1.21.5 in the description?
1,"I don't keep up to date with the minecraft updates, so I saw this video and thought ""Oooh, new Etho vid- wait, the what?""
Guess I gotta go boot up my pc lol"
1,Never destroy a build
2,"Thank goodness, i needed some etho time today. Its been such a rough day, just need some time to relax"
1,Great video as always Etho!
1,i love your work and sharing your persona with anecdotes and creativity
1,How did you get the llamas to stop walking around sandy city?
1,"These are my favorite types of vides of Etho's just watching him decroate and experiment. discuss his thoughts, im no good at redstone so its lovely to see him improve things and chat!"
1,Decorate the well!!!!
1,I wonder if your old recreated cactus farm is producing any cactus flowers already
1,etho...its time...new world...come on man.
1,"So I say remove the desert well, you built it so you can move it if necessary. Also it sorta gets in the way with the new terraforming."
1,dont think i liked the mesa. Its too over reaching. I liked the simple and plain the yellow desert
1,Don‚Äôt tear down the well :)
1,Should add layers of terracotta to the hill behind the building like a badlands biome
1,Dr. Becky Smethurst is always a good watch.
1,Wow!  Really like the mesa and desert blending!
1,With the random plants I would make a path through them where there are not plants. Either a foot path or an animal path. You may even put some sand stone down in places if you want it to look well used and trodden.
1,Keep the well on the far side from the sand building add the floor design from a desert pyramid
1,The description says 1.21.1 instead of 1.21.5 üôÉ
1,"1.21.5 made several changes to bubble columns. I think the fix of bug MC-261385 caused the villagers to get stuck. This fixed a bug that made bubble columns with nonsolid blocks above them (such as a fence gate) not launch entities as fast. So you were right, that bubble column is pushing the villagers up more than before."
1,"What if the desert well was transformed into a bit of a ruin, as if we pressed the button üòÅ"
2,So close to episode 600! Maybe we'll get it before 2030 üòÅ
2,"Man I have been watching etho‚Äôs lets play world for so long that I will be going to college before this series ends

Thank you for being my childhood Etho"
1,34:47 did Etho just say quantum mcphysics? Is he perhaps a fellow Philomena Cunk enjoyer?
1,etho are you gonna watch the minecraft movie!
1,The orange sandstone area gives me boarderlands vibes
2,Etho! The moss carpet on water isn't unique to moss. You can do it with all carpets!
1,The blue led video is probably the one that Veritasium made. That channel and Cool Worlds are two that I can easily recommend!
1,"I think the old desert well needs to move, but shouldn‚Äôt be forgotten. Maybe it can have a second life as the skin of your desert grass farm"
1,34:23 That was one of the first videos I ever watched from Veritasium. I've been hooked ever since!
4,"In love with the mesa, I love that the layers look like rock strata. I think the walls between biomes make the desert look sort of man-made. What I would do is make the new mesa branch off into the transition, and keep that theme consistent around the perimeter of the desert on that side. So just put tuff, red clay etc. in the ground, perhaps in the same vertical sequence to keep within geological parameters."
1,"The terraforming looks so nice! I actually love Red Sand and Red Sandstone, so I really enjoyed seeing it used."
2,"The bushes could make a great environment for a snow village. Perpetual soft falling snow. Love the watermelon cacti, definitely stealing that one for my world. Thanks!"
1,i wonder what foodscience say about onions :D
1,"Hello Etho! I was wondering what (kinds of) videos do you watch in the background whilst you're building?

P.S. You gotta keep the desert well. I fell for your trap many years ago."
1,For the desert well you should relocate it
1,"Etho, are the llamas still walking around the sandy city? The people need to know"
1,"Keep the well 100%. that being said, i do agree it looks really odd in its position, and its so small, id honestly just move it to another part of the desert. maybe in the middle of the sugar cane farm? Idk, i do think it should stay somewhere though. Those red sand cliffs look amazing too, it may be worth the effort to expand the area it covers even more too. it looks that good, my biggest problem with red sand is so few pallets blend well with it, resorting to almost exclusively high contrast builds. but here it works amazing."
1,keep the well
1,DONT TOUCH THE WELL
1,I think it wouldn‚Äôt really be removing the history if you kept the well but just moved it to a better location. That just becomes part of the new history
1,Your desert area looks so good! Your terraforming mixed with the new plants makes it so immersive
30,"I think ""It might be too chaotic, I""m not sure"" is *exactly* where you want your nature builds to be. absolutely gorgeous detailing and great variety but structured just enough to flow together without feeling artificial"
0,The leaves kinda look like foot steps a bit
0,I watched the same blue LED video I think. My favorite part is that red + green + blue light = white!  RGB!  If you mix those in paint you get vomit.
0,"Ok so now that we‚Äôre no longer fishing all the time, I see terraforming is the new subject to learn. Excellent because mine sucks and maybe I can actually learn something. 

Always makes my day when I see a new upload. And a BDubs today too? Sweet!"
1,I love stuff shown off at 8:00. Keep the well!
2,19:02 I see what you're laying down.
2,"Hey Etho I just wanted to drop a comment to say thank you. I‚Äôve been watching for maybe a little over 10 years now and you‚Äôre always someone I can watch to just relax and take a break, so thank you again."
1,"Hey Etho, do you like candy corn? I love it, but some of my friends think it's nasty. Surely they're wrong?"
2,"1:46 If anyone tells you that it is ""unfortunate"" that your world does not have one unifying theme, I think they're being a bit toxic. Minecraft is a game about expressing yourself! If that means building the perfect fantasy world where everything fits perfectly together, then that's great! But to me, I'd find that a bit alienating from the way that I enjoy the game."
1,Brother you started Sandy City 10 YEARS AGO! EPISODE 389 WDYM LETS FINISH IT BEFORE EPISODE 600
1,"So you can actually put the cactus flower on bamboo, but only if the bamboo position happens to be close enough to center. I did some testing -- check my comment on the r/minecraft post ""**Uncommon d√©cor combo due to bamboo being randomly offset. Only a centered cane allows you to place Cactus Flower atop**"" -- and it's about 1.55% of all possible bamboo positions globally"
1,etho do you watch adam ragusea?
1,11:09 that well have killed me before... üòÇ
24,"Hey Etho, how did you get the llamas to walk around sandy city without them wandering off?"
1,"Love the episode, Etho"
1,Maybe you could move the lava well to that spot at 30:38
2,I watched the video on the blue LED a few months ago! Such a shame that he never got the credit he deserved after putting so much work into finding the solution. Building your own machines to create something you don't know is possible is a lot of work!
2,"Didn't throw diamonds in the lava before removing it.... I'm not angry, just disappointed."
2,10:51 I definitely agree that the well should stay but it could be improved with some decoration. It might be neat to copy over some of the dark prismarine from the other build or make it look old and overgrown.
1,Please do another world tour on episode 600
1,Sometime building should be outstanding from other to make feeling that it is real.
1,"Man going around Sandy City the desert area is really shaping up. But I'm gonna be honest, I can't focus on it cause I'm too busy wondering how he got the llamas to walk around like that!"
1,"Oh, no, Etho is turning into a modern builder!"
1,Sandy city is my favorite project in this world.
1,the mini mesa biome looks amazing! i love the details and block choices!
2,Please don‚Äôt tear down the well.
3,I see Etho is as punctual with his Veritasium videos as he is with his finishing his Hermitcraft projects
1,"love the terraforming, but all the plant life feels a bit too cluttered. you may want to get rid of some of them. loved the episode!"
1,You need to build on those old mountains mr Etho!
1,keep it but blend the colors
0,"Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is cannibalism"
1,"I think you should give the desert well a visual overhaul. It doesn't need a big structural change, just a bit more variety in block-choice."
0,I can't unsee the leaf litter on sand as a kitty litter box
1,"moving the well to where you said might need a structure near the end of the video could be a good idea, to remove it from where it's ugly but keep it still."
0,so casually Ehto made an quantum cactus solver machine
0,I don‚Äôt think the well makes the area ugly - I think a big appeal of lets plays like this is the history of the world and all the little things like that well that make it unique
0,Move the well to another location using the exact same blocks
0,Plz don't get rid of the jungle trees next to the pyramid.
0,"Keep the well, those memories are important! :) I agree with the other commenters though, find a way to blend it into the immediate environment? Or even better, maybe make your own version, and then edit the old well to look a little more decrepit/aged?"
0,"Everytime i watch an Etho video it just reminds me how hes definitely Canadian bc he talks like a Canadian, because he talks like my dad, and my dad is Canadian, farm raised and all, its a bit surreal lol"
0,Interesting comment of the day woo
0,"From what I've heard, if you think you understand quantum physics, you probably don't really. Also really hoping you find some of the new animal variants at some point. I forget, did you ever find an ancient city?"
0,Love the red sand additions!! So vibrant
0,I've been watching your videos for over 10 years and it's still one of the most exciting and relaxing things to see a new release from you
0,i missed you etho a lot
0,Those mountains by sandy city are my favorite type of terrain that MC ever had!
0,its instant.  there is no travel as they are `connected`
0,"I say keep the well, maybe spruce it up or even run it down like an old unused well that the town just leaves and maybe fences off rather than removes"
48,"Its nice to know that I'm not alone with obsessively researching random subjects and watching science Youtube for entertainment. I've gotten deep into so many miscellaneous subjects completely be accident. You never know when some obscure bit of knowledge will prove useful, and even if it doesn't its just so fun to be able to observe natural phenomena and understand what is going on. I also love all the obscure plant knowledge like cacti being edible (though do watch out for oxalate crystals, not all cacti are worth snacking on), its so nice to know that Etho actually appreciates botany, its super underrated."
0,üòä I love the new badlands terrain. It looks awesome!
0,"For those mountains near your base- would you ever want to add a little NPC style village? with little snowy houses, shops, and other things? I know it's more for decoration than function, so not sure if it's your style"
0,"there's a video that i think you might enjoy, ""Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists"" by Microsoft. i found it super interesting, being a programmer myself."
0,Pre-comment prediction: he‚Äôs gonna say many worlds is his favorite interpretation.
0,Keep that well Etho!
0,Omg its a bush? Keralis must be losing it lmfao
0,My YouTube runs at 480p (cause my internet is bad). But! that makes the transition between the yellow and red sand look really cool.
0,yessssss
0,The cactus and cactus flower launching across the desert had me laugh out loud. Something about it was just so comedic
0,Keep the well but maybe move it a little bit to be more of a centerpiece. Maybe even add some flourish around it?
0,"The cactus flower on a lightning rod looks like a feather duster. Could go in like a supply closet, would make a nice detail"
0,"You should keep the well, it's too iconic to be demolished"
0,"obvs keep the well, thanks ergo <3"
0,"Please please pleeeese keep the well!
It's too nostalgic for you to remove.
That and Spaz's house killed me. üòÜ"
0,"i thought fallen trees have been a thing, i definitely remember them in some of my worlds throughout the years. were they bedrock only or something? weird, but theyre so cool!"
1,The well's well
0,"I'd say get rid of the well, it just doesn't fit there anymore. It obscures the view and it's too bright when it's dark out. The argument it's history and been there for years goes for every block, you haven't touched, out there."
1,Get ur snax
0,The contrast between the sand and the forest is natural. Don't forget about the Athabaska sand dunes.
0,"Loved your take on quantum physics! I totally agree with what you said and think a lot of what gets spread around is the stuff that seems interesting and not necessarily what is true. Everyone wants to have their perception of the world shattered by something seemingly impossible but I think the physics of the KNOWN universe are crazy enough for a hundred lifetimes. I still am excited about the research and don't think it should stop, but I don't see teleporters or anything else coming out of it. It will probably just help us better understand what we already know and to do it better and more efficiently."
0,That red desert is beautiful
0,you would do well to keep it
0,Do not remove the well!
0,17:47 WHAT???
0,maybe move the well slightly but defintely dont get rid of it
207,11:00 the well is here to stay! There needs to be some relics of the past.
0,Make a tribute to the desert well. A spiritual successor that‚Äôs better
0,I'd make the well into a ruin itself so that it keeps some record of it once being there but gets transformed into something that fits in well (no pun intended).
1,"I just thought of something. Dessert have fatamorgana right? I think its possible to make that using shulker? Like maybe water or blue glass, and cover it with sandy colored shulker so from afar it looks like water, but once you get close it's just landüòÆ but I don't know if there's sand colored shulker"
0,You must like Technology Connections.
0,"I think the corner at 30:40 would be an excellent space for some camels to rest. Its a little closed off by terrain, its outside of the main city (where they are usually held) and a River is close by. That‚Äòd be optimal"
0,"Thank you for your videos. I've been feeling like YouTube is no longer as good as it used to be, it's nice to have a channel that's just good content without clickbait."
1,"man etho, i started watching you when you started the man-cave and i gotta say, you dont need to copy the status quo and make everything uniform or purposeful. things can be spur of the moment and fun. it was your unique style and approach to things that drew me in all those years ago. dont conform, be you"
0,GET THE POPCORN ITS ETHO TIME RAHHHH
0,Love me a polishing video with tips and tricks by the Master! Promoting education is much appreciated. Something our society needs more of. Thx! A credible source is crucial to objective learning and the ability to ask reasoned questions.‚ù§
1388,"Etho, don't fall prey to the modern Youtube tendencies of optimizing your content to be just aesthetically ideal and focused on showing results. We like the quirkiness of your world and how you build things, and it would be sad to lose that just for the sake of slightly better looking builds and quick gratification. There are a million other channels that do that. I've noticed you ever so slightly trending in this direction, so I just want to go out there and say, stick to your roots! Your style is a rare gem on Youtube these days."
0,"I would move the well to the corner where you want to add a structure, keep the history of the structure and clear out the main desert at the same time."
0,Leave the desert well
0,how about using a little bit of orange concrete powder to soften the red sand a bit?
0,"Would you be able to salvage the well by making it worn to time, overgrown with plant life and broken down"
1,"Etho, 
I have been watching for years and have a question because I remember you enjoyed Tera Firma Craft. Would you ever try Vintage Story? It is very similar to that old mod, but has its own challenges to it."
0,Dry grass plus Haybales would be amazing
0,Would stripped oak/birch help blend between the tuff/dirt and the original sand?
0,"hey sandy-city!

How did you make the Etho go around the Llama like that? 

(this joke is sooooooo old..)"
0,"To fill in those mountains, why don't you try building a Dwarvish city/keep? Its right up your alley (I know this concept was tested in Hermitcraft season 3...) and would look super cool and thematic. Plus, no need to build too many roofs!"
0,The Firefly effects remind me of the Twilight Forest Mod
0,I personally think you should either get rid of or move the well to inside sandy city. Sometimes we like to keep onto things for the memory even though we don‚Äôt actually look after or appreciate them any more. At that point it‚Äôs better to move on and make good use of the space.
0,And a let‚Äôs play episode at that ü•≤
0,"Ehi Etho, have you ever thought about pruning your world from far away chunks you don't explore often? Since chunk borders are no longer an issue?"
0,Eeeeethoooooo!!!! Thank you!!! What a present surprise I was really not expecting an upload!!
0,Keep the desert well! I think the desert grass helps blend the structure in better.
0,I'd say leave the well.
0,"In relation to the comment of the day, you should check out the 99% invisible podcast. Every time I listen to them I‚Äôm so fascinated. I listened to one recently where they talk about cargo ships that are abandoned by their company due to high port costs. The problem is that they then won‚Äôt pay the cargo ships crew if they leave the ship, forcing them to stay on board for months or years until the issue is resolved."
0,"Hey etho, how'd you get the llamas to walk around Sandy City (tm) like that?"
0,I think you should just built a new lava fountain but in your own style honors the past but looks nice
0,I really like the sea pickles as barrel cactus and really enjoyed this episode.
0,"Yeah boys, we're on the final stretch for the next world tour. Looking forward to seeing that cactus flower farm."
0,"Etho, could you talk a bit about your thoughts on starting a new world? What would make you want to, do you think you ever will?"
0,Found out my wife was pregnant this morning and Etho uploads a video! What an amazing day today has been
0,"I'd say keep the well, but you can shrink it using thinner blocks while also keeping the killing function intact"
0,"As a physics major... quantum mechanics is definitely very theory based and the class I took on it was very much about the math. The only thing that can be shown from QM is the double slit experiment. Everything else in class was largely based on the mathematics and calculus II and III (integration and multivariable calculus). It's a cliche to say it, but if you think you understand QM you probably don't."
0,"Hi Etho! I think it's cool how a lot of biomes around your main area are close together. A theme that you could go for is containing the different biomes in certain areas (maybe the mountains could be made taller which could also be a good way to learn terraforming).
Kind of like Terraria where you have to contain the crimson or corruption from spreading. You could experiment with different biome blending techniques and such!"
0,Can‚Äôt believe that didn‚Äôt end with a sponsorship for Brilliant üòÇ
0,"Teetho, how did you get the [Tall Desert Grass] to grow around Sandy City like that?"
1,"Imagine the implications of toggle able fireflys for farm interfaces and mini games 
Its going to be really fun to use"
1,"I currently do research in physics but my field isn't quantum information (which is what covers quantum entanglement). My understanding of entanglement is that the entangled objects should be considered as parts of a larger object, like the two sides of a coin. If you look at one side of a coin, you immediately know what's on the other side, and it's the same for entangled things. If you look at one half of the entanglement (‚âà a side of a coin), you will immediately know what's the other half is. (Although all this is complicated by the fact that entangled systems are like the quantum version of a coin, which, from the perspective of someone doing this experiment, would show up as different results even if the set-up is entirely identical.)

I think the reason you've been hearing that information is transmitted at light speed is that the particles used in examples of entanglement are often photons (light particles), which move at the speed of light, and the information is transmitted when the photons are sent out. But as another commenter said, no information is transmitted when you look at your entangled half, even though you immediately know what the other half now is.

Hopefully this was coherent enough. As xkcd #2501 shows, sometimes you forget that the average person only knows the chemical formulas for olivine and one or two feldspars. üòÖ"
0,The firefly bushes are so beautiful!!
0,I never would of thought of some of the building tricks youre using with the new block
0,Please leave the well. It‚Äôs got a personality.
0,Love revisiting this
0,I like that you are trying terraforming. It makes such a big difference and you need a lot of material so you need good farms :)
0,Keep the classic well! A piece of history! üòä‚ù§
0,"Oh, I need to check the update for myself now! For the well, I say keep it but transform it into something a bit more interesting."
0,"30:38 I think a hotspring or something would look cool over there, out of the way for privacy"
0,None of my worlds have ever had a particular theme. It‚Äôs just I thought that looked cool so I‚Äôm gonna put it there. I like the kinda just running with it idea.
0,Lets Gooooooooo Ergo is back!!
0,You can bone meal the grass in birch biomes and get the wildflowers that way. You don't have to find them.
0,"I vote bulldoze the well. üôÇ Love your Minecraft videos Etho, and the fact you always stay you."
0,"Absolutely love the wild mesa transition with all the shrubbery, with red sandstone outcrops, reminds me of Sedona, AZ. 
Oh man, the firefly bush is so cool, and the sandy sounds too. It is a great update for sure."
0,"That 1 block cacti can grow the flowers seems to break all the normal cactus farms. You gotta do observer/piston ones now, since the ""pop it off with a sign"" ones will now all eventually get stuck with flowers on every cactus."
2,"Etho, I thought of a new series. Kicking back to old school gaming videos on YT. A voice over chat while the gameplay is going. You have a ‚ÄúSimple Knowledge with Etho‚Äù series that you talk about something you learned, site your sources for others to dive into it. Kids really look up to you, you help them get excited about learning more things outside of school, I think that could really help."
1,8:03 I like the red sandstone! It goes really well with all of the different types of greenery.
1,"Hello Etho, I have trouble sleeping at night so I often listen to your videos to go to sleep that's helps me out , I was wondering if you are ever interested in dropping them as podcasts on like Spotify as some video podcasters do, love your videos."
0,"I think they should make the leaves place based off of cursor position instead of player position. That way you don‚Äôt have to spin around so much, especially when playing a lot of them."
0,Move the well to the other side of the path with the little clearing
1003,"For years I wondered why all of the wells I found contained water, never lava. Today I learned desert wells never actually generated with lava, that was just Etho being Etho."
0,"9 ep left till 600, gotta fix up the place for the 600 world download.

no pressure xD"
0,üòé
0,I think i saw the same LED video you watched. Fascinating
41,"1.21.5 has made worlds feel so much more natural. The particle effects, the dried leaves everywhere, the fallen trees!! its all incredible"
1,Idea: Keep the well but you could upgrade it with the underground fireflies to make a wishing well (using skulk sensor to detect item burning)
0,"A lot has changed since this world was created. With all these mechanical game changes are you ever tempted, or have thought about, starting a new world?"
0,great video etho! the terraforming looks lovely
0,"Re: ""quantum physics is very theoretical and it's hard to show and prove its results"" 

On the contrary! Quantum physics predicts essentially every observed phenomenon at the atomic and subatomic levels - energy levels in atoms, the behaviors of semiconductors (which underlie CPUs, SSDs, LEDs, and much more), lasers, simple chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, superconductors, polarization of light, thermal radiation, blah blah blah. The main difficulty is that it's often very far removed from typical human experience: we never ""see"" individual atoms behaving certain ways, we don't directly interface with quantum phenomena often (notable exceptions being sunlight, LEDs (most modern light bulbs), fire, computers, lasers)"
1,"Hey Etho. Your terraforming is looking great. You are right, the well doesn‚Äôt go well with the new terraforming. Pun intended. The fallen trees also grow mushrooms. It looks really cool. Thanks for the video as always. Also one day I would love for you to ride one of my Minecraft roller-coasters. Thanks for inspiring me to create them."
0,I‚Äôve played wiiu mc since 2020 and there have always been fallen trees with stumps.  Fyi
0,"Hello Etho, you may have answered this before but what kind of videos do you listen to in the background while building? Good job on the terraforming, you've improved a lot!"
16,"I really love the ""overgrown vegetation around the abandoned building"" vibe. I think it's very fitting!"
0,"this update also changed the ender pearl chunk loader once more, now not only ender pearls load chunks but they also do random ticks, so any farm that needs a player nearby just to do random ticks can use enderpearls instead, things like copper oxidizing or crops growing"
0,Definitely put the fireflies in the swamp / mushroom house area to make it more mystical
0,"34:35 science fan I see, I‚Äôd recommend the channel StyroPyro. I remember you mentioned how you would make fireworks and stuff like that as a kid, he does that but taken to eleven. Lots of chemistry stuff, lots of electronics stuff, I think you‚Äôd enjoy his content"
0,Elbows up üá®üá¶
0,can you just move the well elsewhere?
0,"Etho, the leaves also look like footsteps! (Maybe something for your trails/tunnels)"
1,"Loved the texturing jobs! Personally I love the orange of the orange sandstone but the textures and plants variation made it soooo much better.
Had no idea about the moss carpets! Nice! I was disappointed that the cactus flower didn't go on lily pads tho.
Thanks! Was fun to watch!"
0,Hoho we get treated nice ‚ù§
0,34:17 Etho watches Veritasium videos!
2,"Wow, awesome. I can't wait to see the hermits reactions to these updates."
0,We may be descending into facism but at least I can rely on etho
1,"the dopamine levels my brain reaches when Etho uploads is unimaginable. Great episode as always, thank you Etho!"
1,Personally I think you should keep the well and try to make it blend in. You never cease to amaze with your building and creativity. Thanks Etho I've got just the snacks for this one
0,Bro I was just about to go to sleep and then I see there‚Äôs a new Etho video‚Ä¶üòÇ
0,Move the well to the corner you were talking about needing a structure at toward the end of the video. Feels like a good compromise
0,I vote keep the well but move it out of the way.
1,How did Etho get the plants to grow around Sandy City like that?!
0,Completly unexpected! Etho likes an update with lots of plants! ;)
3,Went out last with some friends for my birthday (which is today) and now having a relaxing day with a nice upload treat. Thanks for being my go to for comfort content throughout the years ‚ù§
0,the terraforming looks great
0,You should reconstruct the desert well! I bet it would look cool with a little upgrade
0,"Definitely keep the well, but I think moving it about 20 blocks away from the red sand building might give it the space for it to breathe and fit in."
35,"7:48 as someone who has been to Zion and Bryce national parks, it reminds me a lot of some of the more secluded areas of the parks. It works great and isn‚Äôt too busy!"
0,What food science channels do you watch?
0,"35:00 yeah the thing is, noone really understands quantum physics. Everyone is just half guessing, some people are just better at the guessing part. You know, the physics professor opening the first lecture with ""right now I'm the only one who doesnt understand quantum physics. In a couple of weeks you won't understand quantum physics either"""
0,"Etho, I say move the lava well to the corner where you said you would maybe build a structure at 30:40. No, it‚Äôs not the original, but I think moving it would be better than getting rid of it altogether.

Also, you‚Äôre such a G"
0,"I like the well, might need blending in a little, but I think it adds a point of interest in that little dip.
I really like how you did the terraforming there, it looks like rock formations sticking out of the desert, or like sand has been blown into the area from further out in the desert. The plants and leaf litter really add some life to it too.  Mojang did a really good job with this update!"
0,I miss etho playing modded üò≠ can't believe terrafirmacraft was 10 years ago
0,That is really really convincing rough scrubland terrain!! I love it
0,"Etho, your thumbnail-less videos will forever be famous
But seriously it's pretty interesting how even without a ""proper"" thumbnail, and even if no characters are in the scene, something about the style of the chosen moment still makes it immediately recognizable to me as an etho video!"
0,"17:55 this was a realization for me too. I was making a guardian farm and accidentally pushed my carpets onto the water. It‚Äôs not just moss, normal carpets work too"
0,No need to be clingy with every sentimental build in the world. If it directly disrupts a new vision or project then it‚Äôs okay to remove it.
0,"for me, Etho videos are drop-everthing-and-watch videos"
40,"That veritaseum video on blue LEDs has to be my favourite on his channel! I showed my housemates the video and they were completely engrossed, it's a really good story"
1,How did you get that texture for the sandstone? I thought it was smooth on top? (slabs?)
0,I think the new minecart changes would be perfect for a mountain rollercoaster...
0,Etho play some Vintage Story its like terrafirma craft but its own minecraft style game
0,Keep the well! It's got the same nostalgic chaos of a Super Mario 64 level.
0,"i really love how the terraforming turned out. who would have thought that using tuff, wood, terracotta, and orange sand would look good together? not me! they really work well in the area you put them in. the practice you put in terraforming is really showing because the work you did on the desert looks amazing. if this is only practicing, im absolutely looking forward to what you can do in the future.

i think that the well should stay, you can make the random positioning make sense by adding ruins around the area :)

love the video! the quiet building transition in between clips is so satisfying."
0,ethooo :D
0,that blue led video was amazing i watched that a few weeks ago too
0,You could move the desert well over to that corner where you wanted that grass farm structure to be
0,eto!!!!!!!
0,Keep the well. I personally dont like when you remove old stuff - but the new terrain is looking nice
0,Ethowo~ ü§ç
0,"It's crazy Etho plays minecraft for a living and plays on a 1080 monitor with a 2060! Pretty cool imo haha

also 27:33"
1,Im probably in the minority but the desert well needs to go.  Its just fit with work youve done in the desert.  Maybe if the desert was bigger id say keep it but that desert is too small for a well that big.
0,"A food fact. Cooking works by denaturing proteins. Sanitizers also work the same way, denaturing the proteins in bacteria cell walls. But this means you could take a steak, and ""sear"" a stake with sanitizer in the right concentrations and it would be a room temp stake! Isn't that awful? Also, my daughter says to keep the well."
0,"Veritasium recently kept a mind breaking video on quantum physics, and I study physics at a graduate level and its still mind blowing!"
0,"Do you have any specific science topic channels you like, or do you just choose them at random?"
0,Keep well!
1,You don't need all your areas to match thematically. I'm honestly over the Grian/BDoubleO style of building. It's extremely generic and you see it everywhere now. It mirrors almost how all new houses built IRL are the same colour palettes and designs now. Its part of the reason why I've enjoyed going back to Beta Minecraft.
11,"Okay, I‚Äôm stoked for this vibe, it‚Äôs fire fr."
0,"I vote keep all the old builds. As a newer (relative to the world) viewer, hearing the histories of the world and all the old builds and projects  is cool."
0,The firefly bushes seem pretty cool. The particle effects remind me of kokiri forest in ocarina of time
0,"Hey Etho, I love the OG intro and I was wondering, is it still possible to open the original chocolate island world in the current minecraft version?"
0,Thanks Etho for the quality vid. I completely forgot about all the stuff in this update so thanks for reminding me how cool all the new foliage is
0,"The terraforming looks AWESOME! Please keep the orange sandstone and the well (but if the well ends up looking weird, maybe move it?)"
0,"Wow, we get a video every update"
0,Yeah. This update is pretty great. Gives you new ideas to try. I love episodes like this. Get to see Etho polishing and terraforming. I am still working on my river from last time. So many great ideas. Thanks again!
0,"Etho, relocate the well to the corner you said you wanted to build a farm for the new plants."
1,Let's play!
0,"ive been watching etho since i was 13 i am 25 now, every time he uploads it takes me back to the school lunch and chocalte milk days."
0,"Bro my survival world i live in a desert, so thanks for the ideas!"
0,"i think you could upgrade the desert well, keeping the original vibe"
0,"tearing down old structures? no, those are heritage sites. improving them? sure I think that's perfectly fine"
0,10:39 who else didn't hear anything and checked to see if the video had paused??
1,"Thanks Etho, it's always a pleasure to watch your let's play. A special thank you for promoting self learning, it is absolutely important. My uncle told me something when I was young, it was the best advice ever. Now I'm an old dude and I can say it to all the young folks: never stop learning."
0,"Loving the look of the mesa section near your desert town.  I think if you do keep the well, you redesign it maybe if it doesn't quite fit in."
1,"etho, why don't you replay terraria soon? IDK if you're up to date, but they're planning to add a HUGE update and QOL things really soon. I loved both of the 1.3 & 1.2 playthroughs, and i want to see how you'll play it differently with all the updates. 'cause 1.3 is EZed"
0,"Etho, now you gotta add firefly particles in the mancave at night, just another indicator of the time of day there :)"
0,"21:00 - dark thought... Did no one think to ask for a Villager Permit on Hermitcraft? And NO NOT HUMAN TRAFFICKING!!! THAT'S EVIL!!!... 

...staffing agency. üòÇüò≠ü§£"
0,"Hey Etho, I am currently majoring in food science, and it‚Äôs not very common to find others interested in the topic as well. I gotta know, what‚Äôs the most interesting or favorite fact you‚Äôve learned related to food science?"
0,You don't need to do new Minecraft trends. You can still do old building styles.
0,Keep the Well!!
0,"Etho!!! üíñ I love all your videos :D
and keep the well!"
0,"Your terraforming is so good!!! I love the mesa section so much!!
I haven't been watching long enough to have nostalgia for the lava well but lol I love it please keep it! Maybe add some detailing if you think it looks out of place?
Yay cactus flowers and leaf litter!! :D Dead bush with leaf litter around it is so cool!
The whole desert area looks so good now with the new blocks and your detailing!!!
Fun cactus flower farm design! And yay learning in general yeah!!"
0,"Hey Etho, what do you think of monads?"
0,Could move the well to that little corner you mentioned at 30:38
1,+1 to keeping the desert well
0,Please don't destroy that desert well
0,"I mostly liked the new terraforming, but having the sides of the path be that tall made it feel a little bit like a ""digsite"" to me.
Which could be a positive trait, but right now there is not really much other elements for that to fit in well imo.

I don't mind red sand, but stripped logs is a no go for me on many occations. Love the high contrast bark way too much for things like house corners.

Leaf litters seems to also be very easy to notice on the sand, and having them semi-randomly scattered made it feel like there was a very visible pattern.
I think chunks might be better for those than scattering them everywhere."
0,Leaf litter kinda looks like piles of poop. Do with that info as you will
0,"Finally, my prayers found the ears I was hoping"
0,"To really understand entanglement you have to understand the concept of superposition, which is a notoriously counter intuitive idea but sits at the heart of everything that makes quantum physics what it is. It takes most students a decade or more of dedicated study before they really begin to develop an intuition for these things, but they are nonetheless very real. The predictions of quantum physics are the best tested predictions ever made. More than any other thing, this idea of ""superposition"" is the biggest barrier to understanding between physicists and the general public today. During the first half of the 20th century, physicists went through a hell of a time trying to make sense of the things they were seeing in experiments. The whole classical framework of physics had to be rebuilt to account for the new observations. This was a long and arduous road fraught with wrong turns and philosophical debates about the very nature of reality. Today we have an excellent mathematical model and much of the early confusion has faded, but there is still a great deal of debate and controversy about how to *interpret* what we've learned. Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot wave, to name just a few. The Copenhagen interpretation is the de-facto standard but it is far from uncontroversial. I think the ideas of QM are actually easier to wrap your head around if you think in terms of the many-worlds view. You don't necessarily need to *believe* in the many worlds, you can get right back to Copenhagen anytime but just saying ""...and then God rolls a dice and picks one world to be real"". Entanglement is all about correlations or causal connections between superposition states. Imagine you have a hypothetical perfectly fair coin that never lands on its edge. If you flip the coin and look at it, it can only be one of two states, heads or tails, there is no other option. Okay, the fundamental insight of QM is this: ""if a system can be in one of a set of states, then it can also be in a superposition of those states"". Superposition is a mathy word... ""super-pose"" meaning something like ""overlay"" or ""add together"", it comes from the study of wave interference. You should think of it like a kind of mixture. QM says that if a coin can be heads or tails, then it can also be any arbitrary ""mixture"" of heads and tails! For example it could be 25% heads and 75% tails (slightly oversimplifying here), whatever. These ""mixture"" states are called superpositions and also ""indefinite states"" because they have no definite value, the coin is neither heads nor tails, but some strange combination of the two. If the state of the coin is 100% heads and 0% tails then we can say it has a ""definite"" state. This idea of superposition can be extended to any system with any number of states, not just 2. Even systems with an infinite number of states (eg. a particle in a box). It is this idea which is the source of all the craziness and weirdness in QM, if you can get your head around this, you're over the hump. The truly profound thing about QM is the realisation that this isn't some clever math trick - *this is how nature actually works*!"
0,I like the plants on the mesa area. It reminds me of the more deserty areas of the west USA.
0,"Hey Etho, since you were thinking about maybe getting rid of the sandstone well, why not replace some of the blocks with stairs or walls to make it look like its slowly breaking apart from old age? Make it look like years of bad weather have slowly taken affect of it's condition."
0,Hi etho this is the first video ive watched as a new subscriber. I really enjoyed it also i love the desert well so i would suggest you keep it
2,"wise parting words at the end, because you never know when ""useless knowledge"" might actually become useful in your life."
0,"""that's how people used to play in the past, just putting things wherever"" Etho, that's how I play now in 2025. My longest running world right now (only like 530 in game days but its fine) is a hole in the ground with miscellaneous things just on the surface around it"
1,"As kid I grabbed my snacks.
As a adult now I should be making a meal.
Either way.
I'm watching etho"
0,"To echo others, I'd absolutely keep the well!"
0,"Was not feeling great recently but your new episode has made my troubles feel lighter, thanks for uploading Etho"
0,"Etho you have to keep the desert well, otherwise I won‚Äôt be Desert Well anymore :("
1,"Mr Slab! Would you consider a second channel that is low effort mostly unedited videos of your hermitcraft or the old starblight desert footage? Or perhaps would you consider streaming again? Anyway (I know you have heard this a million times before but I just gotta say it) love your videos, thank you for being here all these years!"
0,At a minimum keep the button!
0,"Etho you're the best. Been a viewer since 2012. With all this coverage on AI, there are many benefits and issues that arise. Would love to hear your thoughts on it! Much Love - Sebastian"
0,Please keep the wellüò©
0,I did not know the moss carpet trick on water! Very cool üòÉ
0,"hi etho,
i dreamt that you did a collaboration with setsuna ogiso (niche fictional character) from white album 2 (niche anime). and geminitay. so. just a thought"
0,Epic deserts
0,KEEP it
0,Hi Ergo! I really enjoy the episodes that are focused on revamping old areas and reliving the nostalgia but seeing new ideas arise from old ones. Do you think you will be revamping some parts of the Man Cave with newer blocks? I think that it's been a while since the Man Cave has been touched. I think as well with terraforming you could come up with some funky decorations that I'm looking forward to seeing.
0,"I subbed to Gneiss Name some months ago, he does geology and color theory stuff and makes models and presentations for it in Minecraft. I love natural sciences so when I found it, it was an instant must-watch when he uploads"
0,Is Etho back back? 2 videos in 2 weeks ‚ù§
0,hot take: all the new plant stuff should require a shear to pick up
1,"Hi Etho, when I visit one of my old Minecraft worlds, for every build in it, it brings back all the memories of where I was in life at that time. 
I wonder if it is the same for you, and if you like visiting some parts of your LP world more or less because of that?
Have a great day."
0,First off I'm impressed by the terraforming! Second I think the well might go in that corner you thought needed a structure? Could be cool to keep it's history :)
1,"I love all the new stuff in this update <3 I vote to keep the well where it is, it looked fine in the end with all the dry grass around it, maybe place some small and big pots around it."
0,Keep the desert well! It's history.
0,This upload made my day. Thanks Etho!
0,Put a little broken caravan in that corner with some spilled stuff
0,Wasn‚Äôt there a 1 block tall crawling base that Etho built in the mountains by his desert?
0,"Hey etho, have you ever thought about mapping out your world? With how much has been built over the years it gets hard to remember what is where, i'm sure you have difficulties navigating too. Also in the description you wrote 1.21.1 instead of 1.21.5"
1,"Maybe you could embed the red sand generator in slime blocks as a sort of museum piece. That could look good in the desert biome , better than it is currently. Like it‚Äôs entombed in jello üòÇ"
0,I remember watching this guy when I was like 9 I‚Äôm 19 now man
0,I think removing the well is very good idea
0,I'm definitely an old school style minecraft builder. Random ideas there and here and all over.
0,"7:26 The reveal, it looks so beautiful! You did wonderful work!"
0,:)
1,"I think you should keep the well! You could blend it or change the blocks and improve it. Idk I like it but sometimes you need to erase the past to write more future. Idk that wasn‚Äôt suppose to sound deep but I think you get my drift. Anyways thanks for the video and all the entertainment over the years, heck decades now :)"
0,An idea for the terracotta side is an arch. Something like Corona Arch in Utah.
0,"I always love a Sandy City episode, I still remember when you started it.

Also, miss slab city although it wasn't meant to be <3"
1,"watching you find out and then explain the new features is always my favorite way of learning about the new updates! xisuma and others are doing a great job at giving us a lot of technical info, but there's something special in just hopping into the game, with very limited info on the update, and figuring things out!! reminds me of when i was a kid, and didn't know where and how to read patch notes, so i had to just experiment on my world!"
0,14:30 does that mean classic cactus farms dont work? since eventually they would fill with flowers?
0,So Etho is a Veritasium fan
0,"Hey Etho! Since you like science I thought I'd share my favourite science fact: magenta is not a real colour! Magenta is in between violet and red, but because violet and red are on opposite ends of the colour spectrum, the brain then lies, and finds the average of the two colours, and makes it up. There are also impossible colours, such as Stygian Blue!"
0,"You can always add like juniper trees, or bristle cone pine trees around to make your deserts feel less cliche tropical adjacent, and truly arid"
0,"The well should be kept, yeah."
0,"Perfect moment for Etho video. 11:20 pm, looking for something before sleep, got my tea ready, and.. Etho video!"
0,Keep the well for sure
0,10:58 the well HAS to stay
0,"Lets go, got some pizza and Etho LP life is good"
0,"Definitely keep the old build Etho! Either as is or repurpose the interior I reckon. I actually really like the contrast that build offers, especially now that you've dressed the whole area!"
0,broken farms update
7,"30:40 maybe move the well to the other side of the sand building. You can keep it and its history, but make it fit better to the environment"
0,dont destroy the desert well! build around it!
0,"The sandstone texture is very very coarse for being so high up, when its tonally opposite the rough texture of the tuff. The pattern is getting smoother on the gray to orange, then sandstone ruins it at the end"
0,I love learning about stuff unfortunately i have too much stuff to learn about and now it' going to be mostly for work. But i love more than anything is learning practical things like speaking a new language and learning to fix things on my own. The feeling of improving and mastering is great.
0,Do you and bdubs communicate on upload times or something? üòÇ
0,"For the well, i think moving it to a better planned location would work

Otherwise if you're interested in colors, i'd recommend learning more about what purple is - such as the ""line of purples"", confusion with violet depending on culture; as in language, place and time in history, and how that confusion interacts with the Abney effect. Also how languages start coming up with names for colours. Short and sweet."
13,11:49 I say remove the desert well and leave a few blocks like a ruin
0,"I say keep the well, but maybe move it a little so it‚Äôs more cohesive with the rest of the space, center it and make it a focal point of that little dip"
1,Grab ur snacks!
0,I love watching Etho on a sunday night. Calms down my anxiety before having to work on monday
0,Etho wants to get sandy city done by episode 600 so hes just reducing his upload speed to give himself more time at this rate hes got a year or so to do it.
0,Etho has awoken
0,dont remove the well!
1,13:42  am I correct that cactus flower has now broken cactus farms ?? üßê if so this is acctually a big issue ü§£ü§£
1,i say keep the well; it's so fun to have that!!
0,"History is one of the things that makes this series legendary, and it can't be replicated. Not by anyone. That being said, I wouldn't care if it changed to fit the terrain, or was even moved to an entirely different place. Growth and change are also good stories to tell."
0,Ooh! The overgrown mesa looks great!
0,I reaallly like what you did with the orange sandstone!
0,"I love the way the red sand area is turning out so far! The only thing that I think could use a bit of tweaking is that yellow sand bit where you added all of the grass. I feel like it is a bit overwhelming, maybe tone it down a little bit. Sometimes less is more :)"
1,Patrick: why don't we take the well and put it somewhere else! (like maybe that area you wanted to fill next to the sand factory)
0,Something tells me Etho subscribes to Veritasium
1,Cogito Etho sum
0,The ultimate desert Tuff Guy
0,I love the randomly dropped videos.üá®üá¶‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
0,"I think what really makes a highly efficent cactus flower farm hard is the fact that they can grow on cacti, that are one tall as well. If my thoughts are correct, you need to break the second block of a cactus (which makes it inefficient, because a 3 tall cactus has a higher chance of getting a flower) BUT you also need to break/replace the first cactus block as well. If I understand the mechanics correctly, if a 1 tall cactus grows a flower and you break it, it will neither grow back nor will the cactus grow. So given a lot of time, a farm would at some point stop producing?"
0,No! Don't take it down. It's so sweet. Just leave it.
0,So are cactus farms way more complicated now because you have to account for the fact a flower could randomly grow? Do cactus farms have to be based on pistons now instead of the pop-off feature?
1,"Loving the terraforming. I‚Äôd add some more splashes of colour going further out into the white sand, but the colours and textures are great. ‚ù§üéâ"
0,I grabbed my snacks to watch some YouTube and wouldn‚Äôt you know who posts‚Ä¶ YOU! Lol. Bubs and Etho amazing duo
0,I think you should keep the desert well! Also I love all the experiments with the firefly bush. It makes me think of an enchanted forest with the floating lights. Got me all inspired to build!
0,"hey etho i love the landscaping but i think that having it so wild may not make sense right outside sandy city, at least the paths I feel might be more well kept as they run through and between more rough and wild areas"
0,I have missed your episodes!
0,The prophecy‚Ä¶
0,"FloatHeadPhysics is a channel I‚Äôve been watching lately, he makes some really fascinating and easy to understand videos about relativity, gravity, light, subatomic particles, radiation, etc., I think you‚Äôd like them! My personal recommendation is to check out his series about the book Relativity Visualized, and especially the one about curved time.

Also, the terraforming worked out super well! Now‚Äôs as good a chance as any to utilize those mountains in the back for something like farming those new bushes and cactus flowers, though that would mean terraforming a section of the mountains all the way lol, up to you. Great video!"
0,"hey everyone, sorry if it's a dumb question, but what is that flying white build with the water going down (you can see it for example at 13:26) thanks in advance"
0,(there are so many hermit videos today! üòä)
0,It would be great for a Ethos spin on Vintage Story
1,Maybe move the well into the city?
1,"@11:25 I'd say remove it. It's there in older downloads, it has served its purpose. Few fans nowadays would appreciate its existence. Sure, it's nostalgic, but if it's that important, just move it somewhere."
0,"You could use buttons made from Cherry, Mangrove or that Red Nether wood for your cacti made of melon. That way, they look a little more like the actual ingame cactus :)"
0,"If you delete the well, you should rebuild it elsewhere."
0,"This video was fun to watch. I *may* have watched 2x the length of the video because it took me one hour to watch the first 15 minutes because I was playing Zelda for an hour while watching the video and kept rewinding to completely take in the video. I heard it‚Äôs good for channels to have viewers spending more time watching the video than the time in the video itself, so I‚Äôm happy I could do that."
0,I am for keeping the Well!
0,omg i just woke up from a nap and dreamed that you uploeaded something
0,Thanks for the upload Mr Slab üôè hope your having a good day
0,keep the desert well!
0,Happy Eid for me thanks dear Etho
0,"Hey Etho, I‚Äôd love to see more of the jungle cave project. I thought it would be cool if you added armour stands to the plantera fight."
6,"The desert changes look awesome! I love the tuff cliff area. In my opinion I don't think you should remove the well, yeah it looks a bit simple and old but it has been there for years and is part of the history of your world. It shows the evolution of your world, and the fact you had to make your own version of something that has been in the game for so long is a really cool detail!"
0,"Love the mini mesa, seems everyone else does too :) great work etho <3"
0,I really like the tuff in the badlands areas it kind of reminds me of bentonite clay you find in places like drumheller.
0,"I'd keep it, but find a new location for it."
0,"I personally think you don't have to concern about blending too much (that's new-school). Think of it more as history since it's an old world. You wouldn't tear down a historical building would you? Even though it's out of place and doesn't have a function, it's a place people can look at and say ""hey, this is how it was done X amount of years ago"". Please don't remove history, even if it's ugly. We learn from history."
1,i think you should tear down the desert well
0,"I am the same, I love science. That you mentioned that in your comment of the day.  This was so wholesome for me. Thank you Etho üòä"
0,Etho's new update videos are my favourite videos.
0,who remembers the world download with the house on the hill with the redstone torch that activated the tnt xD
0,Always nice to hear Mr slab
0,Keep the well
1,The Tango @ 23:19 
0,You could move the well to the corner you wanted a small structure instead of fully removing it.
0,on youtube ' Something Strange Happens When You Trust Quantum Mechanics' has a very cool experiment in the end of the video showing the theory of partials exploring all possible routes.
0,Idea: cactus flowers on some of your melon cacti?
0,DON'T TEAR DOWN THE DESERT WELL
0,Love the new little mesa area.
0,Sleep can wait
1,Keep the well!
0,An important thing to note about the cactus flowers is if there is a block next to where the flower would be they won't grow
66,"As a newer Etho fan, I love that his lets plays aren't super duper cohesive and don't follow some sort of storyline or anything because I'll literally just pick a random episode and watch it, note it down and keep going. It's an easier way to digest all the content I've missed over the years as a new fan. (Got into Etho after watching him herding the ravagers for frogger in Grian's video)"
1,"I think it's OK to get rid of the well. You don't need to be beholden to the past. Alternately, remake it to be your own design."
0,"I wonder if there's a way to preserve the well by incorporating or into the lore of the town? I'm just spit balling here, but maybe the well is seen as part of the town's historical district. You could have the well be the logo for some business that started around the time the town was founded, i.e. A bar. But maybe that bar is a casino now? Or a grocery store. I hate the idea of the well being entirely removed though. Whatever you do, I think it should be rebuilt somewhere, even if it is a little out of place. Maybe it could be the start of a memory lane."
1,"HEY ERGO, i think it could be a cool idea to use the coarse dirt after the path blocks to further blend the desert into the grass lands!"
0,"Oh my god, I didn‚Äôt know that about moss carpet on water. I need to add it somehow to my world. 18:04"
0,I hope you keep the well. Maybe make that feature displayed like something in a museum or an archeological dig so it serves a purpose and can be blended to the environment. Thanks for the video!
0,I really like the seapickles. They are like little cacti.üåµ
0,2 etho videos in 2025? we are truly blessed
35,"Hey Etho! You mentioned wanting to put a structure in the space to the left of the red sand thing... And also possibly remove the well...
Why not move the well?"
0,"You should keep the Desert Well, but if you think there's a better spot for it, you could move it."
0,The desert area is looking great! the terraforming that you did this episode looks good and has a nice amount of busyness. Thank you for uploading!
0,Love the terrain and the orange! üòä
0,Lichen can blend green and sand !
0,yet we still dont have vertical halfslabs but the ability to put leafs on 4 different quads is ok
1,HES BACK.... IN LESS THAN A MONTH?!
2,"One thing I like to do with old builds that look a bit meh now is to make them into ruins- just rough them up a bit, break some parts off and put the blocks on the ground nearby. Swap for cracked and broken variants. People love it."
3,"Great advice at the end, any recommendations on good youtube channels about any of these topics?"
0,"i would say keep the desert well, or if youre torn between getting rid of it and keeping, move it like some comments have pointed out; im a sucker for nostalgia and all that so imo i would keep it"
0,"Keep the desert well! Maybe add a path up to up and add stuff around it, but it's part of the history of this world and series."
0,"I know the exact blue LED video you're talking about, and it really was fascinating"
0,Am I the only one who‚Äôs disappointed that shrubs weren‚Äôt re added? We got so close to them being back. I‚Äôve been playing forever and now I‚Äôm complaining about silly little things like this. I will say this update is much bigger than I thought it was. I love your positive view of things. This update isn‚Äôt bad at all.
0,"If you haven't seen it, Veritasium had a video about jumping spider vision that I thought was fascinating"
0,Maybe use that desert empty corner to make a simple bonemeal farm for the new desert grass and firefly bush! Should be a relatively small and simple farm that could really fill that out and make a reason to come to this newly built area
0,"Although people want you to keep the well, I think that it would be ok if you were to move it elsewhere to free up the space."
0,1:31 I'd say keep it for old-time's sake. maybe you can convert it into something else in the future
0,Lol the dried leaves kinda looks like poop scattered around the desert üòÇ
0,Keep the desert well! But lol no etho I don‚Äôt think anyone knew about putting moss on the water lol.
0,"I love the new desert, but the bright green leaves don't feel right to me for some reason. Like the browns and the yellows,  they make more sense to me :) also keep the well!"
11,Don't get rid of the well lol. I remember dying in that trap üòÇ
0,Omg it‚Äôs eeeeeefoooooo
0,"I still want a boat with a barrel update, chests are one thing, but a fishing barrel in a boat makes a ton of sense."
0,i wonder if Etho would ever make a list of any of his favorite videos he's watched and learned from. Id be very interested to know what tidbits of knowledge he finds himself using most often üëÄ
0,16:33 that's a feather duster lol
0,"dear etho,
  How have you been?  Are things well?
This is my question:  What do you think about the announced vibrant visuals(vanilla shaders)?  Do you think this is a good thing or do you worry that it might negatively impact minecraft?  From what was shown, I think Mojang has done a good job but I was wondering what you thought. Will you use it in your LP?"
1,"35:00 ""Instantly"" and the speed of light are essentially the same thing in the context of human thought. We use the word instantly as less of a quantifiable metric and more of a way to describe something that happens as fast as we're able to observe it. We require light to observe things, so the speed of light is as instantaneous as it gets for us."
0,"Great video, have a good day!!"
0,You don't need shears to collect the firefly bush
0,"The tuff and Sand really makes the colors pop, looks great!"
0,It‚Äôs gunna be a good day üòä
8,"My favorite thing you‚Äôve ever made is that potion store in mind crack, the Etho style to your builds is something that nobody can recreate. The Mesa area is definitely up there in my favs. Also if you get rid of the well I‚Äôll scalp myself."
0,"Hi Etho, I really enjoyed this episode. I really like the new Minecraft update format I feel like you're getting more? Instead of a batch update you're getting little things over time, keeps the game interesting and exciting. I have a question, do you think you'd ever pick up No Mans Sky again? They've done so many updates and it's such a fun game I figured you would enjoy it and I'd love to see you play it. If not are there any other games you're playing right now that you're super into? Thank you for the episode hope you're doing well ‚ô•"
0,the terraforming is amazing i love it
0,"Hey Etho, love the videos! But don't you dare remove the desert well. It's a historical structure, and it needs to be there. I remember you adding it and when you showed the death trap. That was fun.

Instead, try to add a custom tree/bush near it. That'll give the well a story. Alternatively, a dead plant, almost as if the well provided water and life to the plant, and after the well got corrupted with lava, the plant died along with it."
2,"All historic monuments should be kept around. If it's ugly - congratulations, you've made progress!"
0,Keep the well i think it adds a touch that the world has been lived in
1,You can harvest firefly bushes with your hand
2,"I would love to see the well stay. The trap aspect of it can be removed for renovations of the area or changed into another function but the well, lava, and button should remain. With the new vegetation added the well looked great whereas before it stood out a lot. 
Then again I may be too sentimental, I'm still sad the horse jump area was removed."
0,"I've been thinking of that red sandstone wall, and I wonder if it might not be a good place to sprinkle in a few resin blocks as highlights? There's some angles where you've got red sandstone in both the foreground and background of the view, and they blend together in an unsatisfying way. (See 10:40)"
0,I think you should make the well look like an overgrown ruin. Then it will be a memory in the world but it'll be better incorporated in the environment.
0,"In that corner where you want to put a structure you should put the desert well. It's kind of just a random corner anyway, and the size is just right. That way you keep the history but less obtrusively."
0,i love your building style mr slab
1,"Hey Etho! Not sure if you've addressed this, but why don't you play on snapshot versions for your lp world anymore? Just wondering if there is a reason you decide to wait for the full releases."
0,"I really like the leaf litter usage in the desert! What if you used the leaves to indicate a direction the wind is blowing through the desert, to accommodate the new wind noises? make them all trail off in a similar direction, idk if you could use blocks to indicate that as well"
0,"first episode i get to watch as it comes out since im now caught up! mesa area looks so good, firefly bushes work perfectly there"
0,"i'm glad etho's so happy about the update, personally i find the new stuff kinda feels rushed to me? like the development manager was just trying to get the update out the door so they didn't have time to extend the custom variant capabilities to *the rest of the mobs that have variants*, or add sheep variants, or do more with the ""weapon"" item component, or add more sound variants for mobs other than wolves, or add more environmental soundscapes to biomes... and i hope they're given more time for future ""game drops"" (although, according to the teaser calendar during minecraft live, we might be getting FOUR *this year*...)

idk, maybe i was reverse-spoiled by the terraria devs taking as much time as they wanted to make a good update so when *any* dev team tries to get New Content Out Constantly it feels like being handed a new slice of cake before you've even started the first one, instead of finishing the first slice and having time to contemplate before you even realize there *could be* another slice..."
0,"Strays do have a player-specific drop, which is slowness arrows. So wolves would help if you wanted to farm those."
0,"Have you seen Jake Kelton Crafts redstone Animation videos, such as animated flags or fans?
I would love to see what you come up with if you give it a try creating red stone animation-contraption!"
3,Bebo has returned. My life is now on hold for the next 36:22.
0,"Once again, I dropped everything to watch some etho. A good day"
0,Have you thought about what you want to do after youtube?
0,"17:50 

Let me tell you I was shocked XDD I have never heard of that. Not even once"
0,Glad to see new update eXplored in the Let's Play instead of seeing it off camera on multiplayer server! Really makes me think of how all these new things could impact the Let's Play world and how they can improve it like the desert grass in Sandy City. Can't wait for the next episode...as always.
0,Keep the well but move it so that it fits in better
0,"I am a chemistry major and hoping to get into food science a bit, kinda curious, do you have any favorite food science related factoids?"
5,"A quick thanks for posting this today. It's a grey rainy day and was feeling a little blue. Saw your video upload and I smiled. You've brought many hours of joy over the years. Appreciate you, man."
0,Leaf litter would look great in that tree covered path you have
0,Seeing those falling leaves in your video feels so strange for some reason.
1,‚Äú I think were gonna use this stuff alot‚Äù  YUP‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
1,"Sabine Hossenfelder is hands down my favourite science channel. When I was in my PhD, by nature of my expertise, we had to do a LOT of philosophy of science. Sabine is one of the few science YouTubers who I feel talks like how scientists are meant to. Words like ""evidence indicates"" or ""it seems that"" or ""the consensus is"". Science is a method and a dialogue; not just a series of facts. I like it when public speakers nail that.

Also she has an oddball sense of humour."
0,Keep the well
1,"Hey Etho! I know game design is something that fascinates you. If you were to revise any system in Minecraft to improve its game design, what would it be and how would you fix it? Sleep? Hunger? Enchanting? Villagers? Transportation? Combat? Bloat? Something else?"
0,17:50 No way! :O
0,Thanks Etho!
0,"17:50 this works with normal carpet too, I think"
2,"33:15 you don't need two pistons to push the slime blocks since they will stick to each other, so you could make the redstone way smaller"
0,The blue LED video got to be the Veritasium one
0,Hey etho what would you think about making the mini mesa a bit flatter? The rock outcroppings you've made are quite jagged and not as flat as we're used to seeing with a badlands style terrain so I was wondering
0,I don't catch all of the episodes these days but it's still appreciated Etho!
0,"Transport the well elsewhere! Good for history, but might not fit there any more"
0,"love the badlands area, i think the orange sandstone looks great actually especially with how you blended it into the tuff. i will say i think the plantwork you did is maybe like 10% too much it feels a little tooo detailed and cluttered and sometimes having a bit more room to breathe can add a lot to a build"
1,"hey etho you said about learning the sciences. What about the arts? like classical music, or painting?"
0,"Thank you for the og chill minecraft videos. I dont really play it any more, but i adore watching your excitement about new content :)"
0,"I guess I missed some update previews coz it's my first time seeing the bush and the fireflies! Both looks so good and adds so much life , add the falling leaves too! Great job on the terraforming job, the orange sandstone looks fine to me. The leaf litter and desert grass could use a bit of clustering I think but overall fantastic job"
7,"The terraforming was amazing!! The difference in the level between the terraforming in this video and the last HC video was pretty incredible, you're accelerating so quickly !!"
1,"11:25 I think keep the well! It is history and blends in well, however maybe update it slightly? Making it a bit more detailed, taller and more pointy, I think would look cool."
1833,"Physicist here :) Quantum Entanglement IS instant, but it does not convey information (meaning, you cannot send a message using it), hence it doesn't break the speed limit (relativity). Hope that helps! And hey, great Let's Play video Etho, we were missing those over here üòâ"
1,"I love quantum physics, my favourite quote is from Einstein describing entanglement calling it ""spooky action at a distance"" and it's supposedly instantaneous. I especially like that anyone who says they fully understand quantum physics is either lying to you or themselves."
0,Is this the first the Etho has acknowledged the desert well?
0,I feel like this modern overly-detailed style clashes with the more classical style in the area around sandy city. Maybe it'll be better if he keeps adding more
0,maybe you could actually move the desert well
0,Doesn‚Äôt that mean your og cactus farm is broken now?
0,You're watching Ethoslabbbbbb.....you're watching EthossssssLABBBBBB
0,Been watching some old Etho FTB episodes lately. Feels like this is running at 2x playback speed.
0,KEEP THE WELL
0,Id say keep the well but improve it.
0,"I may push back a bit on the notion of dithering sand and grass, I usually try to create a nice mix of both like that akin to those beachsides which go from shrubby grass to shore. Mixing the new desert grass and normal grass has helped me out with that!"
0,"Loving the recent terraforming arc.  I think the well could use an update! Acknowledge the history, but make it blend in to the area.  Maybe a commemorative plaque or something to explain its original purpose?"
0,Move the well!
0,"üòä  I love it, it's like the wilderness and the desert are competing on the edges; and the pathways would be more sandy.  I watched that video as well, I think it was a Veritasium video. PBS has lots of videos on quantum physics. I like the quote that a physics professor said, ""If you think you understand quantum physics, you don't understand quantum physics.""  There is also a Universe Podcast with John Green and Katie Mack that was fascinating to listen to."
0,"Also the well has to stay. You did this to yourself by being like ""uh huh not everyone knows this but that's not a naturally generated well... üòå"" every 20 episodes since you built it"
0,"11:25
For the well you should keep it. However you may still change the build to fit the terrain a bit better. Idk keep up the good work"
0,1.21 jigawatts! Great Scott!
0,"etho, if you're looking for videos on quantum physics, Scienceclic and Domain of Science have great videos on the topic"
0,Etho you should consider adding string to stop the snow on the mountain with the glowing tree from your outro. It's kinda a historical artifact that got uglified by the update where they added snowy mountains
0,I sit down for dinner and what do I see? An upload from ergo waiting for me
0,I feel like you should keep your well ! It blends in nicely with the new foliage !
0,I'VE SEEN THE BLUE L.E.D. VIDEO TOO! I love Veritasium and the fact Etho watches him too doesn't surprise me.
1,Leave the well! The history of this world is the most important part in my opinion
0,You could move the shrine to the small side area. It would be a perfect fit!
0,keep well
0,ETHO UPLOAD YAY!
4,bdubs and etho‚Äôs upload schedule intertwined as usual
0,how is this etho mf both one of the best redstoners and one of the best builders...god of minecraft himself
1,üòÆ
16,"Me who hasn‚Äôt watched any Minecraft content in years, ‚ÄúWth is Tuff?‚Äù‚Ä¶‚ÄùVersion 1.21??‚Äù üòÇ 

Last thing I remember are those shulker boxes. Guess I‚Äôve got a lot to catch up to if my daughter ever gets interested in playing!"
1,"Hey Etho! I've noticed lately that when you make cuts in your videos it's right after you've just said something and the next clip starts immediately when you start talking again. Personally I feel like this can make sections of your videos feel very dense. Maybe it's a good idea to leave a bit more breathing room in between the talking when making cuts :) idk how others feel about it, but to me it's a little jarring. Besides that I still love the episodes like always <3"
0,It's nice going back to terraforming episodes
0,"Oh, this is gonna break the redstoneless cactus farms"
0,Hey Etho! Should I go to prom in a t shirt and sweat pants!
0,etho upload on my birthday this is the best present
0,"I'd move the well on the larger patch of sand towards the wheat fields. You can switch to a birch button to blend it in and maybe switch the lava to water and gather a (non-working) suspicious sand block and make a trap out of that for the next world download 
I love the mesa, i would have built more of it higher up the mountain on the other side of the yellow/red sand converter"
1,"I say keep the desert well. I think its unique/shows the worlds history. 

Also, question that I'm sure you've answered before but just thought i'd ask. Why not do video sponsors? I personally wouldn't mind at all and I'm sure a majority of your viewers wouldn't either. Especially if it helps you out/allows for more freedom for you in regards to what videos you make/when you make them. I know you've talked in the past about other games you would like to play on but that don't do as well as your minecraft videos.  Would sponsors help with that? (I personally have really enjoyed some of the other series you've made and would love to see more of those.)"
0,"I'm in love with the new cactus flower, It looks incredible!"
0,17:55 You can also do that with wool carpets!
27,18:53 it‚Äôs like leaving breadcrumbs behind you while you‚Äôre walking in the forest so you don‚Äôt get lost
0,"Super exciting to see this posted, especially right after I spent some time exploring the update myself! Really amazing speed, especially for the amount of work you did-- the transition between sand colors in the desert looks really good, and the rough badlands area in-between works really well! 

It's great that Mojang is really bringing some of the rougher areas of the game to life with new updates, so out of curiosity: do you have any biomes that you'd like to see an update for?"
0,such a simple wisdom suggestion but it's brilliant! do take care of yourself with a bit of knowledge about why we do things and what helps us!
153,30:45 You should move the well in this corner. This way you will preserve history and have space on the other side for the terraforming.
1,"I think that you should do the terrain whenever you get an area where sand clearly feels out of place, but you can't really just switch over to grass because it'll still be in a desert biome."
0,i'm gonna have to reload my world to see how this looks now!!
0,"Hey Etho, was the video you watch happen to be Veritasium"
0,"I like the well! but if it's obnoxious there, you could move it to the corner where you wanted a structure?"
204,What I love about your world is that it is just builds wherever you want to do builds. Never been a big fan of super huge cohesive worlds. That is for some people but I much prefer your variety.
0,Etho!! I love the way you did the terrain it looks so good!
0,ETHOOOOOO
0,I love ALL EthosLab videos!
0,"For the well, I think it should stay, but I would recommend giving it a little more detail for environmental storytelling. Either add some dry grass and maybe a skeleton head to signify it's long since dried up, or you could fill it with water and add some firefly bushes or ""bushes"" around it, maybe even with llamas in the area, for some movement. I miss seeing the llamas walk around sandy city -like that- where did they go?"
0,Bdubs and now Etho! AND ITS A SINGLE PLAYER UPLOAD!!! Today is a good day!
0,red sandstone the well!
0,"The terraforming is sooo good. Great job! 
I can't unsee that the leaves litter look like someone stepped in dog poo."
0,Will this break the regular fence-cactus farms?
0,"20:10

The dried leaves look like footprints‚Ä¶could be coyote trails in the desert"
0,"I think the desert well has to stay for world nostalgia reasons, even though it's ugly. The old (minecraft world gen) stuff was ugly, thats part of the charm!"
1,I lucked out my first wandering trader had the yellow/white flowers
0,I adored this episode. The terraforming looks amazing
27,"This is the first time I actually have seen the 1.21.5 drops in game, I've only seen clips and stuff like that from Minecraft Live. I love when there is an update and you experiment with it. You always think of something that I hadn't thought of to explore with the new items. 

I think that you should leave the desert well. It's a part of the world, and one with a fun story as well! I'm not ashamed to say that the traps have gotten me a couple of times, its one of my favorite parts of exploring!"
0,"I think with the well you could relocate it somewhere nearby so it's still preserved, especially as you made it yourself."
0,The well deserves to exist
0,leave the well!
0,Why is he playing this long series in an amplified world?
0,"I really like all the textures and stuff, but it all feels very chaotic and clustered together. I think it might be better if things were more spread out, although I know there's not much space to work with."
0,"i really liked this episode! 
very chill, exploring and studying stuff, terra forming and your voice were on point!
the new changes are really nice, so beautiful!"
0,Etho can you stream again please thanks
0,33:30 OOOOH sounds like Etho is a Technology Connections girlie
0,"Such a wholesome episode, thanks Etho :)"
0,"Etho! Love your videos, I was wondering if you plan on watching the upcoming Minecraft movie?  Also curious of your thoughts on it in general! Thanks."
0,"Keep the well, but modify it"
0,34:23 veritasium is amazing!
0,"Perhaps move the well? It is tiny enough that moving it wouldn't be such a big deal,and it does look a bit weird on the border"
2,Now in regards to your answer to the question of the vid: you said its harder to get a grasp on quantum physics bcs theories are different and harder to show/prove etc. But then you are interested in the way humans work. Based on the first part i would assume philosophy is not your thing bcs they [and me] like to argue different points and barely get anywhere; but then the way humans work is exactly philosophical antropology. I would love to hear your opinion about it :>
0,Fun idea: I added the leaf litter in a staggered line from my door way to create like a muddy entryway to my house
0,I WAS tired . Then I saw etho posted haha . I aint sleepy
693,Please leave the desert well. I'm one of the people you killed with it.
0,"I don't think you should get rid of the well, its nostalgic. However, it really isnt in a great place, maybe you could move it to a more open area of sand further away from the mesa-esque wall"
0,"Thank you Etho for the new video! 
Nice terraforming. Little inspired by island 7? Nothing wrong about little inspiration!"
0,Etho and bdubs on the same day?? We're spoiled for choice!
501,11:03 keep the desert well; I think it fits in nicely!
0,"GO GET YO SNACKS

edit: I adore the red sandstone look, it looks so good there! and please keep the well, blend it in maybe but its history, and I rarely see any world incorporate it!"
1,Wow that is amazing.  You should keep the well though as it has been there for so long.  I do wonder with the changes made does the fire charges Etho sign still work?
14,Love how the Terraforming is going so far. One minor thing I‚Äôm not a fan of though is I think it‚Äôs a little too busy in the flat sandy areas. Maybe remove the leaf litter that‚Äôs not at the edges and tone down the desert grass. Asides from that I think the area really turned out well and I hope some time in the future we can see more of your Terraforming learning experiences. ‚ù§
0,It looks good!!
0,What do you think about adding a museum type of area where you move all the things that dont fit anymore? It can preserve the history while leaving the area open for new possibilities.
0,"if a building doesn't fit the world, then put it under a tarp or build a building around it, that way you still got the old building inside a building that might fit the theme more. that way you still got the history from the old times."
0,"11:05 keep and expand that well, make it big fancy with some new blocks in the details."
17,"I love that you‚Äôve been in a building/terraforming mood lately! Not that I don‚Äôt love your usual stuff, but as someone who isn‚Äôt big into building and terraforming myself, I enjoy seeing the process unfold. I completely relate to testing things out, sitting with it for a bit, and seeing what works and what doesn‚Äôt.

I was also not aware of this update at all and I loved learning about it and exploring it through you.

Always a great day whenever you upload - thanks for all you do Etho! :D"
0,Maybe relocate the desert well? Its not a naturally generated one but the concept of it reminds you (and us now) of the little pranks you'd pull on world dowloads. That or make a mega lava fountain.
1,"Hi Etho, I know that you always mention that you watch videos on the side while you build. That are you favorite things to watch while playing minecraft. I hope you have a great day!"
0,keep the desert well but upgrade it and make it fancier
0,Did not expect the terraforming to look that good. I wonder if the yellow sand path / 9:25 would blend in better  to the red sand frame if the darker birch logs and planks were on the outside and the sandstone and sand on the inside of the path. I would say oak too but it may be too thin for that
0,"You could move the well to the small area where you wanted to have a small structure, then it keeps the history and makes the area cleaner, win win"
2149,"I don't think it's unfortunate that your world doesn't have an overarching theme. I think it's better that you aren't constrained by that, and I like that the 591 episodes make themselves apparent, and that you can see over a decade of history looking around the world."
1,Love the terraforming work!
0,Move the well to the corner and use it for the grass farm?
0,hey ergo llamas go around sandy city
0,I like the un-unified world. It shows so much history and it's just a bit more fun than these perfectly orchestrated worlds. (Those are also impressive of course but for me give me less of that nostalgic Minecraft feeling.
2,"7:30 Whoa... not what I was expecting! I gotta say, my first thought when I saw that wall transitional mesa thing was that it reminded me of some sort of alien or diseased biome, encroaching on the desert and terraforming it into an ideal environment for a new form of life... üëΩ"
0,"ergo, my friend, my pal, your description says v1.25.1...!"
0,"Keep the desert well, it‚Äôs great and it makes sense to have a well nearby too"
0,Ty mr. slab!
0,"fun fact, you can do what  you did with the moss carpet with all carpet, I use it for floaties and stuff like that."
0,"Don't tear down the desert well! A big part of this world is it's long and storied history, with the combination of old and new builds. Working around decisions you made a decade ago is what makes it all unique"
0,You could rebuild the well to fit the style better
0,OH MY GOD ETHO WATCHES VERITASIUM
1,11:45 I think you could remove it and build something more fitting that is a tribute to it instead.
0,we also need to find out how You made the llamas walk around in Sandy City before episode 600
0,"WEEL: I would keep the well, but move it to slightly to open space."
0,That's nice!
1,Okay but how did etho get the llamas to walk around sandy city like that
0,"Keep the desert well, but maybe put an Etho twist on it."
0,That generation in the birch forest is nutty
0,Spam a bunch of those little tan ones to signify that the area is not used often and is overgrown
0,The firefly particles might work well as snowfall or kind of kicked up snow as well
0,don't remove old builds
374,The old trusty Etho/Bdubs video combo
0,Keep the desert well!
0,I am so excited because I loved the Better Biomes projects you did a while ago
0,I hate the orange wall thing.
0,Like christmas morning
0,System is down at work. Seems like it‚Äôs ergo time!
0,when you started the mesa terraforming i was not loving it but you convinced me by the end. it reminds me of the painted hills in oregon.
0,Gotta keep the well. That well killed me about 10 years agoüòÇ
1,Pls don't tear down the well :(
1,the fireflies seem like they'd be pretty good for cave or old house dust. It's cool that they can be controlled with redstone
0,"the well is almost like the ugly brick thingy of the desert, keep it."
0,Where my snacks at?
30,"28:46 when the bush is hidden, during the day, the firefly particles kind of remind me of snow when it's just a light dusting"
0,Voting on keeping the desert well!!!! Even making some updates to it might make it fit better but keep the essence and history
0,Ethos desert update üëç
0,"Remember to bring your snacks to the Desert, it gets a bit sparse."
0,Hey Etho! Have you thought about returning to Pixlemon in any way?
204,"I‚Äôll be honest, I wasnt sure about the tuff at first- but when you showed it fully landscaped I fell in love! it‚Äôs such a nice little highlight between blocks!

I‚Äôm so here for the etho learns landscaping journey üòÇ its been so fun watching you go through trial and error with different blocks and placing styles üòä

thanks as always mr. slab!"
0,Maybe you can add some smooth red sandstone. Might help blend it a bit ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,When etho and bdubs sincronize their upload i know that im gonna have a good day
0,Keep the well!
0,Always good to see you in your LP world! I wonder if another block that might help with blending the badlands desert with the regular desert areas is stripped cherry wood. It'll bring in a little more of the red from the badlands into a color that's closer value-wise to the sand.
0,how did etho get sandy city to walk around the desert?
0,"Hey, Etho! I was looking at your subscriber count and it made me think about your YouTube play buttons. Do you display them in your home at all? Or do you just keep them tucked away in a closet or something? Anyways, thanks for all the years of content!"
70,"you asked about potentially removing the desert well - what if you just did a bit of a visual update to match the detail present in the area? i think personally the oddness of it is that it feels very early-Minecraft in style - because it is - while the rest of the area has clearly grown and evolved. adding some extra detail could solve that, plus maybe some extra plant life (dead or not, your choice) at the base, by virtue of it being a well. and maybe nudging it a block towards Sandy City, because it feels a bit crowded by the new terraforming, but that might be personal preference üòπ

i'm always seated as soon as i see you've uploaded but these ""sprucing up the place"" and ""exploring for new features"" episodes will always be some of my favourites, i think. and the new items look so nice in your newly-terraformed area :')"
4,11:05 keep it! Or move it if you want
0,"I personally think you should relocate the lava well slightly further back, maybe adding more variation to the sandstone blocks aswell :)"
0,"Thanks for the video, it was excellent :]"
0,Should think about adding large sand drifts that are over taking some parts of the wall
235,"I'm here for you sprucing up the desert well, but it absolutely has to stay. That's a historical land mark, that is. Even if you swap out some of the blocks for updated ones to keep in line with new building doctrines, that lava well HAS to stay"
0,The Desert Well must remain!
1,never been this early
0,Etho how did you get the red sand to walk around sandy city like that
0,I say keep the desert well.
0,"you say it‚Äôs probably well known, not putting moss in water blew my mind too, i just got a ton of build ideas"
1,Keep the Well!
0,KEEP THE WELL
0,"I think the desert well is in a very good spot, maybe you could spruce it up a bit but I think it is a good place for a desert well of some sort.

I wasn't sure about the tuff at first, but you really pulled it all together with the foliage and red sandstone! Etho is picking up terraforming pretty quickly. I think the terracotta boulders create an excellent contrast for the desert.

Edit: Of course Etho immediately reinvents the cactus farm"
0,go get your snacks!!!
0,don't tear down the desert well!!
1,How did ergo get the llamas to walk around sandy city?
0,Some ppl do things..but MY WORLD doesn't...gotta love the Etho.
1,Personally I love nostalgia so I wouldn‚Äôt tear down the well
22,i had my doubts about the mini mesa but WOW it turned out better than I ever could've imagined
0,"A polishing episode on #591 because of #600 world tour and download ??? Woohoo!!

One thing I don‚Äôt remember being finished or not was moving the comments of the day to the library. I think that happened like 100 episodes ago but I can‚Äôt remember"
641,"Haven't watched the whole video yet, but I think your world does have a theme, and that theme is 'evolution'. We get to see how one person went about creating in Minecraft over more than a decade, as the game changed. It's historical. We don't get to see that anywhere else at this scale. So I hope you don't remove anything you've done in this world, for the sake of posterity."
0,"Hey etho I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve seen the official shaders being added to bedrock, I‚Äôd guess you won‚Äôt ever use shaders on the lp, but when it comes to Java will you use it at all for newer series?"
1,The new terrain actually reminds me a lot of the prairie!! Red rock coulee in Alberta was the first thing I thought of!! It looks awesome and is definitely at the correct place in your world (at least in my opinion)
1,"Etho, the sandstone texturing and landscaping looks great. Also I wonder: if you could add any redstone component to minecraft, what would it be?"
41,I would say that you should keep the desert well. I loved the fact your world was booby trapped. And the desert well trap did get me tbh XD
0,‚ù§ today is a good day! and getting close to another world tour!
0,I‚Äôm so happy
0,you can also place regular carpet on top of water. i used to use it to make silence footsteps hehe
0,ETHO!!!! Back so soon!!! Yayyyyy
0,Finally not a Hermitcraft video! \o/
0,keep ye olde desert well!!
1,Wait Etho I think you forgot to include the other 30 minutes of content üò¢
1,"I say remove the old well and make a new one somewhere around the desert, then again the city has a well too doesn‚Äôt it? Maybe some cave connection via false well."
9,Never thought I‚Äôd see you work on that desert by the man cave. It‚Äôs been unchanged practically for 12 years
32,"If you keep pressing 3 on your keyboard you can make Etho say 'tobadouwee"" over and over again"
24,never been this early for an upload! 3am in the land down under right now and prepping for night shift tomorrow - cheers Etho for keeping me company tonight and throughout the yearsü´∂üèª
0,"I think for the desert well, maybe remove it but replace it with a new well with your improved building skills. That way you keep some history, but don't have to compromise on aesthetics.

Love your vids, long time fan <3"
0,"Sunday evening, new Etho episode hot cocoa. Life is good."
2,"Since the Desert Well is such an old build, you could make it some sort of Ruin. Style it like the badlands around it.

Leave the bottom free of lava and make it a secret water source like some deserts have.

Edit: maybe add a campsite, make the area look lived in a bit maybe."
0,"No i like the well!!! Its cute!! And i think its funny that u tried to kill us.
Perhaps u could rebuild it to make it cuter since it doesn't fit with the vibe? But i like it :)"
0,"for the well, i'd say keep it or just move it a bit so it isnt in a jarring position"
0,keep the desert well! :D
2181,11:25 absolutely keep the well! It‚Äôs history. I‚Äôd say blend it in but let it stay. It reminds me of small scattered old ruins that are scattered around deserts

0,"set aside the chores and homework, etho is here."
0,"I wonder if there‚Äôs a way to build up similar custom plants along the river to blend the desert and green river areas just beyond the walls. Instead of straight grassy areas with trees, using bushes, reeds, and of cat tail like grasses along the river bank to smooth out the transition."

1,Yippee
1,Hi :D
1,i love you ethooooooo
1,"Twelve seconds!! :D

Edit: I feel like Etho is just someone whose good at Minecraft. Like he doesn't just specialize in one specific thing (I know redstone is big but you can't say he's not a builder or a terraformer at this point), he was making videos before the game even released, he's been building upon the same world for over thirteen years, I could go on! When you say the word 'Minecrafter' and try to think of what it actually means I think Etho just fits the description best"
1,hoooyeh

0,Etho you can do the same way JaidenAnimations does and have the fanart slowly pass at the end of the video. Check it out maybe you get some inspiration from her
1,22:45 BOBER!!
0,33:42 PEA... no that cant be right AAAAAHAHWHAHAHHHAHA
0,28:22 etho has a folder for fanarts he sees :)) this is v endearing to hear as an artist
0,the beaver ü¶´ design made me giggle so much
0,The museum immediately reminded me of the Getty as soon as you walked up to it. Looks sick!
0,"31:27  ""16 is like a nice round number"" um, actually, its a nice SQUARE number (haha math jokes)"
0,"Way too late, but a comment on the rocks for future rock purposes:  When in moving water, the sides will be less curved than the top, because the river has worn then down over time. Taking off even one layer on the side will create a more ""cylinder-dome"" shape that is more natural"
0,23:38 If I were you sign up for aunty  Gem school for rocks terraforming she do a very good job of it.
0,"22:54 to be fair Etho some of us many people are fans of the hot beverage tea that over time the teeth gradually turn yellow some that use the cigarettes also have this issue of yellowish - brown teeth, I personally a a fan of tea so in all honesty to save myself to having to have a few trips to the dentist I personally won't have an issue of yellow shaded teeth especially if it is going to add strength to them, can't speak for everyone I won't have a problem, however if young and do have white teeth and do not use tea staining tea or maybe use that whitening chemical to make teeth white then nope would not what it, now other time and a fan of tea drinking I would not know a problem they going to be yellow anyways."
0,"Rivers naturally keep curving due to things such as sediment and erision until they hit themselves, in which an oxbow lake is formed. The curves that rivers have is the path of least resistance"
0,"I would Trade Up to Iron Infused Teeth, but I been a transhumanist since I first played Syndicate on the SEGA as a young boy."
0,"When thinking about creating rocks in Minecraft, definitely Bdubs at the top of the list and I also think of Grian! His main base and shop was all rocks so he'd also be a good person to ask about rocks"
1,"23:15 in a heartbeat- if that existed (and didn't come with health risks) then orange teeth would become the new attractive trait overtime- just in virtue of it signalling good health and therefor better genes and- you get the picture. but even jsut ignoring that, a lot of people who have been close to people with repeated teeth issues would, and people who are fanatic about their own health, and youtubers would advertise it via ""I Tried Recommended Toothpaste and it made my Teeth ORANGE"" or ""I tried xxx for 30 days"" - in other words, yeah, it's totally have its audience"
0,"i hate how slow your upload schedule is when i'm watching minecraft, but having not watched minecraft much recently the slow uploads is kinda nice because i dont have to watch 20 videos to catch up lol"
0,What do end crystals do
0,Me not wanting to finish the season 37:36
0,"Soooo, Etho's probably seen Hermitstuck, lol"
0,"rivers will meander as they encounter ANY friction, including a few extra pebbles that are stuck in the river bank, this will create a ""torque"" and softer soils will also erode faster than others

rocks also rarely are bare on top because soil gets deposited, plants grow on top, rocks crack and plants grow in those cracks, etc. all to have grassy foliage on top of the rocky surface

plants will even try to grow through asphalt"
0,People could submit that you can use their art in your videos when they send it to you.
0,The hermits are loving waterfalls this season! Its so cool to see all the different styles you all come up with
0,One thing that helps me in making rivers is remembering that rivers (generally) follow the path of least resistance
0,Dude I love your ideas for like a beaver dam and the falling dmg game in the next episode. So cool :D great to see this season back cause I was following and suddenly it stopped that was a bit sad. Great to see you guys are back!!
0,"It's so cool seeing so many of the hermits try branching out from their main ""Minecraft player archetype"" to try different things and learn more from each other."
0,"The artwork in the museum is AMAZING. Especially the Decked Out related ones gave me goose bumps, oh boy the memories of that time came rushing back. Great job everyone who sent in fanart!"
0,"I have a thing call flourosis which makes tooth enamel harder and more resistant to cavities. It causes spots and yellowing, kinda like a beaver lol. It really didn't help that I had buck teeth too üòÇ"
0,"15:42 add water. That will give you a visual to work with, and will also change how much and what type of shading you need.

16:49 I spoke too soon."
0,"I‚Äôve been watching him since my early teens I‚Äôm now 24 this man is still a legend can‚Äôt believe the vibe hasn‚Äôt changed props, ‚ù§"
0,"As a Kakashi and Etho fan in equal measure, Etho fanart goes so hard"
0,17:37 Terraforming canon event
0,Love the beavers and idea of their enviroment ‚ù§
0,"If you wanna show off fanart in the videos, like DocM does, why not have a Discord server or email where people can send their art if theyre ok with it being displayed? That way you get to share it with the community and promote the artists, while also being 100% sure people have consented to their art being displayed 

Although i guess obnoxious people could submit art that isnt theirs"
0,Love the kakashi hatake skin
0,"Bdubs is a genius, if it comes to immersion and scenic views."
0,"etho terraforming and bdubs making farms, what a time. I need more !!!"
0,"I was thinking that campfires may help add some detail to the top of the beaver dam.  Also, your terraforming and building in general has really come a long way, it's looking really good."
0,"I remember watching a video about how rivers curve because they were already slightly less curved, so the rocks aren‚Äôt completely necessary"
0,"your building scenes are my favortites! im not into redstone, but love your exictuions. you are an artist in many forms"
0,kakashi?
1,Etho will never know what happened üíî
0,Jenna
2,"for the rocks: this feels weird to say but there might be too much blending. I think you need more contrast?  with pearl's rocks, there's a bit spiky, so you see the difference with the values a bit better 

+ sometimes the non-stone blocks can register as a bit weird with stone. cause subconsciously you know it isn't stone. mb add a bit of regular stone between the tuff n gravel and stuff and the concrete powder and wool? dunno if the warm/cool value of the regular stone matches up though"
1,"Give me the orange teeth and i would chuck wood, like the woodchuck"
1,bro I just hopped in this video and its been like  10-12 years since I last watched Etho back in highschool. I was surprised he's still using the same Intro after all these years. It's like watching my childhood again. I watched him so many times as a kid I know hes using the same exact intro
1,Just wanna say I absolutely loved watching your videos as a kid. I was in elementary school at the time and now I'm fresh out of college. Thank you Ethos! Words can't explain the nostalgia.
0,Ethos such a cheeky dude
1,"Late comment is probably invisible, but ... I'm not sure if knowing that Etho hoards his fanart to hard drive makes me feel better about also doing that, or worse."
0,"So in real life, rivers actually curve and bend and meander naturally, and those curves and bends change slowly overtime.  This is because there's a natural element of randomness to how the terrain erodes.  If you see a straight river in real life, that means that humans have messed with it to keep it from ruining their property, and to prevent it from flooding.  And like many things humans do, that's bad for the environment.  A straight river is a dead river."
0,You need higher darker points and spots of darkness
0,Your intro reminds me of f11shstance - when I look up from a fishing spot and everyone around me are ducks!
1,Building nature scenes always drives me crazy because there's so many details you can add but then you step back and it's almost not noticeable
0,"I feel like the rocks in the river are odd, because they're boulders so they probably need a separate color palette compared to the river wall rocks. I just like placing boulders in places so I'm not sure what the fix is exactly, but I think they're just missing some slight separation."
0,"4:17 so true, respect for Doc for pulling it off with ease, while being a ""fluffy"" goat inside."
0,15:22 it looks good rocks also have specks of other colors. Rock On!
0,"Bit late so doubt you will see this, but as someone who grew up on a rocky river, when rocks are in  a river, you need to inverse the texture, water smooths the rock out, so anything underwater should be a smooth texture, and then rougher textures above the waterline.

Then also the layer that is at water hight can be much darker than the layer above, rather than a smooth transition, wet rock is dark and dry rock is pale (making several assumtions about what type of rock ""stone"" is in minecraft), this can be used to show where water ""splashes"" like on the outside of a bend or around a waterfall, by having darker spots above the water line.

It looks great! But maybe just some things to consider for your next rock river project as you do care about the ""real world reason""."
0,can you show us a full showcase of the house it looks reaaally good
1,I love the beaver dam ecosystem idea! The beavers look really good and the river looks great so far! üòÑ
0,Just got done watching Doc's latest episode. Can't wait to see you play his new game!
0,white rocks might be cool

0,Damn Etho you did a really good job with that museum area! The colored blocks you chose all did a fantastic job of making the artwork pop! It adds a lot of beautiful color to the space without taking away from the art. My kudos!!

0,Ethoooo
1,"Hey Etho wasn't sure what video to post this on but some ideas I think your fans would like

1. use classic textures on your LP world but modern textures elsewhere, your primary singleplayer is a nostalgia series and the new textures ruin the feel

2. don't wait so long to post 1 big video, but rather do like you used to, daily / bi-weekly videos of smaller more relaxing content of just you playing, mining, building, etc."
0,"I know this is older video at this point, so likely won't be seen by Etho, also i stopped to type this at the 14 minute mark, sorry you already do this later in the video, You can use the darker shade in the line of stone for the watery parts, as it would make the stone look wet."
0,im ngl i was half expecting him to punch an end crystal at the outro when he did the whole f5 -> punch/wave goodbye thing
0,<3 u etho
0,Wow haven‚Äôt watched a video in years decided to look you up and I was very surprised to see you still posting hermitcraft vids. They were always some of my favorite along with the redstone videos. Glad to see you still at it man!
0,I think the rocks before you added any shading was a lot better. I think less is more when it comes to environments.
0,"I love the terraforming exploration! Things are going well. I think the key for Rocks that I have found is to give them volume. It's hard to do rocks and have it follow ""typical"" Minecraft generation. But giving it a rounder shape is good.

The Beavers are PERFECT with no lever legs!! They look AMAZING! Maybe blackstone for the eyes might work? This was an awesome episode!"
0,2 weeks in between episodes
0,I hope to see wadzee on hermitcraft one day
0,"ive been super curious, what's the redstone for the crafters you have on your storage walls. you used to have the redstone componnents, and i wanted to make one too in my world."
0,"Etho: i build to make things look good. Im not really into making things look real

Also etho: we need boulders in this river to make it look real!"
0,"That fanart is gorgeous! I love how the frames complement the artworks perfectly, truly this community is so talented and I‚Äôm so glad people are coming together to appreciate the Slab Man"
0,"I loved the free glass prank in Season 7! My first season of watching Hermitcraft! Thank you for the videos Etho, it‚Äôs always nice to come back to an episode during my lunch break :) love your terraforming too!"
0,Etho was slightly on minecraft live!
0,"26:30 ""fox in my berries"" out of context sounds so inappropriate"
0,Thanks for posting this etho. I know I‚Äôm a little late but I have been going through it and this just makes me feel like I‚Äôm a kid again. Thank you man‚ù§Ô∏è
0,"Etho i LOVE the lake, even undecorated it reminds me of a trail in the mountains my family goes to every so often. I think if you added a dirt trail, cradled in trees and undergrowth, maybe a dock/boat ramp on the far side, it would be beautiful!

Of course, its your build, the lake just brought a vivid image of the lake i know in real life, now that its spring im gonna have to drag my family up there again. 

My suggestion with the river is to maybe lower the water level; yes rivers change direction because of changes in the landscape, but it also changed simply because of erosion and what the ground is made of. Most flowing rivers and streams are carving away in canyons or ditches, and you have to walk down steep ground to reach them, so they more follow the shape of the land. Boulders dont need to shape every curve, maybe theres just a hill with more tree roots holding the dirt in place in the way!

Looking forward to future episodes, as always. hope youre doing well and good luck with future projects!!"

0,"Even as I've aged out of the game itself as so many of Etho's longtime viewers have, Etho still manages to make engaging content. For me it's the beaver stuff in this video, and the light shading in the previous episode. He always seems to find a way to keep it interesting!"
0,How would the River look if the water were diagonal as it went down a layer? You would have to make the water layer underneath non-source blocks.
0,"It's always a question... Who owns it anyway, does this count as a derivative work and if so, do you own it? They are not violating to your rights if posting it with permission but idk who would own it without it being explicitly stated"
0,Hey Etho! You could try and put spruce or dark oak buttons on the dam. It would add some texture but not create chaos. Cheers!
0,"I mean Most rocks in rivers usually have seaweed on them. Mossy cobblestone kinda thing, yeah?"
0,"Rivers in Minecraft kinda just appear.
Would be nice with like a high up lake that the river flows from. Maybe a cave that the water drains in to before flowing on
edit: beaver d*mn is a very good idea!
edit edit: And what a great idea with a lake! =D"
0,"10:20 That can be it too! But the way the rivers curve, is due to the currents eating their banks. So it eventually curves so much, that it ""snaps""! Then the whole process starts again. Its really interesting"

0,"Rivers actually curve on their own in time. The water flows to the edge of the river and knock loose some dirt and small rocks. That makes the other side of the river shallow and the other deep. Also in time when the river is really curvy, the water finds the path of least resistance and skips over the curve and creates a C-shaped lake."

0,"I'm about four days late and not entirely done with the video but I think an important thing with the rocks is: If you want them to look like rocks, stray away from messier textures at the top. Wool and concrete powder look like wool and concrete powder even next to water. Best to stick with messier textures that you choose only for color in darker areas that will not well-seen (i.e. near the bottom of the river). thats just my opinion though"
0,Rock ideas: keep the rocks smooth at the bottom where the river has eroded them; and make the rocks up top rough. I think that's where your distaste for the concrete looking tops comes from?

2,"Wow I got recommended an ethos video in 2025 after years, finally yt algorithm is doing something right"
0,"Yo. the rocks. dont make so many and dont make them so small. Its better to maybe make one or two bigger, 'feature' rocks. Like... go bold. 
I'd recommend using some reference materials too, it'll really help you visualise and pull off an idea and choose the right blocks too cos itll work kinda like a palette too. Personally i use the word 'fantasy' when searching for reference material cos it tends to give lots of art / painted concepts which can often be a lot more visually appealing than real photos."

0,I just designed a ghast tear farm and it was an awful failure. Thanks for showing me a better option!
0,Miss you etho boo
0,I think the rocks lining your river are too high. You might have some sections of the river where at the bend the less erodible material is visible but frequently it isn't visible. You might walk on moss right up to the edge and then realize there are rocks under you. I think you'll like the look of it more if there only a couple of spots with tall rocks.
3,"Etho: I don't know anything about art

Also Etho: *designs a perfectly adorable and functional gallery space off camera*

I've been doing some rock texturing myself recently, and something I've found is that you can definitely get too textured. It helps to have a base block that you're texturing from, as the main block in whatever you're building. For rocks, that should be the type of stone, be it Stone, Andesite, Netherrack, whatever. Having smooth central pieces of that main stone gives focus points for the eye, and stops you from ending up with what just looks like grey dirt"

0,"10:15 Did you know: Rivers meander on their own. If there is even a slight disturbance somewhere the water will have to flow around it, the speed of the flow on the other side picks up and washes away more ground. So the bends in a river become more and more extreme until they form a full loop and the river cutzs through to straighten out. Thats how the horseshoe lakes around rivers come to be.

So there doesnt really need to be a reason."

I'm not artist nor do I play the game, but regarding the river rocks: I feel in parks and such when you're walking along rivers you don't generally see much by the way of boulders along the shores (at least sticking up like that). 

I can think of places where you might during ""rapids"" / when the river is descending quite a bit. (Plus consider that you're going through a ""field"" with the river, so the only place where boulders are are in the river. I think that contributes to them being unnatural because a river would take the path of least resistance. ie run through soil, not rocks. 

I think it's much more common for there to be trees, with roots being what keeps the shore line up against where the water is.

Not sure if this will help, but FYI the build looks great even if you're critical of it, loving it :)"
0,Invisible item frame with stairs or slabs for the legs of the beaver!
0,"Not all river influencing is natural.
On the build side, there could be some retaining walls helping shape and define.
Also, some rocks will be eroded below the waterline, don't slope everything back."
0,"Maybe add some leakage to the dam so the river has a ""reason"" to flow. With the waterfall at the end the river would be empty in no time"

2,I‚Äôve watched Etho for over a decade and still look forward to every upload <3
0,"you should mix in some other colors to the boulders, maybe some brown or if you can a washed out blue or green, maybe even some rare but occasional yellow. mostly grey but you know add some diverse color tones to it to break up the monotony. if you're gonna add green or yellow or red , what ever color scale from grey to the selected color. also consider how you imagine the sunlight is hitting the stones, this way you can but some consistency where the lighter colors should go. like if there is shady trees near by, those stones would appear several shades darker then the ones in direct sunlight. idk food for thought."
0,Terraforming rivers with TNT is too much fun. It also gives the river a very natural shape. You‚Äôve done it again. Thank you for the great idea!!

0,"Etho, you did finish a project in one video from start to end!
The ghast farm, the End crystal shop, the museum decorations.

As for not showing the full process in one video, I think it just gives the series a good  sense of continuity! The audience gets a little taste of the idea in one video, then they look forward to future videos. And they also get to play around with the idea in their own minecraft worlds for awhile until you show it in a future episode. (hopefully not years later )"

0,My hot take is that ‚Äòshading‚Äô at that scale doesn‚Äôt look great. Especially using blocks like wool. IMO it reverses any ‚Äòimmersion‚Äô that the shading would bring. Could just me be though I‚Äôve been a hater of that building style since day 1.

Amazing job everyone"
1,"I thought of some ideas to make the river more alive idk if that makes senseüòÇ‚Ä¶ but anyways I think if you add level changes at the edge of each turn (considering the current of the water flow in the river) to create a sense of motion.

Now this motion would create an upstream which is more polished due to erosion (meaning smoother/polished rocks so basically lighter colors) and the downstream side of it would be darker as it tends to gather dirt and moss. ü´∂üèª"

0,"Rivers and water in general tend to flow along the path of least resistance, which means they twist and curve around obstacles such as rocks, hills, trees, and other geological features. 
Your boulders are massive



And the rocks along your river are comically large compared to the size of your river, so they stand out quite a bit. Also, having one of those big rocks located at every single bend and curve in the river further clutters your landscape around the river. Additionally, the block palette you've used for your rocks doesn't really integrate into the rest of your landscape, so they pop visually. 

You could decrease the size of the rocks, maybe choose a different palette for them, and use different geological features to force the river to bend so it's not all just big rocks around a shallow river."
0,"Etho, a suggestion for the nook in the art gallery:  that nice open space in the middle of the carpet is a good place for a long bench to sit on to admire the art for longer."
0,Does etho post videos outside of YouTube? Cause sometimes he talks about stuff he did that I had no idea about
0,"A cool idea you could do to flesh out your river a little more is to put blocks under where the water flows, so when the water is going to the next block down its not a straight line, and then remove the blocks of course. Basically flatten out the height changes"
0,ITS A ETHO!
0,"Rocks shear honestly and I think that may be what is missing. I see large rounded clumps which looks man made, but a more natural feel is rock layering and then shearing where you often get shelves or cliffs depending on how it 'sheared'. That may give you a concept to run with and see how it feels."
0,"I like watching your videos because you DON‚ÄôT follow the tried and true tested YouTube video format.  I hate it.  Everyone copies each other, and it‚Äôs all so fake.  ‚ù§"
0,You should make the bigger rock granite because it is one of the harder stones
0,"Hey Etho, for your rock problem, it might be a texture issue. Most rocky rivers are smooth with layers. I think you might have added too much texture.
I like the green rock you did, but I think if you want to add red rocks you might want to add more than one. 
You could also try some yellow? Maybe add some as sediment near the water edge to show the water breaking the rocks? (also if you add some sand under the water near the bends, it will add a little pop for when you are looking at the water."
0,I‚Äôm sure NOTHING will happen with those crystals he placed!
0,For the waterfall you should check out Jake Kelton Crafts's video about using piston feedtapes and redstone to add motion to a build. I saw that video after watching the fan one which inspired Mumbo and was wondering who was using waterfalls but it would be a perfect place!
157,"Rock feedback: I liked the final look of the rocks the most, and I think it's because the textures closest to you are the ""natural"" ones (actual stone materials). Wool and concrete powder and stuff are great for shading at a distance, but up close they look odd and out of place."
0,Hey Etho. Can i recommend something? Maybe make a booru and have a specific tag people can add if they would be okay with their art appearing in episodes.
0,"Man, the jingler card straight up spoiled that mystery for me lol. I never knew it was Cub. I wasn't super into the lore, i just knew about it and wasn't sure who it actually was. The first time I saw that card, i was straight up like ""dang..."""

0,"For the rocks it may be worth putting some noticeably darker blocks at the waterline to make the edges look wet. And since the underwater sections are hard to see, you're only getting a third of your colour range above the water so that might take some shifting too. The mossy rock is a great step though, definitely the best looking one of the bunch. I wonder if the intense greens and saturated colours of the surrounding build might see more benefit from darker rocks, but then you couldn't use that amazing pale moss tech, which is adding a lot of detail."

0,Funny how the sweetest membest take over the vilain role
0,"A bit of feedback on rocks by the river: Think about real rocks by rivers. Most river rocks are worn smooth on the inside (facing the river) by the river and flood periods rushing water. They're often a single type of rock per big boulder, so mixing rock types (for instance, andesite and stone) might look odd compared to just mixing shapes, but there's often a decent number of big boulders per river, so you can still get that variation along the banks -- kinda like you did later in the video (like around 23:00). I'd say, past that, think about silt/depositions, adding gravel and tuff as more sandy/silty sort of material that gets added on the sides and along the bank due to the river dropping the silt stuff off as it goes past -- put bigger piles at curves where the water would pile up and lost momentum, even momentarily, and less at straightways where the water can more easily pick up the particulates. Then, finally, no wool -- why would there be wool in a rock where no sheep/fluffy animals are nearby? Trade out that material for some other gray material, or mix in brown wool for it to reflect the beaver fur being washed around."

0,I think the rocks look good maybe what‚Äôs missing is the blending into the dirt. It‚Äôs a harsh line at the moment maybe mossy cobble and other blocks to blend. Bdubs used some warped block (can‚Äôt remember what block exactly) to add these highlight bright teal pops that are so good.
0,You say out of your element but real life experience of nature is definitely helping you. Definitely can tell the outdoors is in your wheelhouse.
0,I think people are generally more worried about their teeth falling out than they are about breaking them from chewing on wood
0,"I like seeing you experiment with things you don't have much experience with! My personal suggestion would be to have the water lower. I  real life, that river would flow with an enormous force with that gradient and volume. It just doesn't really match with the environment. The lake is also really high üòÖ"

0,"I'm fairly sure PO stands for the permit office, I guess that POE stands for Permit Office Enforcement/Enforcers?. Poe-poe tends to be slang for the police force"
0,19:15 did he say December??
0,So the science behind why rivers bend is quite interesting it actually has really very little to do with obsticals preventing it from going in a straight line and more to do with the current of water as it goes down Holland around corners it's amazing there r YouTube videos on it
0,What a final clip with the shop! üòÇüòÇ

0,We at 1 video month now. This is becoming sad
0,"Hey etho, rivers curve naturally, constantly, by virtue of physics at play. The sides of rivers (in contact with the riverbed/things in the riverbed) move slower than the center, which inevitably causes curving, and rivers constantly curve back and forth along whatever natural plane they've happened upon. Over time they wiggle back and forth at grand scale. You can virtually arbitrarily curve rivers any way you want as long as they're realistically scaled curves.

Having a narrative isn't bad though, just letting you know for future terraforming, rivers are neat and like to dance around."
0,"Month of December, classic Etho."
0,When artists put artwork online on a reddit does that not imply they want it visible? Makes no sense to me they would put it there and not want it spread. In my opinion if you put it publicly online it's free game. As long as you don't try to sell it as your own of course.
0,I love beavers
0,I wanna see more beaver activities around the dam‚Ä¶. I think a lot of your audience would agree
0,"Rivers tend to curve more on flat lands, because of the way the sediment it carries from the mountains deposits on one side more than the other to cause the stream to be pushed out, so it would be more logical (but maybe not as pretty) to have a more Gravel based obstacle in the curve of the River"
0,"The free glass prank wil for ever be my favorite prank. When people ask me wat HC is, i tell them about shade-e-e's"
0,Bober? Does he bite?
0,"Showing someone's fanart isn't violating their rights if you stay within fair use.  Commentary and critique purposes are covered under fair use.  If you are showing the art and *explaining* why you liked it, what lead you to pick it, that is perfectly legitimate.  Things like commenting on how you like the lighting effects on the shoe.  Including it in the *world download* was the much more difficult area that required doing things to cover legal issues."
0,Also self sharpening teeth due to being more iron rich in the front.
0,Ah yes the new end crystals shops is totally not going to create ANY problem
2,"I honestly actually prefer the way you do things. Starting new projects every 5 seconds. It makes it fun! And we get to see you actually doing the things you enjoy and are thriving on!

When you enjoy playing the episodes are more enjoyable to watch. 

So I prefer when you don‚Äôt finish things hahaha"
0,i didn't expect to learn so much about beavers today ! really like the level of detail and i think the beavers look quite cute ‚Ç¨0:
0,I would 100% trade white teeth for orange teeth

0,"Re: Permits:  Go the malicious compliance route... make the shops.  Stock them with one item for sale.  Set the price at 12,000 diamonds per 1 item.  Your shop will be made, it will be stocked, and you will never have to restock it üòÇ"
0,"Hey Etho! Love the dam and the ü¶´ s.  They normally build the den separately from the dam right? Might be an interesting addition. ""The Beaver Dam"" hideout?"
0,I would 100% trade my teeth (not perfectly white) for stronger orange teeth.
0,Maybe on the beaver dam some armor stands holding sticks or saplings poking out would help sell the beaver dam aspect.
0,19:18 The month of December‚Ä¶ We need Etho hitting that record button more
0,"4:15 I'm not a huge fan of the villain drama-type stuff, but then again the free glass prank didn't come across as especially villainous, if only because nobody had to actually watch anyone going through all the chests of free glass and emptying them out. If we did have to experience it ourselves however, then maybe it'd be villainous and tedious and frustrating and all those bad things, but since we didn't it just seemed funny and entertaining. I'm mostly just here for the cooperation, cool builds, and funny interactions."
0,10:02 rivers will also get bends due to sediment deposit. Fast flowing water brings gravel and sand and then drops it down stream. This causes buildups that change the flow of water and naturally it diverts the path of the water. Oxbows are an example of this effect.
0,"The beaver is so cute!  Great idea to do the beaver dam; I haven't seen anything like that Minecraft, and it looks dam good."
0,You need to help or start a war like Grian does usually.  Or prank their beds and ender pearl stasis chambers
0,"You built a pile of rocks, it sounds like you wanted a boulder"
0,Build some beavers also
0,When making rocks it‚Äôs best to use just regular stone and andesite or gravel. While using stones utilize the half slabs and stairs
0,I would have orange teeth if they would be stronger! It is a pretty big fear of mine to shatter a tooth.
0,"Etho large ‚Äúdetailed‚Äù boulders would actually be amazing, idk if you‚Äôve ever rock climbed, a bouldering environment/crag would look great around the lake. If you‚Äôre not too sick of rocks already üòÅ"
0,"So I know for creeks, the sides are a ton or dirt and mud; not alot of rock/boulders. So I‚Äôd say lose some of the rocks on the side and have exposed tree roots because those are typically what causes the shift in direction."
0,White teeth for the win!
0,PEA... WHAT DOES PEA MEAN ETHO.... ETHHOO?
2,"Etho, you need more boulders peaking out of the ground around your base. If you want everything to have a logical flow, why does only the place where the river happened to flow have boulders that reach up above the ground level. It would make more sense to have the occasional stone patches in the ground by your pace to set a tone that there are a lot of rocks right under the surface. Because right now it is like those boulders only exist to serve the river, but have no natural explanation."
0,That‚Äôs me guys 26:20
1,Etho could you please put some running water through the beaver dam? :)
0,For your rocks in the river since you have specific rocks for all the bends you should try shading different rocks a different shade then the one next to it. Could make each rock stand out a little more and create a gradient across the river so the stone tops won't seem as bland
2,"Rivers naturally meander over time; they don't need a boulder or rock to create a winding shape. Difference in water speed cause natural erosion and deposition, which over time forms meanders. You can see this process when looking at the difference in young, mature, and old rivers. Creating a meandering river with different river speeds and flows that form cut banks and point bars would look realistic and really cool!"
0,I did not expect to hear Etho talking about wet beavers today.
1,4:13 I think it's very interesting that Etho sees himself as a villain on hermitcraft.
0,"EXCELLENT video. The quick tcg explanation was just enough for me, the teraforming process exclamation was informative, soooo much variety of content, and beaver facts! Loved it (ps i personally def vote for more mossy inserts on/around the river rocks)"
1,"Rocks by water are smooth at top, because running water flattens and smooths out stone. Have you ever seen a river stone from the river bed?"
0,I love the etho-logical beaver dam ideas!
0,That ending.  XD     Oh god I've missed these episodes.
0,I do not think anyone would say your videos are getting long. absolutely love watching your videos!!!
0,So happy to see a new video!
0,"love you and missed the vids, never stop and hope this year has been treating you right"
0,"If you really want to be Exile proof, I did think of a easy way. Details after the fold.





Setup a stasis chamber attached to a timer. Have the timer be for something like 8+ hours. Setup 2 buttons  in your base. First button chunkloads and starts the timer. Second button stops and resets the timer. It's a basic UnalivedMans Switch. Now all you have to do is hit the first button when you log in and the second before you log out (or get close to the max time).

Now if you get exiled, you just wait and eventually you get sent to your bunker."

0,Etho casually threatening the whole server with end crystals spread around the shopping district is wild

So glad to have you back on Hermitcraft and posting! I‚Äôm absolutely in love with the idea of you terraforming stuff, though I know how hard it is. My first few years that I‚Äôve tried never really succeeded, and im working on it to this day. As for the cute little beaver? Omg! Adorable! 

Also, that‚Äôs so you to say that you‚Äôd try to avoid the POE (permit office enforcement) and then just smack down a shop in the middle of their office üòÜ üò≠

0,The bever is perfect. Saw a chubby one cross the road today up in the Yukon. You dont really see the legs when they're tucked under a fat butt
1,i just want to beaver to know that they are so loved
0,I believe Scar gave over the interior work to Skizz for the POE POE station which is why there is only a crazy elevated table for them to meet at in there.  Love seeing your process and hard work on the river rocks!  Absolutely love the beaver dam idea!  Very unique and very Canadian eh?

1,"I used to be a framer at Michaels and I love what you did with the concrete columns!

0,"Etho, if you lock the hopper minecarts (by going over an activated activator rail) the hopper minecarts will not be able to pull items out of the hoppers above it in your sorter.

4,"Dear etho, as well as anyone reading, (question later on what‚Äôs your favorite native plants and animals, native could mean local, state or nation you live in.) 

I love the beaver dam idea, also how Canadian lol. I‚Äôm a big fan of supporting beaver habitat expansion in the United States, we have a lot in Minnesota but they used to be much more prolific here and across the continent. Fur hats and all that, they also can be a nuisance to people flooding roads and fields and whatnot. 

Slowing water from point a to point b is an important principle in habitat and eco restoration. It‚Äôs the fundamental key in restoring decertified land, like the desert forest of Shaun Overton‚Äôs Dust Ups Ranch here on YouTube. 

Hence why I‚Äôm such a fan of beavers, their outsized positive impact on the natural world they inhabit. Also that they use their ponds and lakes over winter as refrigerators to keep their veg fresh and I think that‚Äôs cute.

My question is to you etho, if you see this is, what are some of your favorite local, or nationally local native plants and animals? And why?

For instance I love that wintergreen is native to mn, it‚Äôs a treat to stumble apon and taste such a fresh ubiquitous flavor growing native and wild. And Minnesota wild rice is so tasty. I love the look of smooth hydrangeas, it‚Äôs rare to see native perennial flowers used in landscaping here, but it‚Äôs getting more common. My brother is a landscaper, sharing the love of the natural world I have, he constantly teaches me
About different plants, how they grow and how to identify. His work sends him to a lot of conventions and sometimes he takes me.

Trees like the white pine are also incredibly beautiful, and the prefect places for eagle and bard owl nests. Pine martens and Fishers are cool, I think they are some of the few animals that successfully predates on porcupines. But what I‚Äôm really excited for in the next few weeks and coming spring months are our chorus frogs, I cannot wait to have my window open for them sing me to sleep, their choir drowning out the highway near by and seemingly the whole world. So when I sit out on the dock the late at night it‚Äôs just me, the moonlit lake lapping at the shore, the frogs singing and maybe a fog so the lake seems endless. I don‚Äôt exactly spend a lot of time in nature and outdoors but wow do I have an appreciation for the life around me. And take immense satisfaction doing when I can to minimize my and societies negative impact on it.

Anyways I could ramble on, maybe I‚Äôm wrong but watching your videos for years and years I get a sense you appreciate nature and the land around you. 
Clearly I know you enjoy computer games and tech as well, so do I and as I‚Äôve gotten older it‚Äôs occupied more and more of my life, but I just saw that beaver dam and it struck me to ask you about something unrelated to the digital world we all engage in. 

-with love from a long time viewer and someone who started playing Minecraft around late 2009-20010 K Spivis. (That gives me cred right? Jkjk lol)

Also ps I know this ‚ÄúLetter‚Äù is probably too long for any of your questions of the day and I‚Äôm not even confident right now that you do those on hermitcraft videos but I thought I‚Äôd write to you regardless. Maybe you‚Äôll see  this maybe you won‚Äôt, maybe others will see this and respond with their some do their favorite native plants and animals, but I hope you do too, if you even see this but i wouldnt blame you even if you do see this one long comment among thousands of others, obvi. Okay goodbye."
0,I really like that mossy rock!
0,"Once all the beavers are built, you HAVE to wire them all up to flap their tails in unison. Beaver tail slaps are iconic, and it would be so funny."
0,"A beaver damn is such a good idea. Love that, should be used more because ecologically they're insane with how good they can be in boosting biodiversity in an area, mimicing them is used quite a bit in rewilding from my understanding."

0,etho slowly typing out PEA for Permit Enforcement Agency was SUCH a good bit
0,"love the terraforming! for the rocks: theyre a little horizontally stripy, maybe incorporate a little more shading between rocks to break them up a bit more? also, the two different colors of rocks right next to each other doesn't make as much sense for sedimentary rock, but if you fade the different colors over the course of the riverbed it might work better, like where it's dryer the rock is a little redder or something. or maybe on one side of the riverbed the rock and biome in general is different and the way the sun comes down and the river splits the landscape affects the different rock formations and deposits?"

0,Ethos alter ego taking over again and stealing the shop.
0,"I've been using a modified version of this sorter on a bedrock realm. It took a lot of tweaking for my personal use but  it's still functional.

Hopper clock just as you have that sends out carts. It runs through a water stream under a chest that gets loaded with items. Cart goes through entire system and at the end, leftover items pull from the cart and water streams back to a chest above the input water stream, but directly after the user input chest. This means i can input full stacks and let it go. There's a standard MIS at the input for things like cobble, dirt, etc. Most of the tweaking was around bulk items getting through the entire system and filling up the minecart dispenser when the cactus breaks the cart"
0,"I highly recommend you add mossy cobble to your stones, especially because it makes sense for water, animal life, etc., to cause moss growth on river rocks, but also because it helps with the color transition from the stones to the surface grass!"
0,I actually started using tnt to terraform because of you and never went back
0,Couldn't you use and activator rail to lock the hopper minecart so it cant steal any items?
0,This guy knows beavers

0,"i think youre off to a great start with the river rocks etho! I love terraforming as a peaceful way to pass the time, but I‚Äôm ofc no expert. However, I did want to suggest maybe adding a block to unify the layers. Generally I go for stone/cobblestone. I‚Äôll make the overall shape I want out of that base block, then go in and add shading and highlights here and there. Otherwise the ‚Äòboulder‚Äô ends up looking too much like different layers in the ground, instead of one cohesive structure! 

Anyway, this was a fantastic episode and I really enjoyed watching üòä maybe talk with Scar a bit to get some more ideas? hes a landscaping expert!

0,33:48 you had me rolling on the floor with laughter here üòÇ pea
0,"My two cents on the rocks:

Large stones that break the direct flow of water are usually homogeneous. Cobblestone (in Minecraft, the block I mean) is sediment. It looks like dense pebbles unlike stone (the block, again) which looks like a cube of solid stone.

So when making rocks that are going to block the flow of water, I would think you'd want those boulders to appear as a big, solid, stone, rather than sediment. Because you're trying to mix up the palletes in your boulders (which is good and necessary) you're mixing in some blocks that I'd categorize as ""packed sediment"", but perhaps it feels a bit off because it doesn't seem like those blocks could affect the flow of water. 

Another way to think of it is that if we had a ""block"" of cobblestone in real life and put it in a rushing river, the water would push the cobbles apart and sweep them away.

This is also why you get a lot of sediment at the bottom of rivers, but if the boulder is affecting the flow then it's still solid.

Excellent episode as always!"

1,"I think the issue with the rocks might be the block textures rather than colours.

0,"10/10 episode thank you very much! <3

Got two suggestions for the terraforming: 

1. don't be afraid to use normal stone in the rocks as well! I think the thing that you can't quite put your finger on/that makes it ""uncanny"" is that there's no regular stone in there at all, and so the minecraft brain doesn't fully register them as rocks 

(Also personally I'd ditch the wool, because it has a strange texture for a rock, but that might just be me)

2. Take a good chunk of the plateau in the ""balcony"" area towards Pearl's base and lower it by 5 or 6 blocks to create a second plateau, say, a 20x30 block area or so. Put some natural stone stairs leading down - it will help break up the terrain and enhance and frame the panorama view even more! Bonus if you can see down to the foot of her base (and perhaps even the ocean) when walking out from your front door"

1,Etho. You got too many rocks. Rivers do randomly meander especially through flat land. The other option is small cliffs. Just raise the land on a spot you want to turn away from 5-10 blocks. Also you're in a mountain put stones out of the river where you want it to go down. Make rapids

0,Can Poe really exile Etho? He's quite literally being a hermit
0,I think what makes the rocks in the river look meh is that they lack some shape language. They are more of a coat of paint on top the landscape but don't have distinct shapes worked in or out of them. One trick which I have found helpful with that is simple rule that blocks of different material ie. rock and grass have to be at right angles. Materials shouldn't transition on the same plane.
0,I think the beaver was actually better with the item frame still visible; looks like a little face
0,Definitely add some reeds and lillypads to the lake
0,On the lake you should use green glass panes/ bamboo and brown candles to make cattails as well as  sugarcane and seagrass around some edges to make little nooks that fish can hide and live in.

0,"couldn't you have a way for fans to submit fanart and give you a license allowing it to be shown in a single video or something?

I mean, you would probably need to double check with a lawyer that you're not taking away their ownership of the piece, and make sure that its just allowing you to use it in a single video, but that might be a solution if you really want to show the artwork (though this would ofcourse be a lot of work)"
0,"Rocks: the side facing upriver add sticks and mangrove roots etc that ""got caught"" on the rock. Downriver side more greeny mossy cobble stuff because the water doesn't flow as much so it gets all algaeeeyy-y :P
Love the damm, can you swim inside? That'd be a cute detail"
0,"Ahh Etho, you missed the chance to extort diamonds from poe via crystal shop. Since it is a low demand high input item and the permit office wants a shop for it, you can in a way ask them to fund the shop just like the real governments fund the less profitable but needed business."
0,"9:57 In real life, rivers actually tend to bend more and more over time until they either get so curved that they collide with themselves or they hit something they can't erode as easily
You'd need justification for it being entirely straight if it was long enough and surrounded by dirt"
0,Etho who are you gonna vote in next canadian elections ?
0,"etho, you should make your end crystal shop a super high end with basically an all white room with only one thing in it and it's super rare which means it's super expensive! so that means no one will buy it so you won't need a large inventory. win win"
0,"Not only rocks change the flow 
Its mostly the debree with different mass and density that settles at different point from entering the river and it also depends on the volumentric flow (speed) of the river and also the it changes over time by the average diameter of the riverbed becouse it narrows by the settlement"
0,"About rocks: think of them shape first. Rocks are pieces of big burried stones. You have to give a feeling of this, a bit like some 90s 3D artist making a low poly rock, get that shape to work for your landscape. Then only do detailing.
Also about the gradiant: it's not progressive at all. The wet par its much darker. Even if you want to shade according to lighting at least work along this logic of faces. If you just do bottom to top gradient everything is shapeless. 

IMO your approach of ""making sense"" is excellent. If you feel stuck, always come back to it.

Your barrage and pond are great btw. Awesome beavers!"

Thank you for the video and I love to watch you learn"
0,"Wait, the permit office warned for months, you didnt build shops
Deffinetely their fault?"
0,"i think the issue with the rocks is that there's just too many of them. natural rives have more shallow sections where the water wouldn't be more than one block deep, and this is where the mud shines. if a river is wide and then has a small section the water will flow quicker through that section, likely eroding rocks quicker, while the mud will pile up on the wide slow sections. vary your sections and chop the top off those rocks. it makes little sense for the ground to go up around the edges of a river when it should go down instead. unless you're going for a more man made channel type situation but considering the beavers (which looks so cute btw) i'd say widen everything and make for more of a transition of the edges. more vegetation in the slow sections (dripleaves, leaf litter, mangrove roots, lily pads) could make it look more natural but that's a later step."

0,"I think, for competitive games on Hermitcraft that span many months, it would be better if the trophies didn't go to the people that have the highest scores that season, but to the people who both have the highest scores AND beat their previous all-time highs that season if they've been a winner in the same place or higher before. This prevents trophy farming, where Joel wins the first try, i.e. he has to play better than his best. It makes winning feel like more of an achievable goal, because winning isn't necessarily directly dependent on the big numbers you see on the scoreboard. And it incentivises pacing yourself a little bit more slowly and not overplaying the game, lest you set a high score that is unbeatable by your future self."

0,"FYI, rivers don't need boulders to curve, you can watch the video ""why rivers curve"" frome minute earth if you want to learn about it but the TLDR is that any slight curve will make it so the water slams against the exterior of the curve and will bend it even more over time. So the slightest asperities could lead over time to bends."

With the rocks, I remember from one of bDubs' videos that he tried to use the highlighting and shadows to make each rock/boulder distinct from each other which can be found in the boulders around his ""starter"" house. I wonder if doing something similar would help it not feel like one jumbled stone, but instead separate big rocks making up the rivers edge? Just a thought"

1,"The places where the river drops, you should add some partially submerged stones to break up the drop point. Most rivers have drops like this when there is a row of rocks blocking the flow"
1,"You are on the right track for terraforming with trying to make it make sense! Like the rocks to give the river a reason to bend. Its not always necessary but its a nice marker for where you should place details around your river. What i think matters more for the trajectory of the river is the overall shape of the area. Only adding rocks to guide it is going to make it feel man-made even if the rocks are supposed to look natural. 
The thing with the rocks feeling off when you go further away is not rly an issue with the rocks but just an issue of having to tie the river in better with the rest of the area. You could lower the water level by 1 block, whittle down some of the rocks and some of the terrain between them to get some erosion gaps. Think that would both give you a nicer view of river and help tie it in with the rest of the area. Also think adding a few rocks outside the river instead of having them only around it would help tie it in with the rest.
One thing you could do to add texture to the rocks is just add moss or folliage on them. Maybe even add some folliage into the parts of river that would be calmer and that could serve as a ""seed"" for the folliage to creep up on the rocks as well. 
And one more thing that kinda bothered me a little bit with the beaver dam is that the volume of water flowing from it feels like too much to be leaking from a dam."

0,"Hello, I love terraforming in minecraft and it takes ages, but when working with water a really easy way to make it look tons better is to make everything under the water slightly darker than above. So If you've got the pale moss in an area where water is going to be going next to it, keeping the pale moss above the waterline but changing the block below to be darker makes it look awesome.

As to your rock issues, as someone who has done EXTREMELY little terraforming, one thought that I had was that something that was looking unnatural about the rocks was that it was one big boulder, not like a bunch of medium sized rocks. So maybe try playing with depth and different color palettes to make it feel like there's multiple rocks, not just a big boulder? idk, something to try perchance"
0,"The beaver made me laugh so hard, I love the design"

0,"While river courses CAN be diverted by large rocks, that is not the reason they meander.

The reason has to do with flow rate and dissolved sediment. When the dissolved sediment drops out and builds up enough to divert the water course it is essentially lengthening the rivers total course and therefore reducing it's effective flow. Eventually reaching an equilibrium where the rivers length and its ability to carry sediment are balanced."

0,"Recommendation for the rocks? Cover them up with grass! It'll give the appearance of a river bank, look good from the land (just grass/hill), and look good from the other side (rock).

Otherwise, I honestly think that the smooth stone looked just as good. Detail can pull the attention away from the shape and pull focus towards the texture, which I don't think is preferred here. Smooth stone gave the idea for what's going on with boulders (which I generally associate with being one kind of rock, not multiple) without being too bland (once the water is added in)."

0,"You could actually just give the Poe Poe back any permits you don‚Äôt want to use - but this is so much funnier!
For the rocks - maybe add more variation in their size and reduce the number? Another thing that makes a river bend is different densities of soil (soil that has more clay in it will erode slower than that without) you could mirror this in-game by using the different dirt types: coarse, regular, and rooted - regular should erode fastest (lightest), then coarse dirt (heavier), then rooted dirt (roots bind it together so it can resist erosion better). It may also help to pick an imaginary position for the Sun, then you can make areas facing that Sun lighter, and those facing away nice and shady - that should add depth to your rocks."

0,"Hey Etho. With rocks I find less is more. Your rocks were quite busy. Which might be why they didn‚Äôt look right to you. The last two rocks that you made were good. The granite rock and the moss rock. Rocks near water usually have moss or other green colouring to them and rocks further away from the river, usually have different colours and depending on the environment and temperature is how much green they may have on them. I am from a hot tropical area and we have a lot of mossy rocks around rivers. I love the beaver idea. Looking forward to seeing how that idea turns out. Thanks for the video."

Anyway thanks for the video Etho, they're never too long, and this was awesome üëç‚ù§ ALL of that fan art is amazing btw you guys, wow!‚ù§

Etho- you asked for feedback on the river? I was thinking, anytime I've been in a natural forest area with like a creek or a small river, I've noticed that there are a LOT of brown or brownish rocks forming the waterway, it's not all just grey. I think granite is a little too red to work, but maybe if you could work some dripstone in there, and maybe something else more brown? Mix that in with the grey rocks, and then add some moss/mossy stone to the places where the water wouldn't be moving quite as fast, like especially above the water line so it's visible. There are also other colors of lichens and things that can grow around those areas, I think you might have to just play with it a little. But those would be my tips üòä (Also, I like the tuff and the dripstone blocks for their textures, they both kind of insinuate movement, and I think that works for moving water/maybe the idea of light reflecting off the ripples and stuff.)

Also, best shop idea ever, well played üòÇ‚ù§ They never said it's illegal to use an abandoned structure.  The holes outside from the imminent explosions will add a nice weathered feel, too!"

0,"@EthosLab 
The problem you're having with your gradient is that, as you mentioned, you don't see any of what's below the water.  Bring your darkest blocks up until they are at or just below the water surface and then do a truncated version of your gradient.  Water makes dirt dark, so lighter colors under water make no sense unless they are individual stones.
I suggest invisible armor stands holding the lighter color rocks just at or barely below water height.

Second, your ""Feature Boulders"" should be a different color from your river bed to draw the eye and keep everything from looking monotone. Even if it's just that they are a shade or two lighter or darker than the rest.

Along the same lines as that idea, you can incorporate a few ""gemstones"" in random places, especially below the surface.  The sparkles of color will do amazing things.   For this, Id trade the light color stones for Glass Blocks, Amethyst Blocks, etc...

Also, break one block on your Beaver Dam to let water pour over.  It gives the build life."

0,Turn the rocks into boulders. Make some of them extend 3-5 above the ground
0,"I think the main issue you're having with the boulders in the river is the layering is too uniform, and they're all kind of 'facing the same way'. Try and layer some rocks at an angle against others, these aren't necessarily sediment rocks, they could have fallen into the river and gotten lodged at different angles, and different heights. You have all the same blocks in all the same layers no matter the rock, which Is contributing to them looking very blob like and non-distinct. I would also try to add some highlights on edges of different rocks against each other, not necessarily the brightest block in your pallet, but at least a couple shades up."

0,"I prefer the cartoon type villains, Cleo was exceptional this week! üòäüíê"
0,"Fun fact about rivers: Even if you had a perfectly straight river, minuscule deviations in its flow will cause portions of one bank to be eroded more than the other, which will in turn direct more water against that bank, which will erode it more, eventually forming a curve. The interior of this curve, having slower-moving water, will deposit sediments, further shaping the flow of the river. The curve will direct the water against the opposite bank further along the river, doing the same to it.
Eventually, this cycle of erosion and deposition results in rivers so curved they look like a bunch of S's in series. When the curves grow so wide that they meet each other, the water of course takes the path of least resistance, and stretches of the river dry up - but the deepest portions of the curve remain as lakes, and due to their curve they're known as bow lakes.
So if you want to terraform a river, figure out where you want it to start, then where you want it to end, and mark out the likeliest route - then as you're digging it out, pay special attention to making sure its curves are wide and sweeping, and try to match each bend with an equal and opposite one further down the line."

0,"Rivers don't really curve for a reason. They are chaotic, ever-evolving systems. The slightest turn will cause water to erode one side more heavily than the other, which causes the turn to grow, which causes further erosions. Eventually, the curve grows so big that the river hits itself, making a shortcut for the water and slowly drying out a large section. The cycle then repeats."
1,"The rocks look good! But I think the issue might be the graininess of the block textures, it makes the rocks look like they would weather away from the water easier than your idea suggests; of them being tough enough to resist the water. The granite ans mossy rocks look way stronger."
0,You could use coral block in your river.

0,amazing video etho!
0,"I doubt you'll make a change to it but keep in mind that on lakes and rivers, the water stains rocks at where the water level is. Usually at and under the water line, rocks are way darker."
0,"Love the river Etho! The mossy rock is my favorite one too, but I like the contrast of the granite. Overall, I think you should focus on having a nice ""background"" shade that's meant to look like one main formation, maybe mostly smooth stone/andesite shades, and then mix in granite and diorite features, to mimic the way rocks form naturally in the real world. Cleo could probably lend you some of her geology knowledge in that department :)
Also, you should try tripwire hooks for the beaver's feet!"
4,21:09 you could add camp fires to the dam
0,"I love that beaver dam idea. I think the red sediment river is pretty cool. The green mossy river suits the base colours but the red clay feeling gives it a little pop.

0,"Initial rock thoughts: One mistake is treating pale moss like its lighter than tuff just because its smoother - its darker. Another is that you weren't looking around at the grass while building your rocks because they aren't shade matched well, at least on the jungle side."
0,I cannot articulate how much I love the beaver!!
0,"My feedback on the rocks - I think that the concept of ""These asre boulders diverting the river"" is getting lost and it just feels like ""There is a gray edge to the river"". I think going with a bolder boulder design with the red would help make them feel more solid. In additon using buttons can help give context for the above view of ""oh these be rocks"".

Adding seapickles or other glowing items under the water can help to let people SEE all the cool details your adding as well!"
0,i think some gold ore would look great in your river
1,5:00 i actually burst out laughing

0,"I think with the river the problem is you're using rocks to build a bank, rather than the river and the rocks carving each other. That dip under the rock int he river is a good feature but I think it would do better if you made the rocks ont he far side a bit more cliff-like and possibly instead of looking like piles like a large boulder sitting atop it. Also the darker parts should peak out out fo the water where the river is hitting the rock, at it is constantly being sprayed, and more moss would grow in those areas. a bit less rock and a bit more dirt above the water might also help, and of course foliage will just make things look better in general. Foliage is gonna want to grow next to the water so theres gonna be topsoil and little scraggly bushes growing from the rocks. especially with how deep the river is, it can be expected that its been there a long time, but with the beaver dam feature consider the while area would be flooded before that, so maybe bring the bank back a bit where the soil is and have the rocks shape be more affected by the rushing water. part of it is that the rock features end at the riverbank despite sticking up so high."

0,"For the river, I would put a defining line where the water is, so that it's dark *under* the water and light *over* it. Right now it looks like you just made a gradient and then chucked some water in wherever. (cause you did ...)

For your end crystal shop, you could just craft one and set the price to 1,000,000 diamond blocks. Technically fulfills the contract and you won't have to make more. (EDIT or you could do some absolutely diabolical Etho-level trolling, well done)"
0,It was amazing to catch up. We'll see you back in 3 months
0,You could possibly detail some of the river with root wads using mangrove roots and maybe some stone buttons in and around the water
0,"Fun fact: Rivers actually snake naturally, even without any notable obstacles. The reason in general is that the erosion tends to make even small bends even larger. This happens motly on rivers with small slopes though."
0,"Hey Etho, you mentioned that you enjoy logical reasons when designing your builds. While logic is a great focus, it can sometimes mask some other aspects which would make the build a lot more natural looking. For example, water may divert because it hits a dense rock. But it also diverts because it hits a softer area of soil, or reaches a slope. So if the rocks are getting too frustrating, maybe instead make that portion of the river use some ""softer"" materials, like clay and mud, all the way up to the grass, and then have maybe some course dirt as a buffer between the rock and that softer patch?

Either way, I love the video and hope that the landscaping doesn't wear you out too much."

3,"Etho your videos make me feel like a kid again, can‚Äôt describe how much i enjoy them, thanks and keep it going!"
0,"Etho, when trying to replicate rivers that are rocky like this, it‚Äôs important to have rocks in the river that break up the flow of the water. Often times the rocks are subsurface and the water flows over top of them which might be hard to reproduce in Minecraft but is something to consider. Rocks that jut out over the river are also very common.

A suggestion for making the rocks look good is to make sure to clearly outline each individual rock. If the shading is uniform across every rock it‚Äôll look like there are no individual rocks which is not true to real life and just generally doesn‚Äôt look as good. And of course vary the sizes of the rocks to make it look a bit more natural. In terms of moss vs no moss, typically if the river is in enclosed in the woods there will be moss on the rocks, but if the river is out in the open there usually won‚Äôt be."

0,"Important terraforming trick for rocks: Add slabs, stairs, and other non cubic blocks, and add foliage! Also, think about how the natural erosion would shape it, and add textural elements based off of that. Also I feel like the shading is way overhyped, it always looks unnatural to me and only makes sense on a very large scale. In real life rocks are not naturally shaded like that. There might be textural and colour differences but definitely not a consistent dark to light bottom to top gradient like that. Foliage helps to hide a lot of sharp changes and jank, and helps make things look more natural. It also helps to blend in with the surrounding lush nature. Hope this helps! Landscaping is like the one bit of Minecraft I'm _actually_ good at lol, so its nice to be able to chip in for once."

honestly I really liked your terraforming of the river, and that beaver dam is /amazing/. I think my one thought from my own terraforming work, is to not be afraid to let some areas be just one type of block. I noticed you sort of did layers of each block up the side of the river's edge - which also, yknow, happens irl as sediments do their thing - but I think your build style intentionally meshes really well with the scale minecraft operates at (compared to other hermits who may build bigger (ex. bdubs + scars trees, the cities vs. the armor stand mod tricks.)) so matching how minecraft lumps blocks together may help you out as you build up your skills to the more detailed terraforming other hermits do

love seeing you branch out, excited for all the exile shenanigans"

0,"Loved the video, Etho! Starting the episode by going into your base and checking out the mail makes the world feel more real and alive. I think it would be good to add different points of interest further into your house so we get to see you walk through and interact with your house more often in the episodes.
The river is looking great. No idea how to help you with the river rocks other than adding slabs and buttons. I also think you might be going a little wild with your palette, just some basic cobble and smooth stone is probably enough but always interesting to see you find your own unique solutions.
Framing the view as you leave your house with trees seems like a great idea in my mind and I'd love to see how it turns out.
Kinda crazy that building that entire ghast farm was just 2 minutes of an episode. I do love seeing a bunch of different projects in an episode but I also like more ""Hey let's try building this thing together"".

0,NEW ETHO VIDEO TODAY IS A GOOD DAY
0,"something to think about for the rocks: maybe the darker blocks can be moved up a bit? so that around the waterline, they look darker (cause the water made them wet there), and then from there it starts to become lighter. then you get more room for all the colors of the boulders above the waterline, since you can't see all that detailing when it's submerged. 

i'm not a great builder at all btw, this is just a thought i had üòÖ"

0,I think the main problem with the river is that the water might be too high? I'm not sure it just looks slightly off so maybe making the rocks taller could also work?

0,"Ohh Etho, you are so cheeky with that bit at the end xD
I love the beaver dam and the beaver is perfect, really cute and sells it despite it being such a small scale! For the rocks I do think the mossy boulder looks better than the granite, maybe because there's not a lot of other red rock in the area so it stands out a bit much, I think.
Hope you're doing well! Thanks for the video :D"

0,Hi @etho. I think the rocks work in the context of the game for why the river bends great. It also helps with the visual appeal which is the most important part. I just wanted to nerd out a little and mention that rivers will naturally bend without the need of rocks. A river that starts straight with a slight perturbation will naturally become curved overtimes. This is because a small bend will cause water to impart a force on the edge as its velocity is changed. Overtime this will erode the edge more and it will become even more exagerated. This will lead to other edges having a slight bend which will also become exagerated. So its really just time + physics = curved rivers. For more info the wikipedia page on meandering rives can explain this in more details.

0,"Hey Etho! Love your river and how it is panning out. But you said one thing that got my geology brain a thinkin'. Andersite, Diorite, and Granite are all Mafic Volcanic rock that are denser and more resistant to erosion. I suggest that at some of the river bends, you put these types of blocks into the bend and mix it with some smoothed versions to show long-time water erosion. Which is what happens to river rocks over time. They get smooth."
0,"Beaver dam,... Maybe break a block so the water spills over? Looks a little too contained as it is."
3,"Honestly a very Etho thing to do, build your shop inside the PoEPoE headquarters. Was laughing so hard! The river looks really cool and I love how you always try to give a sense of realism!"

0,Getting to watch a new Etho episode feels like a mini new year <3
0,The mossy rock rocks. Keep that rock and rock n roll.
12,"Any mention of rivers curving just puts me right back to year 5 geography, studying oxbow lakes (the curves get curvier and curvier until they curve into eachother and become straight again). I love the beavers SO MUCH! Beavers have just been reintroduced to the UK, after being extinct here for 400 years, which is pretty dam (haha) cool :)
It's also really nice to know you save fanart... as someone whos made fanart I always think its one of those things that must be a little bit weird to be on the receiving end of (or at least it would be for me). It makes me happy to know that you are both aware and appreciative of it :D"

0,"Hey etho, a few suggestions for the river i've got
Add trees growing on the sides or on top of the rocks can add more greenery 
Make the waterfall drop more steep and a single water block height because waterfalls usually came from the river's surface falling off a cliff (big waterfall)
Oh and add invisible armor stands holding a stair block for the beavers feet"
0,i love you ü•∫
0,LOVE the beaver dam!! going to be putting one in my area on my server :]
0,"Rivers also turn due to erosion, not only rocks. You can enhance the ""realism"" of the curves by creating sand deposits on the outside curve and steeper banks on the inner curve."
1,"Great video! Lots of great moments all around, I especially love the little beaver you made and the contrast of beavers living in a jungle! You did a great job with making the river look natural, and the lake being at the base of a mountain makes a lot of sense for why there would be so much water pooling there. Can't wait to see the outcome of messing with the permit office, have fun toeing the line of exile!"

0,I would definitely trade up my white teeth for stronger ones... I haven't been to the dentist in a while.
0,lmfao using the poe headquarters for your end crystal shop xD you wanted drama and you made it ! can't wait to see the result. also--i think your river and rocks are coming along really well. natural terraforming is hard but you're doing a good job. great episode as always !

0,"With the rocks at 23:00 it might help if you try to blend the rocks more, right now they look more like separate piles of resources.

0,"ah yes, another upload from Etho ""Malicious Compliance"" Slab haha"
1,"personally, id take orange teeth of they were as strong as iron, but maybe im weird üòÖüòÖ"
0,"Your rocks on your river may be to ""chunky"", too fat and too close together. It could work on some terrains, but your base main area is quite flat, so your river should somewhat reflect that instead of clashing with it. Try to make some wide rocks on the side that merge on your ground instead of a big line of balls as a border between the 2 features."
0,"Love the river, the beaver dam and the beaver!‚ù§ As mentiones by others rivers dont need a reason to meander, they just do. Riversides are often very wet, so lots of moss, ferns and foliage. Thats why the red boulder feels off(too clean). The area around rivers can be very heterogenous/patchy because the river makes some parts wetter than others (swampy). Suggestion: every good lake needs a little cattail/reed patch"

19,"Left this video playing in the background while working (because of course I can never miss an Etho upload) and hearing the phrase ""for the month of December"" had me questioning reality for a solid few seconds lol. Really puts into perspective how long the process of content creation can be. I appreciate everything you do, Etho!

P.S. Googled beaver teeth - they really are BRIGHT ORANGE oh my goodness!"
0,"maybe make the river vary in thickness for a bit more natural appearance?
and the mossy rocks look real nice in the green jungle, they make sense to be overgrown in a place so green. I also like the granit rocks cus orange and green are good color combination"
0,"Sir etho it‚Äôs about the color of the rocks, the color sort of flows like‚Ä¶sediment? What I mean is it‚Äôs meant to take the adherence of darker rock sort of slowly layering into lighter rocks. Kinda like how it would happen in rivers or lakes in real life. Also bring the deep slate deeper into the mud. I think that would help give you more room to work"

0,15:35: I think you just need some slabs and buttons and you‚Äôll like it better :)
48,"absolutely love the beaver dam. fun fact, in real life beavers are considered a keystone species, which is a species that is particularly important in maintaining their ecosystem. in simple terms, beavers make a dam, the dam makes a pond, and other species come live in that pond! when you mentioned how the dam could inspire more details like the birds nest or the fallen trees it reminded me of that. art (or minecraft build) imitates life! :D"
0,For the end crystals: Just secretly sell them in the obsidian shop. Shade-E-E style.
0,"on the dam, have you seen B'Dubs' waterfall?"
0,"i think for rocks, i agree with more ""sectioned"" as opposed to true ""random"" but you need to mix in randomness, for example a ""darker"" section is 80% deepslate and 20% tuff, then for a mediym section its 50% tuff, 25%deepslate, 25%light grey wool, and then light section is 25/75 light grey wool and tuff just for ecample. so view the regions as ""more green/red/stone"" as opposed to more granite more moss etc"

0,Finally!!!!!
0,"You should build it layers. Meaning 1) Do the base of the river, fill it and Done 2) Go back and put your rocks and shore 3) Do the beach and grassland that surrounds it.

Doing too much before you even fill is stupid."
0,"You might have already thought of this but for the sorting system if you space the chests further apart the hopper minecarts wont be right beneath the hoppers. While this increases the space, it avoids the issue you mentioned letting you run the minecarts at 5s instead of 15! As always love your videos <3"
7,"personally i think the pink rock looks better because it matches the mud pathways and the cherry leaves in the back, but both are very well balanced and look great"
0,"Rocks around river IMO are weathered above the water(adding the noise and texture with tuff on top instead of middle) and the close to river is usually washed and does not have much texture. To me the shapes are fine, but it feels like the top of rocks are not textured enough. Maybe switching the wool with the tuff/pale moss could change the feel of it. Of course it is a personal preference so build as you feel. Thank you for another fun video <3"
0,"For your first attempt at terraforming, this is really good! I believe a big problem that's making the river feel odd is that there isn't much of a transition from the landscape to the river. Also the river is mostly consistently wide and I believe variations in how wide the river is would work wonders. I would also consider variations in the sizes of boulders (possibly use the golden ratio to determine the size variations). I love how you did some of the boulders with granite. To help with the shading, I would research pixel art shading (hue shifting, limited palette + dithering, pillow shading vs. proper shading). In order to maintain vibrant colors while shading, you can adjust the hue and saturation instead of just adjusting the value. Brighter moves closer to yellow and darker moves closer to purple. Something that may help would be opening up the Minecraft textures in photoshop and doing an average blur on the textures. While you construct the boulders, use the resource pack and then turn it off when you're done."

14,"Just as a note Etho, rivers will meander even through uniform soil. The smallest perturbations to the flow of the water will over time become more pronounced, unless the river is unnaturally straight and the flow of the water if perfectly laminar, which is not possible under natural conditions, then imperfections will accumulate and cause the water to exert uneven pressure on different sides, leading to different levels of erosion, and eventual bending. The factors at play in the winding of rivers is extremely complex, there are entire careers based on learning and understanding only parts of it. Hitting a harder layer of rock or soil isn't required for a river to divert, it's not possible outside of man-made materials and maintenance for a river to flow perfectly straight, at least not for an extended period of time.

For the bever dam, it doesn't look like any water is flowing through it, the bever dams don't fully block water flowing, only partially. To make it looks like water is leaking through the dam slowly, the roots you have there can be waterlogged, at least the ones near the bottom."

Your Beaver dam blew me away on its own but then when you added the little Beaver üò¢ oh my goodness. On the subject of keeping the area scened appropriately, make sure you leave some birch trees around (custom or not). Beavers love birch! Though you seem knowledgeable about them so you probably already knew that. üòä

Side note--- Mumbo made a fortune on his end crystals in season 8. You can too!"
0,Aww a beaver dam is a lovely idea :3
0,"About the rocks: I think less would more. While I like your texturing it feels a bit odd that only at the river there are (so many) rocks. Maybe try to reduce the number of river rocks (by half?) and add one or two stray around your house?
About the reddish rock: Maybe indicate only one or two red veins in the other rocks instead making one big red rock?"
0,"The reason rivers in nature become curvy is because they flow from an incline into flatter regions.  Without the incline, the water slows down and drops sediment carried within it.  That sediment then blocks it's own flow, leading it to divert to the side.  Over time you have rivers move in a snaking motion because of that.  So a winding section would usually sit on a flat region following an incline with rushing currents."
0,Where I live is covered in beaver swamps. From the thumbnail alone I knew exactly what you were doing. Beaver dams are always downstream from a beaver swamp. Would would consider a flooded forest in your landscape? Mostly dead trees with one or two flood-tolerant willows or something?
0,Remember that you have the armorstands to play with if you want sticks and smaller stones/dirt/mud sticking out of the Beaver dam. Just a few could make a big difference. Also you could have Cleo make a Beaver if she ever find a way out of exile that is...

1,"Beaver facts!
Beavers use a substance called ‚Äúcastoreum‚Äù mixed with urine to mark their territory. Castoreum is stored in castor sacs near the anal glands. Castoreum is used in ice cream as a vanilla substitute, under the guise of ‚Äúnatural flavoring.‚Äù There is a common misconception that castoreum got its name from the myth that beavers would castrate themselves to spare their lives from hunters looking for castoreum, although castor sacs are completely different than *ahem* other things down there. The ‚Äúcastor‚Äù part of castoreum comes from the Latin word for beaver, castor. Both male and female beavers have castor sacs. Male beavers are incredibly territorial, and hunters used this to their advantage by spreading another males castoreum-urine mix in his territory. The beaver would run up and mark the territory for himself, giving the hunters easy pickings. Your welcome."

0,"Etho if you want to show off fanart, just ask the artists! They'll say no if they don't want you too, or ask you to pay, or they might be happy to have their art work shown off, but there's no harm in asking!"
5,"Etho, think again about the end crystal permit! You are entering the tim, where ender crystals could be used in fights. When advertised cleverly, you could get pretty rich from this story arc."
0,You're my number one still.
0,"I know a thing or two about hydrology, and the reason rivers and streams turn is actually simpler than that. Water wants to go downhill. Even if it's just a grain of sand in the way of a trickle of water, nothing in nature is ever going to be perfectly flat; there's always going to be  slight dip that make one spot lower than the next. and if it's flowing towards a little lower spot, the water is going to erode more of that spot, making it larger difference. So now you got a slight bend in the stream, and because if how water moves it's always going to erode the outside of the bend and deposit stuff on the inside of the turn as it loses speed. Which makes the bend more extreme and exaggerates it. So over time you end up with a river that's literally snaking it's way across the landscape by weaving back and forth.

And I'm sure nobody with care about any of that, but I find it interesting."
0,"So in the past when I had a lot of energy and free time. I'd say I was a good builder and terraformer. But after not ""training"" enough anymore my skills still improved, but the community and technics improved so exponentially that I'd say I'm just oke...

So I got better but I'd rank myself lower than I was before lol. The game and people became so good at it"
0,"imo, two block beavers are too big. and spruce blends in with the dam a little too well so it kinda just looks like more dam.

you could give em eyes if you put a blackstone button on either side of the head, though they might look pretty derpy."
1,I give those end crystals 3 days MAX üòÇ
10,"The best advice I've ever heard for trying to replicate something from the real world, ie rocks, is to look at reference.
Cuz when we think ""rock"" it's easy to imagine a gray, roundish rock, but then you look at actual boulders that line rivers, they're varied and colorful. You might even find a rock or a picture of one that you like enough to try and replicate it exactly.
Always reference, reference, reference ‚ù§"
2,You taking over scars building really makes me think someone needs to build a shopping mall and let people rent spaces for there lesser valued permits.
0,"The channel ""practical engineering"" has a good video as to why rivers are curvy, but the short version is that if a river is straight, it makes itself not straight."
0,"So if you had the darker red rocks by the water line then lighter towards the top, maybe even sandstone-ish, it would look like the tops are sunbleached. Also, if you pick your south side of the rock you can shade the rocks on more of an angle and its easier to tell where to shade when the rocks overlap. Like the north side of the boulders would be darker and mossier"
0,End Crystal shop is very Shade E-E
0,Thank you ETHO!
1,"Hey! On the topic of why rivers turn, they actually do make turns without reason. It's called meandering, a process where friction is higher on the outside of a stream, where it thus erodes more ground. This creates bigger and bigger turns until the river cuts through a weak spot."
0,Rivers also just refuse to flow in a straight line in nature. They're constantly eroding and depositing sediment that eventually causes the river to form snakey patterns.

0,"as an artist, i'm definitely in favour of youtubers showing fanart in their videos; i really appreciate how much support and appreciation doc gives to the fanartists in his community, for example. i understand the copyright concerns, but fanart is often a grey area in that sense anyway, since fanartist also don't own the intellectual rights to the things they're making art about. ultimately fanart is created as an expression of love and appreciation, and shouldn't be about monetary gain ‚Äì the best thing that can come out of fanart for an artist is building a community with people who enjoy the same thing, and having the artwork shared is a big part of that

maybe there's a way for people to indicate that they'd like their art to be shown in a video by sharing it in a specific place or with a specific caption or hashtag or something? (as long as it's not twitter, because, well, yikes)

unrelatedly, i love the beaver dam and the chunky little beaver :D as for the rocks, i like the mossy one you made, and i think you could add some interest and impurities like you said to the grey rocks by just mixing in the occasional reddish block; i think the full red rock may stand out a little too much from what is a very natural landscape"
0,"New fan here, loved all the artwork! Kinda wished i,d participate but i don't have the resources..."
2,I imagine Etho woke up yesterday to find a new BDubs video and took it as a personal challenge
0,"Etho! For the rocks bordering the river, why not do a combination of mossy and non mossy rock? Moss usually grows only where the water is, so maybe only moss-ify the parts of the rocks where they border the water, then gradually blend in the drier, more grey part of the rocks on top. Thank you for gracing us with another amazing video btw Etho!"

0,"Another river rock comment:
I would be wary of having too many rocks in your river. It looks unnatural for there to be a perfect channel bordered by rocks on both sides. You might swap out some of the rocks (especially near the house) for a ""man-made"" retaining wall, something that a human would have built to stop floods during heavy rains, or to prevent the river from meandering under the house and destroying the foundation.

As others mentioned, curves in rivers can happen without any obvious obstruction. They're also extremely liveley, and the river's path can change dramatically over seasons within its floodplain. Consider some wetland areas bordering the river (on the far side of the house? Maybe import some frogs??) to sell the ""natural"" part of the river. The river's edges are probably heavily vegetated and muddy, rather than rocky. You can find more structured ways to direct the river flow closer to the house.  

I really love the idea of this terraforming project & the fact that you're paying attention to hyrdo-logical features of the world!"
0,End Crystals can be lucrative if you A: make good farms for them and B: get people back into end-crystalling each other like they did seasooooooon 8 I think.

1,"In nature rocky rivers are usually shallow because they usually leads into a bigger falls so the water does not have much depth, so I think it would look good if you could lower the depth and maybe add some smaller rocks in the river and let the river flow instead of it being in the same level. maybe add visible rocks at levels where the water drops and make the water move around the rocks but that being said flowing water doesn't really loos too good in Minecraft so it's a loose loose situation either way.

Some rocks surrounding the river at the river level instead of being above it would look good too I think, and since you live in a jungle the surface rocks would be covered in moss which is why the mossy stone you did at the end looks good... 

Can't wait to see how this river looks finished in the future.."

13,"I think your rocks are too round, yes Etho, rocks can be too round! Veiny formations usually look more realistic and less messy. It's fine to have a few larger vertical or horizontal formations.

I find it similar to detailing, where you don't randomly add one block once in a while, but instead have veins of a certain block. I learned this from our small friend Bdubs!

Hope you are doing well, thanks for the video"

1,"10:30 the reasons rivers bend in real life is partially to do with the terrain, but also partially due to the amount of water flowing. If you have a really fast moving river it's going to erode away at the bank and push out the course of the river, and conversely if you have a slow moving river it's going to deposit a lot of the sediment it's carrying and create new terrain. So the path rivers take will tend to get longer or shorter depending on how fast the river is moving, which is related to how quickly it's going downhill and how much water it carries.

(None of this is me saying your intuition is incorrect or you should do stuff differently btw! Just commenting that there's a lot of nuance to this you might not expect! I highly recommend checking out Practical Engineering if you interested in how stuff like this works, he's got great physical demonstrations too.)"

8,"The rocks look good! The thing that makes them stand out is the contrast with the grass. Adding moss and mossy cobble will help blend, but as you decorate the landscape more the contrast be toned down. E.g. the beaver dam adds so much to the build. As you add trees, you can add roots and dirt which will help.

Edit: this will teach me to watch the whole video before commenting. The moss looks good, the granite rock too - could be a pop of colour in one area of the build!"

1,of course the canadian man would make a beaver habitat
20,"Rivers can just meander and curve due to erosion, and if they curve too much and touch a previous section, it'll straighten out where it contacted itself due to the quicker path, leaving something called an oxbow lake. It is really interesting! To go with this, rivers actually wont get bendier if there is something blocking them from eroding into a larger curve.

Edit: Also, Jake Kelton Crafts did something interesting, he used the Bdubs glass method for waterfalls mixed with redstone and piston feed tapes to animate a waterfall. Really cool idea! He also made an animated fan inspired by Mumbo's fan, which inspired Mumbo to make an animated fan funnily enough."

0,Etho and Tango uploaded?!
0,About time üòÖ
31,"River boulders: another way to think about rivers turning is there's less rock in another direction, so it's easier for the water to flow that way. This is to say you don't have to have a boulder in every corner, especially if there's no hill behind it."
0,Imo I think the river would look better if you would lower the water just one block!
0,YAY! He's returned from his Fishing trip~
838,"A tidbit of river trivia for you, Etho: in the real world, rivers become more curvy as time goes on because there is more erosion where the direction changes. This makes the curved sections even more curvy and the cycle of erosion reinforces itself."
0,grabbing my snacks!!!
467,"River's don't neccecarily need an obvious reason for making random turns, they just do that. Erosion causes the meanders in rivers to grow larger and more exaggerated, even if it started from a tiny variation."
90,"Etho rivers don't run straight most of the time. Any slight inconsistency on one side of the river - and I mean slight can cause it to bend, then the force of the water hitting that bend causes it to erode over time and thus get be died and bendier until they eventually loop back over themselves. It's pretty rare to see a river completely straight."

0,"Etho rivers just turn beacuse water carves into the soil, you don‚Äôt need boulders to explain it üòÄ"
0,3:30 So does the server version of TCG not include both new commons and rares of all the new Alter Egos? Because in the physical release you also have a rare AE who is an engineer/redstoner. I notice that prankster barrel is also missing a few other AE cards.
1,3:50 Wait hasn't Shade--E-E also got a rare Redstone type card. I run in it my HCTCGO Etho deck it's pretty solid but somewhat situational.

0,"That trail chamber set up is madness. Etho, man, what can I say? No wonder you were fishing. congrats on the achievement. I didn't know it was happening and missed it. You know you're getting old when you enter fishing comps"

0,I would not wish linking all those portals together on an enemy dang
0,"according to the minecraft wiki:    Looting has no effect in certain cases:

    Kills by tamed wolves are not affected by this enchantment, even if the target is struck first."
0,"I've always wondered how Etho managed to love Minecraft so much and after finally catching up to the video, I'm slowly understanding and incorporating Etho's point of view and I got to say, I now know why I always feel bored when playing Minecraft! Thank you!"
0,"9:45 when did they add a ""Saving World"" message?"
0,Wow huge silo spoilers woopwooop
0,"Two curious updates that will make intersting builds.

Grass now grows even away from players.  The Etho matic pop up wool farm can now be fully automated, even the crafting of shears from a chest full of iron.

There's also a silverfish powered cannon that will go well with the boat/rail system in the nether."
0,Journey before Destination. These words are accepted.
0,This was my first episode watching you  (seen Life series and a bit of hermitcraft). And I'm on my third comment. That's a good sign!
0,"Should be able to adjust the pale moss carpet to have no upward growth as well.
I like the wall climbing growth, don't come at me. I WILL defend myself (lol I won't. I won't even see your message x), but I think you should have a choice in whether your walls are clean or not, no matter what you have on your floor."
0,"Echo shards from bats is a good idea. But Mojang stopped providing us profits from animal abuse. That's what we get for enjoying games made by hippies. #savedb
Feeding bats glow berries maybe? Having them have babies that drop shards like scute.

You have to do something with that spire on the right! That's so cool! That's perfect for an evil mad scientist's lair!"
0,Oh silo is an amazing show

0,"Good to hear that, even 10 years later, Ergo is still talking about ""polishing up old projects"" in his world :p"
0,"Hey Ergo, loved the video. I just am curious, how did you get the camels to walk around sandy city? What an awesome feature"
0,"I just wanna say I love you etho I‚Äôve been watching your stuff since I was a kid obviously less so nowadays seeing as I‚Äôm 24 but I hope you continue making videos for many years to come so when the day comes that I have kids they may get to enjoy the beautiful builds you make and the mind bending red stone contraption you construct.
I think the last video I really remember watching was you making your tamagotchi Wilson lol but I know I was watching for years before that episode too lol. I think I‚Äôve been a fan of you for more than half my life now love you dude. Lol"
0,"He Etho, I was just watching the podcast episode you did with Skizz and Impulse, and you mentioned that your favorite genre of game is the roguelike! Would you ever consider doing YouTube content on games in this genre like slay the spire/balatro or do you plan on sticking to just Minecraft?"
0,"Hi Etho! This might seem out of pocket, but have you read the stormlight archive? All your journey vs destination talk has me wondering‚Ä¶
Anyway, if you haven‚Äôt, highly recommend :)"
0,"I want thirst bar and salty water. Etho, do you agree? :)"
1,"Hi, Etho, I love your videos! Congrats on the fishing win! This might be a weird question, but it's something I've been wondering since you seem to enjoy science and how things work: what do you think of quantum physics?"
0,Etho thank you for all the good memories you have made for us all this years.having the same world for over 10 years it's crazy and when I realized that you keep playing on it I got emotional man ty
0,"I found a temporary solution to the enderpearl network. A guy called Squibbles made a wireless redstone sensor that detects where the player is looking FROM ANYWHERE, and you can teleport by looking in the right direction. It will probably be patched at some point"
0,Holy crap I used to watch this series like 8 years ago and you're still going????? Kuddos to you brother.
0,"Hey man, not sure if you will see this but I've been watching since episode 1. You're content has always been a feel good time for me so thank you. I want to start clipping your stuff and add it to TikTok. Would you be fine with that? Gives you exposure and hopefully will monetize eventually for me."
0,man i started watching you in middle school and now im in my third year of college studying applied math what a ride huh
0,"Hi Etho! I am 22 going on 23 in June, and I have been watching your videos for a decade now. I started watching you when I was in 5th grade, or 12 years old. I'm a big fan and love to see that you're still posting after all this time. On that note, I have a huge ask. You are approaching episode 600 in your lets play series. I know this may not be a popular opinion BUT.... I think you should start a new world. Your current world has gotten so much love and has so many memories built into it, and I think it will always hold a place in the hearts of many of your viewers. However. Minecraft has changed SO MUCH, you have changed SO MUCH, and I would love to see how that would translate into a brand new world (maybe even a hardcore world, to make it interesting). Whatever you decide, I will watch either way, and I want to thank you for the years of entertainment and memories. Keep it up! - A long time fan"
0,what what episode?
0,"Etho u just keep amazing me. Someone, never stop this man!"
0,"Technical players build everything out of glass, even in places where it is impractical to use glass"
0,"Etho, I have been watching a lot of your videos lately, and you often put your torch on the ground in tunnels.

If you pick a constant and always place torches on the right or left of tunnels & caves you will never get lost.

I always put torches on the right when I am going ""away"" from where I started, and so I can just follow torches on my left to get back."
0,I think it really happened this time...
10,i miss him üò¢
0,"With the new Create update, any thoughts are restarting with a new season of the modded series?"

7,i miss when etho would upload once a week üòÆ‚Äçüí® honestly at this point i feel like just not watching his videos for a year just so i can actually have something to watch when i click on his channel (a WHOLE 12 VIDEOSüôÑ)
0,"Hey, etho, i started a under ground base ! I found a skeleton and zombie spawner within  16 blocks radious ! And 2 cave spider spawners within 14 blocks !! Im so hyped a mineshaft cave with a village on top ‚ù§ its not etho good, but ima make it so nice. You're my inspiration  for this new forever world ‚ù§ ive went back to ur old season 2 videos just to copy ur spawner set up with abit of adjustments  and im using the same glass style like u :)"
0,‚ù§
1,Hey Etho habe you ever played Vintage Story it is a lot like terrfirma?
0,"I think it can be satisfying to build a farm so efficient that you can get passive resources from just standing around doing nothing. But also, there's a limit to how long we can do nothing before getting bored. Lots of players in vanilla multiplayer servers that I've seen have build very efficient farms and are rich in resources. Often, they tend to get bored very fast and stop playing entirely."
1,I'm so happy that etho is still doing good and isn't like the other Minecraft youtubers now in days
0,"I thought you would've got a new update on pc since the last time you mentioned it... üò¢ I'm actually ahead. Just a tad bit, but I just bought an 5700x3d for my 2060S. I'm really surprised you haven't upgraded in all this time, and I'm really curious why. 

I would also like to mention that your channel has been dropping considerably in my feed, I really wish I saw it more often on my feed I loved watching all your old content randomly. The mini series like the CTMs and OMG challenge maps like the ones from vexel from yesteryear, I know they're not what are popular now, and they're not the same anymore, but it's always going to be a vibe just chilling and watching drognovia or the dwarves vs zombies videos. It's a shame that just because you're lowering your total output, that your channel will drop in popularity. I've watched this channel since I was 11, and I'm 26, so 15y."
0,"Does this pay the bills? Like I feel like the answer is yes, but other than maybe the members, does youtuber pay the bills at this point in time?"
1,"Etho give us another modpack Please, maybe Team Canada."
0,Wow you are still making videos :D I'm really impressed.
0,"I miss you, Etho. Hope you're doing well."
1,Does Etho still make YouTube videos or does Etho just play Minecraft fishing ü§£ü§£ü§£
0,"i haven't kept up with you much lately but i'm back and it feels like home. started playing minecraft properly again in the last few days after barely touching it for over a year. i've had the same world for 5.5 yrs, i just start over in new areas with a clear inventory when i get bored instead of doing an entirely new world. i'm keen to get caught up on what you and others are doing in the game. i know you hear this a lot, but it's crazy that i've watched you for half my life now. i found you when i was 12 or 13 and i'll be 26 in a few months. assuming google is correct, that means i'm now the age you were when i was first watching you in 2012. thank you for all of the memories :))"
0,"Wow, randomly stopped by to see if Etho was still uploading! Man is never gonna stop and still gets views, wow"
0,You are still be able to continued till this dayüòÆ
0,Been rewatching the whole series love the videos
0,Bro I used to watch you religiously years ago on Feed The Beast and Direwolf videos. At least I think those were the modpacks. How are you still making videos!
1,hi Etho! I just watched Imp and Skizzs podcast and heard you liked to read your comments! I watched your Dwarves vs Zombies videos when I was younger and I absolutely LOVED when you guys played that game-mode. I was just curious if you remember the game and if you think it will return in the future!! I tried finding a server or something that still played DvZ and theres pretty much nothing. ü•π BUT there are ssooo many people wanting the game-mode to come back and theres even people saying the Hermits could probably reignite that flame! ü§ç
0,Just installed honey block elevator in my 7k hardcore world. Thank you
3,11:50 its like when you find money in the pocket of a pair of pants or inside your phone case that you had forgotten you put there
0,"bro how ols is this world now lol, will u release another updated version of ur world?"
0,Etho made a redstonecontraption to replace Bdubs
0,"It would be fun to see you do some modded again. Perhaps on a modded server, even. Like jojosolos‚Äô TCG SMP. Idk if you could get on there though. I hear she only invites friends. ;)"
0,"quick question, what were u thinking when u chose ur skin? cause honestly it kinda reminds me of a certain anime character. Specifically kakashi from naruto. Might just be me tho."
2,"Dearest Etho!!
Do you still read every comment now that you get so many each episode? Also, what‚Äôs it like having such a large following now? Do you miss when it used to be smaller?"
0,"Hey etho! Long long time subscriber(since I was like 12 lol), just trying to get back into watching the let‚Äôs play as a go to bed series but I feel like I missed so much and every episode you fly over things I missed‚Ä¶. I know they take forever‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but when‚Äôs the next world tour?"
0,"Hey Etho, Have you gone to any conventions where you just stay in the crowd hidden and observing?"
0,"You could keep the wolves alive via lingering potions of healing dispensed and hooked up to an Etho hopper clock. Maybe four wolves in total? What do you think of Ethobot? Would you two ever do a video together or not? If you think I'm over loading you on questions, I'm not. Just wanting to have some questions answered."
0,You're almost at 1 billion total channel views. That's insane

0,"@Etho hey, i keep seeing a newer game of the mod you love called vintage story. Would love to see you play it! I have watched you since i can remember. As soon as i saw the game, I knew you would already be playing it. Would just love to see you play it."
0,this world opened 13 years ago pleaz reponde
0,Stay up big dawg!
0,"etho i had an idea idk if you would be into it. the fallout shelter project is pretty big but its a great idea; i was thinking you could interact with the fans somehow to get designs for each shelter, reddit contests or smth. select winners could get their design put in the world, a fun way to keep the spirit of a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play‚Äù"
1,Etho you know how you made a jungle base in hermit craft season 1? Well I think you should have a tradition like every ten hermit craft seasons you make a jungle base you know for memorys
0,Etho is definitely getting some
0,"Etho I've been watching your videos since I was a kid, I am BEGGING you to create a create mod world, there are so many things to do and you'd be so great at it. PLEASE."
1,"Hey etho! For the 600 episode special you should do a clip montage like the 200 episode special, I think it would be really cool to see some highlights over the years. Just an idea"
0,"i‚Äôm high asl, i can‚Äôt comprehend anything this man is doing, and i love it"
8,"Great to see you still making content, been watching you since I was a kid, I'm now 25. How time flies, hope you're doing well!"
2,"10 year later i still watch ur videos etho. thank you for decades of enjoyment. i also love the problem solving and the nostalgia of the entire world, outro was amazing cause i remember when we built that.. well u but u get the point lol <3"

0,Would be great to see Etho back in his prime

Anyways, been watching your videos since the boat dispenser era (probably 10 years ago + at this point. Love what you are doing, and hope you are all good!

Love from Norway!"
1,Ethos videos always make me feel better
0,hey Etho have you ever considered using a mod like Nvidium to get farther chunk render distance?
0,I truly love how ethos has never changed his style through the years honestly the best content creator out there! ‚ù§
0,"love too

1,"Greetings Mr. Slab!  I thought the arrows could go in the creeper face for it to shoot instead of snowballs! Would be entertaining if you got shot by your own build, enjoy the videos, keep up the amazing work"
0,"Not sure how effective it will be, but maybe layered snow can help with the wolves getting shot? And if you go the route of potions, be careful bc health and regen potions do damage to undead mobs, poison heals them"
0,My minecraft idea of the day is etho finally finishing the library entirely üòÇüòÇ
2,I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the same intro 15 years later or however long it‚Äôs been

0,"""I am batman"" -Iskall85"
0,"Etho, what is your favourite game from the Fallout series?"
0,Decorating the chambers in a fallout theme sounds really fun but its a massive task. But since this is a forever world. You could make it a seasonal event. Like fallout fall. And every year sometime in the fall you decorate one chamber. That way you slowly make progress towards it and have fun with the idea without it becoming a bottleneck. Love the videos etho ‚ù§
3,"I just learned that if you have multiple stacks of the same thing in your inventory when loading things into chests, you just have to pick up a stack, then shift click on another stack of the same thing and itll move everything available into your chest. So life changing."
0,Would the breeze farm count as an AFK farm?
0,Hey Etho. Have you checked out Balatro? It's a very addicting roguelike game that uses poker hands. It feels like your type of game since you're a roguelike fan and I'd be interested if you have played it and what your thoughts on it are.
0,You should put signs with the patch version in the nether tunnels
0,Journey before destination! Etho is a Knight Radiant.
0,I had a dream where Etho collaborated with an environmental activist and made an 8 minute minecraft asmr video building an igloo.
0,I know you probably won‚Äôt see this comment but I‚Äôd really love to see a new world tour and world download
1,"The pale garden immediately makes me think of the lost forest from the legend of zelda series of games, having something similar with puzzles and other things would be awesome."
0,"Etho I've tried your sandwich. You have impeccable taste. I use homemade sourdough instead of a baguette, but I've been digging this thing. One thing I would highly recommend is you put some olive oil on it. It really takes your 9.5/10 sandwich to a 10/10."

0,"I'm sure there's a mod for this, but it would be cool if there was a way to make a single chunk in the Nether coordinate 1:1 in the overworld, opposed to 8:1

And Etho, do you ever rewatch your old videos? If so, what's the video you've gone back to the most? Hope you're enjoying the snow!"

12,"So close to episode 600, it's crazy to think this series has been going on for over 10 years. Growing up watching every single episode evolve over time. It reminds me how crazy it is that even the biggest creator on the platform Mrbeast was a fan too in the Mindcrack days. And also an opinion on the new biome. It is interesting how they just reuse and re texture game mechanics that are already in the game. The trees are retextured dark oak, the planks are white textured oak planks, the new moss is re-textured original moss. I guess it is more of a building pallet now and now we have a larger variety for us to choose from. Anyway. Thank you for the entertainment Etho! As always, it doesn't go unappreciated."
3,"In your video ""Etho Plays Minecraft - Episode 456 Ender Ender 3 0"", the point when you name tagged the endermite happened so fast I missed it. I spawned and lost 3 endermites before rewatch the video paying more attention to that part of the video. Thanks for your detail explanations. Instead of having to go 128 block out, I made the killing chamber next to the spawn platform and slabbed inside the spawn sphere (work in progress). I am 70, my grandson got me hooked, have done several worlds, been in the current one 6782 days,"

0,"Hello Etho! I'm Maria and I'm not a big gamer myself but my partner, Ethan, is and they are a big fan of your videos. We've been together for about 3 months now but they told me they've been watching you for the longest, have watched each of your videos even. There's been times we have a meal together and watching something on the screen, but when they see a video of yours dropped they get so excited and put it on immediately. I watched this video to get more a sense of why they enjoy your videos, your chuckles are so heartwarming while talking through what you're doing to your viewers. 

For Valentine's day, I wanted to get them a more emotional and significant gift rather than just physical gifts. Anyways, I was hoping you can give a quick shoutout in the comments to Ethan? Well, Ene is their gamer tag but I think they'd be stoked to see recognition from you either way! It'd be so sick if you could, thanks for your time Etho and your videos :))"

0,"The afk vs not afking debate in survival minecraft is interesting to me. I've personally leaned into afking because I've always seen it as time shifting. Like how when VCR's first became a product that the average person can buy and use to record TV shows to watch later, most people that have them leaned into the habit of recording shows to watch later. As a veteran survival minecraft player, and redstoner, I've just gotten into the desire, and habit of just building the most efficient, some might even call them OP, and afkable farm designs that I can find and calling it done. But seeing the ways that other people play the game has been an eye opener to me. 

Why I compare afking at farms in minecraft to tapeing TV shows is it enables a playstyle of being able to freely get resources for large projects, allow me to spend the time I'd otherwise have to spend grinding for resources ingame, playing other games, doing other things at my computer or even doing IRL things like chores and cooking food while my farm in my minecraft world makes resources for me. And then a few hours to maybe even a few days later, I have all the resources I need for my mega project and then some. 

I do understand why some people see afking as taking the fun and joy out of gathering resources yourself, or at least operating a farm yourself ingame and interacting with it rather than just letting it run in the background. This is the beauty of minecraft, in that there really is no ""wrong"" way to do things, everyone has a diff playstyle that is unique to only themselves and their personal values.

Me from 5 years ago would have scoffed at Etho's no afking rule and made fun of it, but today I totally see that everyone plays the game differently and why they play it differently, and I'd frankly find the world to be boring if every single minecraft player have my exact same playstyle."
1,I like the energy of this episode
0,Hey Etho have you heard about Cobblemon? The new pokemon minecraft mod. I loved your pixelmon series would you consider doing another pokemon series in Cobblemon?

0,"Hey Etho! I‚Äôve been studying to become a lawyer for a little bit, and the case United States v. Kane was suggested to me. In it, two men exploited a software error on digital slot machines to win half a million dollars. Two points were paramount: whether the slot machine constituted a ‚Äúprotected computer‚Äù under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and whether the men had ‚Äúexceeded authorized access.‚Äù The court ruled that, although it was a protected computer, the men had simply pressed buttons in a way they were legally entitled to do, and they kept the money. Moral of the story, you should definitely be allowed to exploit bugs for your vanilla playthrough. It didn't come up in this video, but it has before. On the other hand, if exploiting a bug ruins your fun, don't do it. That would defeat the purpose of the playthrough for everyone. Keep up the good work!"
0,U could do a segment on your next world tour (probably ep 600 like u said) where u read old comments of the day

Its a great game that I think you would enjoy playing (and us watching you play) since you loved TerraFirmaCraft way back in the day."

But I've also been watching the latest couple of episodes -- the difference in his voice and delivery is amazing! And of course the game has changed a LOT since 2012. It's been ~12 years since ep 204 and you can really tell. Both versions of Etho are super entertaining though!"
0,"Comment of the day, cotd, Etho with us switching to the age of ai (artificial intelligence) how have you used ai apart of your YouTube career?

I know you had some issues with it before as your game crashed and stopped working etc. But just curious as i'm someone who never really plays modded but seeing all the stuff was always super fun and interesting"

0,"Hey Etho, have you ever had problems with RSI? One vacation I played Minecraft for 8 (or probably longer) hours per day, four days in a row, and by then my (mouse hand) wrist started hurting. It went away again by the end of the week, but I learned my lesson to keep it in moderation. Is maybe your unique mouse placement a factor to prevent/avoid this issue? Or maybe your joints just aren't predisposed to this. Stay healthy : )"

I just live in boxes underground to hide my shame."

Or maybe you could just play with line of sight - place a trap door above the dogs or something like that?"

I don't really care bout MC anymore. Ahhh"
0,"Hey Etho, I know you like to do the hour and a half world tours to celebrate x00 or x50 episode milestones, but for episode 600 or for a special episode, I would love to see a multi hour full in depth tour of EVERYTHING in the world you can remember doing.  I've been watching the series for around 12/13 years and world tours are always a favorite of mine to watch. I like the brief summaries of your creation's reason for existing,  its use case, and then why mojang broke your build or why you moved onto something better. I know that a lot of people might not want to sit through an episode this long which is why it might not be worth making, but I hope you can make this happen. 

Also, I do like the idea of returning to a video style where you maybe work on 2/3 fun small projects in a video rather than 1 really large project per episode."

0,This is crazy cool!
0,Nice to see Etho interacting with his fellow weeping angels.
0,"22:00 - Bundles have also been growing on me. Since your last episode I've been doing a similar thing in my inventory. A trash bag for random items, plus a ""Day Bag"" for my useful stuff like Ender Chests, Scaffolding, a couple of Chests, an Anvil, Furnace, other bits.

I've also taken out one slot in each of the Shulkers in my Ender Chest system and put a bundle in there for the 'off cuts' for when I'm building things. Any leftover sticks, stairs, slabs, etc go into their related bin bag and I can just dig through there quickly before crafting more stairs or whatever on my next project."

0,"Been watching Silo with friends who have the Apple TV service -- one or two episodes per visit, so it's slow going lol.  It's so good.  Gotta say it's also refreshing that it's not a YA thing for a change.

At least multiple trial chambers means that decoration naturally breaks out into chunks (no pun intended).  That way it's a lot of little projects that can be done between other things as time, inclination, and inspiration allow."

Do you ever regret making your world amplified. It always looks nice, but can be a bit extreme for building some times. Also with new generation changes, it doesn‚Äôt allow for some designed spaces, like the groves"

68,"*NOTE:* The following is from a mod-developer point-of-view; I have no idea what goes on in Mojang's offices. I just know what I've seen of their code.
23:00 - To be fair to Mojang, the Server (where the Sculk lives) doesn't know about a good chunk of sounds that happen. Even when playing in a Singleplayer world, the Logical Server doesn't know when most _sounds_ get played; so therefore, neither does the Sculk. Instead, Sculk works off an Event-based system. That's the list of signal strengths Etho mentions.

This is done for performance and simplicity; for example - footsteps. Sending _every_ footstep sound event over the network _every_ time a mob moves to _every_ player in range would take up a ton of bandwidth _and_ would require that the server check who is in range to try and minimize the bandwidth cost (which can be a fairly taxing calculation.)
Instead, the client handles sounds, for the most part. When it gets an update from the server saying ""this mob within your entity distance moved enough for me to tell you about it"" the client goes ""ok cool"" and rolls a random chance to play a footstep sound, so long as the mob is within range. (And like a billion other things but they're not relevant.)

This has drawbacks, obviously, but is the best of both worlds - you get footstep sounds when mobs move, and the server doesn't have to manage it. The drawbacks in comparison are well worth it, from a developer's point of view:
1. Sounds that ARE synchronized that have random variants (a very small and avoidable group) aren't guaranteed to be the same between players (oh no.. anyways)
2. Things that live purely on the Server have no way of knowing what or when sounds are played. (The problem we've encountered)

Heck, things that live on the Client can also have a hard time knowing exactly what sound is _currently_ playing at any given time, due to how sounds themselves are triggered and then just left to their own devices. Though, that's more of a ""how computers tend to handle sound"" issue than an implementation issue."
1,I love the fallout/Silo idea!
1,"If you're getting so many arrows, why not use the arrows to kill them?"
3,"26:20 Mojang is pretty hardset on not adding new ""animals"" with drops or adding drops to existing mobs that represent animals because they don't want to promote animal cruelty. We may see something like this in a future mob that doesn't reflect a real life animal, but it's unlikely it'll ever happen with bats and that they will remain useless forever unfortunately."

0,I‚Äôve been rewatching your entire lp series and I just saw where you had a list of projects that need finished and you would either pick one for the episode or let the viewers pick. That would be a good way to implement finishing the smaller projects!
0,"Question : How do you feel about the different types of animals (chickens, cow, and pig) they are adding to the game? As far as I know they add no other purpose other than basically being decoration as far as I know. They are also adding new desert updates (Cactus and the desert grass). Do you feel like Minecraft is getting repetitive adding different types (like they did for Dogs) or do you think it's good?"
0,"hi etho! Its great to hear you're thinking of moving back to smaller projects and finishing touches. Of course the big projects are cool, but some of my favorite bits from the last few episodes has been your work on your world's infrastructure!

0,"I've never thought of afk-ing like that before, and you are so right! I tend to make my farms very spread out, but if I must be present while the farms are running I am more likely to build around them and decorate them."
0,"If you have a good supply of scute from armadillos, you could use Wolf Armor to protect the wolves and set up a calibrated skulk sensor to detect when the armor breaks, using a piston to lower the dog, sadly you can't dispense wolf armor onto the wolf. Maybe have either just 1 Dog on either side with wool between them and bounce the dogs side to side with it set that if the armor breaks, it pushes the dog into a safe spot and maybe have a few backup dogs ready to replace them.
Also you can enchant the wolf armor with things like Unbreaking and Protection, though I guess prot doesn't really matter since the armor blocks all damage anyways."
0,"Slightly too fast to reach a few of those stops, might have to move the booster rails a little if it consistantly ends up ahead of the spawn timer, but the last 10% always takes 90% of the time."

Using the redstone lectern comparator control book to also list what signals the sculk sensor responds to at each level is brilliant! The pale garden looks incredible in your amplified terrain world, I love how the sky changed colour as you flew up into it and then revealed just how massive it is!!

For example, connect all the areas in your world with them and this way, you made an epic ride."
0,"Regarding the AFK rule logic mentioned in this episode:  You could say the same thing about any fully automated farm.  I build a chicken farm, and suddenly I have zero worries about food.  Seems like that disrupts resource management just as much as AFK.  You could just look at it like another difficulty setting.  We could all play hardcore with no farms if we wanted to."

From the ship, you'd get a great view of the terrain and atmosphere."

0,"It all comes down to what you enjoy in a game.
Sandbox games like minecraft are best when they allow you to focus on what you enjoy doing and forget or minimize the things you don't.
I like the survival aspects - having to deal with mobs, scaffolding, no flight, getting better gear to survive easier, getting resources and building automatic farms, recently mainly small ones that will only produce necessary amounts when Im around them, and then moderately easily collecting the resources for builds I focus on. I sometimes afk at the farms if they doesnt keep up with what im doing and/or I have other things to do and I can leave mc running in the background. Saying ""I should just play creative"" doesnt really make much sense, survival with afk isn't nearly comparable to creative.
It's like saying if someone likes Ice cream they should just eat snow instead, it has less sugar. You can do either, but only the ""framework"" is the same, and the things that make you choose one over the other are probably what matter most to the people doing it. I like the hustle of building an automatic farm, like the games factorio and satisfactory, it's satisfying to BUILD something that then makes your life easier, that does something automatically, and seeing it work. Especially things that turns the task you enjoy least, which may normally a long boring process, and instead you can just open a chest for a hit of dopamine as you see your time investment into the farm paying off, feel the relief of not having to do that thing and instead you have time to do things you enjoy most.
And then there's the concept of ""improvement"" even in respect to a farm. For me the best improvement for farms is making them smaller, lighter, easier to build, reliable. If they can be small enough to run when Im in the main base, that's a massive bonus. I never cared much about massive farms, they're cool to watch but pretty much useless unless you play on a big server where many people can make use of it. the hours spent on building and travelling to a massive farm will literally never pay off in time spent over a farm you could build in 10min you can keep in your base if the latter will satisfy your needs."

0,"I really like your trial chamber decoration idea - as you were traveling through i was thinking how cool the chamber layout is, it would be good if you could preserve that somewhat whilst making it look more polished and complete. It would take a while, but because there are multiple trial chambers (and connecting nether tunnels) it would be easy to separate it into multiple smaller tasks e.g. work on getting one chamber looking nice, then leave it for a while and do something else.

I agree with the bat drop idea, I think that whilst adding late-game content is great, some players (me lol) just don't really want to do those things, and it would be nice if there was another way to get some of the useful items without devaluing the effort required. 

Also congrats on becoming the #1 MMCI fishing champion!"

5,Important info about wolves for you etho: I did some digging in the Minecraft bug tracker and can confirm wolves will only attack skeletons when the skeleton can see (and therefore will shoot at) the wolf. This was reported as a bug in issue MC-148047 but is unresolved for ages so probably it's intended behaviour. The bug even shows a similar setup of wolves in mine carts not attacking a skeleton who's line of sight is blocked. I think you're going to have to come up with some engineered solution unfortunately.

Terraria also has items stacking to 9,999... and minecraft... needs you to place ender chests down, then get the Shulker Box place that down, get what you need, then break the box, put it back in the ender chest, and likely use a Silk Touch Pickaxe to clean up your fetch quest. it's worse than before the piggy bank got the Money Trough in Terraria."

0,"Referring to the comment of the day, I think you have to bare in mind that the majority of players don't have the luxury of playing minecraft as a Job. A lot of us have very limited time to play after school/ work when we just want to chill for a bit. 

If we didn't AFK at farms to gather resources then we'd be spending most of our limited gaming time manually gathering resources or manually using farms. 

I will build AFK farms for most items and then do an overnight AFK session to stock up on that item. So the next time I need a lot of it for a project I can just collect it and go, rather than having to spend IRL days manually gathering it. I don't often disagree with you but I don't agree with the ""you may as well play creative"" comment. We are still putting in the time, effort and resources to build these farms to get the desired resources back."
0,"I don't quite agree with the comments on the sculk sensor. You can actually sort of record the sound you want to detect. Place a sculk sensor, a comparator, and some redstone and see how much redstone turns on when making a sound. Then you know the signal strength you need to use and doesn't require you to look anything up. I think this is a better approach, because now you have to only do this once per sound. Otherwise, if you made a large build with many calibrated sculk sensors, you'd have to record the same sounds many times, which would probably get annoying pretty quickly. Now you just do it once per sound, write down the strength level, and set all your calibrated sculk sensors to that level."
0,"Classic Etho stops uploading because he got addicted to some game. As much as I love the episodes, I wouldn't have it any other way."
0,"Speaking of Minecraft ideas; I really wish they would add a redstone component that acts like a dropper, but it dispenses items automatically, at the same rate as a hopper. If it faces a block with an inventory it dispenses items it's holding into that and if it's air, then it dispenses items into the world. Name it funnel.

I think adding such a redstone component would help a lot with lag issues that conventional hopper lines create, while also (in my mind) be a cheaper alternative. You can just create a series of funnels that face each other to get the same effect as a hopper line. Mind you hoppers will remain useful for picking up items, the funnel will just be superior at transporting items."
0,"IMHO using a farm while AFK doesn't really disincentivize better farms, since AFK time is time you cannot use to actually play the game. And in a way, that 12 trial chamber ""roller coaster"" is an AFK farm, too. Maybe not infinite AFK, but you sit in the cart and then wait 6-7 minutes until you reach the end, then you drink the ominous bottle and go back for another 6-7 minutes of not having to interact with the game.
To make your waiting time worth it, you chained together multiple trial chambers. Similarly, to make your AFK time worth with an auto-clicker (i.e. to not have to keep your computer running all night) one might build a more efficient mob farm, or crop farm, etc.
At least that's my way of playing - spend the time on designing farms and other contraptions, collecting the resources, and building them. I find manual resource grind to be the most annoying part of the game, and especially dislike the early game due to that."

0,I love how Etho is on a sort of training arc. I do admittedly kinda miss when Etho was cracked at competitive Minecraft stuff and can't wait to see what's waiting for us. The old sensei is ready to reclaim the throne! Washed up no longer!
0,oh man that sleepy time bell will be an amazing gift for Bdubs OO he can build a tower for it and everything lol
0,"big projects are honestly perfect for streams, even if you talk once an hour there's so many people who would just watch your thought process, id watch a 2 week uncut video of you building this trial chamber farm"
1,omg what a cerebral way of understing the skulk sensor!
0,"Okay did anybody else get ""the hockey song"" reference here? not the stomping tom song, the other hockey song?"
0,"The quick intro in the old fishing shack really made me wish you explored/used old builds more. Maybe even just for short intro skits. I still remember when you first built that fishing area, and its so nice to see it again, like an old friend.

edit: that night time song... man I love that. Nostalgiaaaa"
0,The Breezes killing the pigmen gave me an idea: a breeze powered mob farm! Sending mobs flying would be hilarious!
0,Do a new modpack
0,Was looking for a vid last night and then he post today
0,I played the video backwards so I could watch the return trip anyways!
0,"Hey etho, I‚Äôm not happy with how my world looks and I want to start a new world. What do you do when you have put so much time into a project that you aren‚Äôt happy with the result"
0,"Etho, trivia question: Who invented the word Headbucket :)
Anyway, like you said, the 600th episode is approaching, soon we will see if you have created something special for your friends and fans and subscribers!"
0,"The best way to get wolves to attack skeletons, but have the skeleton not attack the wolf, is having the wolf inside scaffolding directly under the skeleton's feet. Because scaffolding is one way, the wolf can see the skeleton, but the skeleton can't see the wolf."
0,"15:03 99% sure looting doesn't apply when your wolves kill a mob. The only automatic looting there is, is giving foxes a looting sword. But they will only attack small animals."

0,Create a system whereby you can breed dogs and just flip a lever to take one of the dogs you've bred and it just automatically replaces the dead one?
0,You really need to get back on the Hermitcraft server. Poor Scar is desperate to find somebody to talk about Silo with. ;D
1,Happy to hear Etho mention no Freecam and that the world has always been pure vanilla. Large creators are getting lazy and straying from pure Vanilla for their mega projects and sadly get much more views and have great influence
1,MAYBE finish old projects
0,Absolutely insane to build this big of a trial chamber farm. Can't believe the amount of work it took to get this many portals linked up
2,That is an incredibly cool project
0,Super excited about the idea of polishing some stuff for the next couple episodes!!!
0,Who are you?
0,Can someone explain the fishing thing?
0,LMAO HE NNEVER STOPS FISHING
0,üëÄThat Sculk Sensor book is something I need in my life as well. So helpful!
0,6:45 You should make this into a fun-ride. Decorated with ghosts or something and stuft happening
0,The trading song. Its f-zero
0,"Just got some new headphones after an old pair became too broken to use. Tried 'em out for the first time with Etho for... ya know, tradition."
0,"GUYS I HAD AN IDEA WITH A CAPITAL ""I"" AT THE BEGINNING!!! What if we use the creeking instead of an armorstand in a killing chamber? Faster hits without worrying about loosing the hit spot.

Edit: to keep the creeking just keep the creeking heart close to it and put a nametag on him."
0,NOTICE ME ETHO SENPAIIIIIII
0,I was WAY more excited than I should have been to hear the fishing song return
1,"A new Modpack would be really interesting, great episode !"
0,hey etho! ive been watching you since i was 6 and im 18 now. thats crazy!!
0,I made a wolf based skele farm a long time ago. But it's very tricky to get the wolves to attack the skeles without the skeles being able to shoot the wolves.
0,I haven't seen that fishing hut in so long! Nostalgic gut punch!
0,"I do genuinely love using my bundles. I do the same where I have a slot for stuff I collect, and then have a bag of utility items, for crafting, building etc, a great way to always carry those must haves without sacrificing space."
0,This let's play series is singlehandedly keeping my childhood alive :)
0,I don‚Äôt think you have ever had another player on your let‚Äôs play. What if for world tour or something you do some clever networking and Vlan a guest to do it with?
0,Hello! Maybe Half Life theme for the ride from the into of the first game?
0,honk.
0,"26:05 In the vanilla skyblock mod I'm playing (CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn), bats do drop echo shards! But only when killed by a warden. It's a pretty fun mechanic, but if you're trying to help players avoid the scary stuff, I can see why you wouldn't want wardens involved. üòÖ It's fine in a mostly vanilla skyblock mod though when there's literally no other way to get the echo shards, and you can control exactly where wardens and bats spawn."
0,"With an impending world tour video, would you consider including a hermit tours segment?"
0,"Always thought they could do something more with the mushrooms in the game. A mushroom block that you could craft, new type of food, mushroom leather and maybe a bundle made out of mushroom leather which could hold all your tools."
0,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been said before but Etho is the Bob Ross of Minecraft.
0,FEEESHIN
0,"Hye Etho! Really love the effort and quality, but just so you know, you can occasionally upload some chill, relaxing mini episodes. Not all episodes have to be top notch. Your viewers would appreciate your uploads. 

I like the fact that you kept a 7 minute uncut section of the trial chambers. In today's time where everything is constantly stimulating, it felt nice to have a break. I didn't even notice until 5:30 in it."
0,Etho build gothem city in the pale forest
0,Stop it all!!!! Etho dropped a new video.
0,It is absolutely insane how much of my life this series has been a part of. Love you etho
0,Hey Etho i was wondering since you've been playing for so long what is the build/project you're the most proud of?
0,i would love smaller projects!
0,We should call it comment of the month at this point
0,Did you consider streaming the fishing game? I think it would be a fun thing to watch! In the past you were online a couple of times on Twitch (no I'm not old) but never followed up on that. Any specific reason?
0,Fishing! [Insert pufferfish eating carrot sound effect here]
1,10:25 I‚Äôm having deja vu
4,Not trying to backseat but it's really funny that Etho created a whole system for keeping track of Skulk sensor data that could be solved with a couple of post-its on his desk lmao
0,Ethoe how did you get the llamas to fish around the sandy city like that
0,"Now I realise that when Etho triggered Bdubs' horse tnt trap thing. He knew exactly what he was doing. It wasn't an accident, this sneaky guy."
0,thank you for another video Etho. i  always appreciate you on my feed
0,Woah I thought I was watching a old video of yours when you did the fishing bit. That was a blast from the past. :)
0,JOE ITS ME!
0,Etho has seen/read Silo! Such a great series
0,Really like the idea of decorating the chambers with different themes. Maybe 1 or 2 of can also be decorated as a call-back to some of the past series like one can be done in the theme of Crashed Landing
1,"Etho! Have you read the Silo book series? The books are even better than the already great show. I seriously recommend them, the first book is called Wool by Hugh Howey"
0,Silo is so good
0,Aw snappers
0,"WHATS YOUR OPINION ON SEVERANCE SEASON 2?! sorry, finding out you watch silo was very cool (i just finished the second season in apple)"
0,"Etho, you have entertained me for 12 years since I was a kid. I am no longer a kid now and can afford to pay for the entertainment you have provided and continue to provide, but you make it very clear you do not need/ want money. What is a better way of paying you back for all these years?"
0,Someday ethos world tour will be over 10 hours long and i will have great sleep for many moons
0,"Dear etho, what are some of your favorite video games besides Minecraft? Or I guess I should ask how often you are able to play other games as well, I‚Äôve always been curious, I know you‚Äôve mentioned others and of course I‚Äôve seen you play others. For instance I feel like you would enjoy hollow knight. I personally have been playing a lot of baulders gate 3 as well as hades. Anyways just thought I‚Äôd ask. 

I hope you or anyone reading this are staying warm this winter and having a good day. I‚Äôm about to get 5-10 inches of snow and will be taking my dogs out on the frozen lake to enjoy it. Then I guess I‚Äôll have to shovel."
0,I see etho I watch etho
30,"Etho, I think I speak for most of us when I say that if you ever start feeling bored of Minecraft or find it harder to post due to burnout, you can always create videos of other games or even a podcast, and we‚Äôd love it. Most of us are here for you‚Äîthe gameplay is just a bonus. The main content we enjoy is you, not just the game."
0,It's 2025 and Etho is still talking about finishing up old projects instead of starting new ones üò≠üò≠
0,well this is insane

0,Can you build like a fight ring where the mobs that fight each other can have a battle?
0,"Let‚Äôs go etho let‚Äôs go, let‚Äôs go etho, let‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs go etho let‚Äôs go. Time to grab my snacks."

0,Great episode
0,"Please decorate the track Etho, your idea is so good!"
23,"Etho disappearing for a while and  becoming top fisher is such an etho thing to do. I love it, glad you've returned from your fishing trip!"
0,Are you going to pass this world down to your children?
0,You've got to do the Etho's challenge some time Etho. !!!
0,Oh snapperz here we go
0,:D
0,"Apocalypse shelters underground in the trail chambers is a really cool idea! I'd love to see a ruined one with a fungus takeover as some failed ""mushroom farm"" shelter. Getting the villagers down there sounds painful though!! Great to see u back!!"
0,"Thank you Etho, I needed this today"
0,For the dogs taking damage maybe if there was a way to detect if/when the take damage you would have a time-based dispenser block that is just far away from hitting the skeletons and other mobs that it dispenses a low-grade regen potion or you could have something similar but at the top where the initial drop off point for the skeletons you could have a dispenser on a time-clock that dispenses a weakening potion or something like that. It may look out of place or unnatural/janky but I think it could do the job.
0,Been a while since I've seen an Etho LP episode. Glad I clicked on this one.
0,"Y'know, I've never been one to get snacks for Etho vids because I've never been much of a snacks person. But I've been more of a snacks person lately, I should start getting snacks for the etho vids."
0,"Bundles didn‚Äôt change the game, but they definitely changed how I play. Big fan!"
0,Those dark oak and pale garden biomes have some of the coolest terrain I've seen in vanilla.
0,Is this world hosted on a dedicated server? Or are cheats enabled to get the portals to have zero delay with a gamerule?
0,Your idea of a factory in the new biome reminds me of your steampunk base in one of your older modded series. It was even built in a mountainous area if I remember correctly.
0,12 different trial chambers like 12 districts in the hunger games?
0,"I think you can hold a looting sword in the main hand and explosive rockets in the off-hand. Then, you could spam rockets into the killing chambers for the looting effect on the skeles and the breezes. Not sure how practical this killing method is, but I have yet to see another big YouTuber take advantage of this method... not to mention that you seem like the type of person to try these new and quirky things."
0,the vault/colonies idea for the trial chamber farm sounds awesome
0,"Etho, do you like the Leafs?"
1,Please post a video about your journey to number 1 fisher üôèüòÇ

0,Etho! Pls play vintage story. It‚Äôs like Terrafirmacraft but so much more fun!
0,8:15 for the decorations what about the metro series of games? Seems pretty perfect to combine a nuclear / post apocalyptic setting with the train tracks you already have running through the area

0,eeeeeeeffoooooo!
0,"Oh, how missed this :D"
2,"Honestly, when I heard you talking about Bundles I thought of inventory issues, how they could fix it and that took me back to Minecraft Dungeons. They are so useless - aside from Spawners, but let's be honest you use them maybe once early and then you have a monster farm - and it's mindblowing they didn't get an overhaul with the caves update. They don't even need to go far with it, just add some unique items that you actually want to look for - and hey, there is a game that already shows what can be done: Terraria. Magic Mirror to teleport back to spawn/bed? I always install a mod just to set a single home I teleport back to. And these could include unique items you can equip that give you an effect, e.g. secondary armor slots (helmet, chest, legs, boots) where you can put in one effect. One could be more movement speed or ramping movement speed, Elytra get moved to it as well for the chest. The helmet could have interesting effects like night vision, ore tracking (nothing special, just like a 3-5 block distance that reveals Ores for you, toggled via hotkey). Legs idk, point is less to come up with ideas and more to say that these items could be in the Dungeons and you can have multiple per slot, but only 1 can be equipped. It's honestly a bit sad to think of just how old something that could be so exciting is and that they barely received an update ever."

I love the bigger projects too, its great to see you flex your intelligence and knowledge of game mechanics and see just what you can do with that but sometimes slowing it down can be just as fun! Congrats on #1 btw!"

0,elybeat maker fishing song now
0,I don't like this overly eccentric etho
0,i still maintain the skulk sensor should have been done exactly like noteblocks. you could have easily had a signal for every aspect of mc using 15 redstone levels and a few select blocks underneath the sensor
0,Etho gives me software dev vibes
0,"You can fish if you want to, you can leave your worlds behind"
1,missed u etho
0,"Hey Etho! 


And always loved your world and the cave system you made, however i noticed that with every 100 episodes you do a world tour and upload your world file. With consoles now keeping up on updates with PC, is there a possibility that we will see your world come to bedrock for us fans who aren‚Äôt interested or unable to go the PC route ? 

Been a fan since the OG TNT Olympics. Keep crushing it!"
0,This is the most amazing thing I have seen in my hole 12mc year life nice bro
0,It would be cool if beacons affected owned animals. Wolves + regen + skeleton farm
0,"Hey Etho! Regarding the dogs for the Trial Chamber farm, since you mentioned the Sculk Sensors in the video, maybe it would be possible to have regen potions activated by an entity damage Sculk just out of range of the skeletons. I'm not very familiar with the Sculk Sensor mechanics, but if the dogs are the only entities within range then that seems like a potential way of doing automatic healing."
0,I like the sound of smaller projects! Seems like fun! Congrats on almost 600 episodes.
0,"Ep. 600 means tidying up and finishing projects, very exciting!"
1,"I'm straight, but Etho is so darn cute ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,"I am actually looking forward to smaller projects and a few new unfinished projects. I like the most the clever ideas. For example mastermind. First episode was a blast, fourth was already too technical for me. And this episode was great. I liked the energy to make it and put it out, not everything has to be perfect."

3,25:30 Etho looking for an excuse to kill more bats.
0,"Comment of the Day submission: Etho, have you seen AboutOliver‚Äôs blind play through of Minecraft? It‚Äôs a fascinating case study of seeing someone work naturally through the game‚Äôs progression without any outside input. Do you have any thoughts about the game‚Äôs progression now compared to how when you first were figuring things out and what you might change?"
1,"I‚Äôm not going to lie, this EP episode was a bit disappointing. I understand the juggling of the monotone building vs keeping attention, but I do miss the videos from years ago showing how you work things out. This episode felt more of like ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a recap of what I‚Äôve done + 10 min of pale garden stuff‚Äù which I‚Äôm not a fan of. Not that you‚Äôd ever be equivalent to this, but it seems a lot like the Minecraft content that is churned out today that never shows the process, just the outcome. 


Not meant to hate, I‚Äôve loved you for over 10 years, but I hope you can see this feedback and see if you can incorporate more of that into your videos."
0,The skulk sensor book is genius
1,"long time viewer here and not just you, been watching  Bdubs, Docm77 and all the others. Last week doc streamed some of the fishing on mcc and I decided to give it a try having never played anything but vanilla. After what I thought would be half hour of play, I ended up playing 7 hours, its so much fun and I just wanted to say how impressed I am about your involvement. Love that you are posting some content on ye old youtube channel, but I hope you keep it up Etho, don't give up the fishing :)"
0,Small projects where you're building around the world sounds cool! Would love to see some work around spawn :) especially for the world download in 10 episodes

1,"30:50 this segment just reminds me how unintuitive the tree growing mechanics are in this game, they should really make it so that if a sapling can't grow into a tree (due to either not having enough space, or not having enough saplings if it's dark/pale oak) you don't waste bone meal on it"

0,"Hey Mr. Fisherman, I would love some episodes of you just going around your world doing random odds and ends!"
0,"two things.
1: totally agree with that reasoning behind your no afk philosophy, personally i don't really play survival because of how many ways it doesn't really engage me? doesn't hook me in as much as other games like minecraft (also setting up a server is annoying unlike terraria or core keeper or whatever) so i just play creative... but i totally understand not wanting to take the easy way out- But personally, i've tried playing a half/half survival and creative type thing before, where i either have a timer or otherwise a Limit on how much i can do with creative (like sacrificing a diamond block for command blocks, stuff like that) and that Really helps with just how Grindy minecraft can be, sure most players are used to the grind but when everyone's mining trips are measured in *hours* that's not exactly indicative of the Casual players's experiences... and i think that makes it so about half of those billions of sales of minecraft just go unplayed because ""i don't want to have to strip mine or go caving for 8 hours to get items i'm not even guaranteed to keep"" is seemingly an uncommon sentiment among the online minecraft community? i really don't understand why not but apparently people would rather come home from their jobs and work a second smaller digital job in order to get good stuff rather than it being Slightly easier...

and 2 (preface: i have 11k hours in terraria. please understand that i've enjoyed all eleven thousand of those hours thouroughly, i don't have a play-time for minecraft but most of it was probably spent playing minigames on servers): i have an observation about sandbox games that has made me realize why survival minecraft struggles to keep me engaged (or lure me in in the first place), minecraft doesn't have fun.
or at least, when it has fun it's usually extremely time intensive, literally just text, or so niche most people won't ever find it naturally, such as playing music for parrots making them dance, the splash screen text, or evokers changing red sheep to blue.
minecraft doesn't have unique items that drop from enemies rarely (like the bat bat in terraria, or the mushroom cap in core keeper, or figurines in starbound), or *silly*, *whimsical* things you can stumble upon or find in chests (like in terraria how the golfer found golfing in the desert, or how you can fish up a joja cola and get a Stardrop from Purifying it- i'll get back to this), minecraft has funny languages! and text!!! but funny items? play something else i guess.
and don't even get me started on the Crossover stuff minecraft *doesn't do*, like i get that they have the marketplace on bedrock edition so they can just relegate all the crossovers to that, but Steve got in SUPER SMASH BROTHERS and there's not even a PAINTING ABOUT IT?
minecraft is owned by microsoft and there's no allusion to masterchief, there's no x box, no bethesda *Anything*, it's like minecraft has a clause in every crossover that it is *one way*- except on bedrock- they'll loan out steve sure, but putting even a *hint* of another intellectual property in the vanilla game (and not an april fools joke) is some Horrible suggestion that would lose them money or something. even though they're minecraft and even making the slimes blue and drop ""gel"" for halloween would make people cry tears of joy.
but i digress, minecraft simply has no fun- UNLIKE TERRARIA, which has a WIKI PAGE'S WORTH of crossover content, edge of space, worms 3 (in the mobile version, but still), the dungeon defenders 2 is practically INTEGRAL to the game's progression, you can get a CREEPER COSTUME- they crossed over, with a *YOYO MANUFACTURER*. they also crossed over with stardew valley, core keeper, don't starve, and there's plans for dead cells and pal world... but maybe that's just a terraria thing, maybe they're more okay with getting a little silly with it.
i think if minecraft wants to bring in new casual players, instead of making the game prettier or adding another shade of gray to be used in the world's longest gray-dient, they should get silly with it, add rare cosmetic items that drop from enemies, add rare loot that has literally no function *like the spyglass!!! do more spyglass-like things but sillier!!!*

to summarize: no-afk rule good, minecraft is insanely grindy and everyone seems to ignore this, and mojang has no fun but they Really should."
7,I don't know why but it makes me so happy that Etho watched Silo. I love the show and the books!

0,"I agree that I‚Äôd love to see more small building projects. Specifically, if you could make your end portal rooms look nice, that would be so cool. (I don‚Äôt mean the stronghold base. I think that‚Äôs fine being a historical monument like Emerald City. I mean the portal room itself:)"

6,Hi Etho! I have been watching your old UHC videos (they are amazing! especially the teams lol) and it's crazy how different they are from the stuff you make now. I've only been watching you for about a year now so it's crazy to go back twelve whole years and see a younger you. I love seeing how much more confidence and energy you put into your current videos. keep being awesome!

0,"Regarding the afk topic, I feel like I take much more pride and joy in designing my own not so efficient and buggy farm and then afk in it than copying someomes' OP design that allows me to gather the same amount of ressources in 10 min to avoid afk, but I guess it's up to everyone to set up their own rules and that's the beauty of Minecraft.

0,"This is just a guess, but your dogs might be safer if you narrow down the killing chamber to one block wide instead of three. That should make it harder for the skellies to get an angle on them, put other skellies in the way of their shot, and make sure the dogs can always reach their target."

1,"I love that you said you're gonna do smaller projects! My favorite episodes are the ones where you build some small and quirky gizmos like TNTree choppa, indie brewer, vending machine etc.

Also smaller projects mean less time spent making an episode, and more frequent uploads right?

Right??"
1,"I've been finding bundles very useful myself. In addition to a similar utility bundle I keep on me, it's made organizing my ender chest a lot easier. My redstone shulker box has several bundles of things I either don't use much but can help with troubleshooting or I won't ever need a full stack of for a project. Stuff like sherds and armor trims now have their own bundle rather than a dedicated shulker box. I've also been experimenting with packaging parts for redstone components like item filters, autocrafting, flying machine, etc. in bundles so I can figure out the components I need and grab the bundles for them. I wish they added a way to automatically fill bundles, though, to make things easier."

19,"I will say I think to a degree it is a game design flaw if people choose going AFK over actually playing the game. That means the fun of achieving it through game play is not fun enough to warrant the time spent. People would rather play as little of the boring parts as possible, in order to play as much of the fun parts as possible. And it may be possible to make those boring parts fun, but if that is difficult for players to do, then that too is a game design flaw. I think there should be fun and engaging alternatives to farming materials designed by the developers, rather than leaving it to the players to find out. For example, mob loot; Killing mobs out in the world will never give enough loot at a decent enough pace to not make the player get sick of it before they have enough for whatever they need it for. And as such, people turn to building mob farms. And while mob farms doesn't require you to go AFK, it isn't exactly fun standing at one either, so I think there should be a buff to looting, or dungeons should get a rework essentially function as a mob slaughter arena, where the player fights the mobs rather than watching them die in a trap. Let this be a fun alternative that yields a decent haul of mob loot.

I've actually built a mob arena myself in vanilla survival, using spawners. The main problem was there was no way to move the spawners, so I was lucky to find about 4 or 5 that were relatively close to each other. But even then, it was quite the lame arena. If it were possible to silk touch spawners, and maybe set the distance they turn on, then I would totally build a mob arena, and use that as my main way of getting mob loot. But I still think Mojang themselves should do this. And I suppose they did with the trial chambers, but those don't have nearly enough mob variety. I suppose they could do more trial chambers themed around different mobs. Like a nether one for blazes, wither skeletons, magma cubes, etc."
0,"Hey hey, how's it going good sir? 
With all the new changes and updates, is there anything from the Create mod you would like to be added to vanilla?
For example; immersive and cool  acutal working windmills, water wheels, mining drills etc.
In my opinion I don't think it would be a too far of a gap, it would incourage more interaction and get rid of some of the static and boring stuff that everyone has done a milion times.
Granted it would add to the inventory management issue, but they should also dedicate a future update with a inventory overhaul."
1,"hey etho I was wondering what some of your favorite TV shows are, what genres do you tend to lean to?

0,BioShock is a better theme for the trail chamber farm I think. It's a steampunk style game and it goes nice with the aesthetic of the trial chamber
1,"Night has been blessed, thank you etho missed ya ‚ù§"
0,Etho plays Minecraft months after being addicted to fishing...
0,"Honestly with the fog effect in the Pale Forests... I think a dark evil castle/ ""Mordor"" esk fortress would fit in so amazingly especially with your Amplified world. A big tall volcano with a dark evil looking castle that's kind of broken down and patched with wood (The Hobbit Goblin City inspired dilapidation). 
I have no clue what things of use could be built under/inside the above build idea... maybe some shifty floor flower farms for the Eye Blossoms. Maybe a Resin Farm, but that isn't Biome Specific like Flowers...
Idk, to me the pale forest esthetic really feels perfect for some dark LOTR Mordor esk builds. Like Decked Out 2s Castle, don't get me wrong it looks perfect just where it was built... but imagine that build but IN a Pale Forest with the fog effect and spooky silence with custom random audio like Jevin had in his base this season during Halloween. I know you stay pure vanilla but just imagine it all coming together to create a really dark, evil and super scary looking and feeling build/biome to explore and show off."

2,"I vote yes, honestly the idea of ""vaults/silos/bunkers"" being tied together via a rail line with each focusing on different things like your described sounds awesome! It sure would be a TON of work but in the end the would go a long way towards making the ""farm"" fit I. The world with some lore to back it up. Nothing is worse than amazing builds that look like crap and don't really ""fit"" in the world."

0,"I can't say that I agree about afk farms being like using creative mode.  If  I put in the work to build a contraption, move a bunch of sheep in, and then can get wool out of the chests, I still had to invest time into getting that one resource set up.  Just because I'm not walking in with shears and clipping every wool off a sheep doesn't mean it is anything like creative.  It just means that there is no longer a need to worry about that single resource while going and dealing with other stuff.
You don't seem to have any problem with trading for resources.  How is that any different?  If you buy a bunch of redstone dust, that's not really any different.  Stop using villagers and go mine your redstone!  There's just... There's no need to gatekeep what is acceptable gameplay or to naysay farms.  It isn't at all like creative mode to spend a few hours setting up a farm for a resource.  And, while you are right that a fully afk farm doesn't require efficiency, that's a good thing.  That means you can *decorate* without worrying about loss of efficiency.  Or change the shape to fit it in an unusual space.  Or just do it yourself without any help *because you can.*  You're arguing against that in favor of... what?  Following the most efficient farm tutorial on YT?  Because it sure sounds like that's what you just said.  That improving efficiency of farms is the only goal.
Well, guess what.  There are only a few people even *capable* of improving the efficiency of many of the farms out there, anymore.  They've been pushed to extremes, after this many years, and there aren't actually many people who can do *anything* to improve them.  But you know what I could do that ilmango can't?  Build it my way, in my world, where I want it, and screw efficiency."
1,"The bonemealing is actually something I really dislike about Minecraft game design. It gives you the green particles and happily consumes your item, even when it has no effect. Really poor choice with an RNG based mechanic like growing crops. Especially for players who just gather bones regularly and don't have crazy farms."

0,WOOOOOOO ETHO BACK
0,"Huh, not sure about Bats dropping echo shards, but I like your idea for skulk sensors. I mean, they could add another sensor (maybe something with ""echo"" in the name, crafted with an echo shard?) that does precisely that: it records a specific sound when powered from one side or with a specific powerlevel and outputs power on another side / pwerlevel when it hears that sound."
2,"I had not seen any of that new stuff, you are really the only MC guy I watch anymore and I don't really keep up with it."

The themes sound so cool, and it'd be interesting working with the odd shapes created from the trial chambers, the spawner portals, and how the minecart track weaves through it all! Just know that Notch will have developed, released, and moved on from a spiritual successor to Minecraft before you finish it."

1,"Yayy Etho! Happy you're having so much fun with fishing (me too, haha. Was gonna say on the cusp of Barren and it's taking forever but literally just leveled up with a garg legendary, woo!)---but I sure have missed your videos! (Too bad fishing wouldn't make very engaging content... unless... Fishing champ strats rundown maybe? Heh).

The trial chamber ... uh, conglomerate? is really cool, and the idea about telling a story with it is great, too. Would be another large project but something that would nicely split up into smaller parts for more digestible content. Also agree about the calibrated sensor, programming by the player would have been super cool... the book's a nice solution to having to keep the wiki handy, though.

Would love to see what you might come up with as far as using the Creaking in unconventional ways. Mumbo had an idea using it as a player detector awhile back which was pretty cool, and reminded me of that one you built so long ago I can't remember how it worked, haha."

I know putting the modpacks together is a lot of work, but there are a lot of great modpacks on CurseForge I'm sure you would love! (CrazyCraft and ATM9 To The Sky are my current favorites) Most of them also have great quest systems with really good in-game explanations and tutorials, so I think a multiplayer series maybe with Team Canada or the Hermits could also be really fun!
Just curious, because you seemed really excited about your latest modpack, which ended up breaking (i think).

1,Now this was a good surprise
0,3d map of portals sir.
0,"What drove you to create Minecraft videos in the first place, and what drove you to continue making them?"
0,Finally ! My etho senses have been tingling all week
0,The silo is such a good show!
0,I was making food while looking at YouTube and what's more perfect than Etho
1,Etho I‚Äôve watched every single one of your videos for the past 5 years.and I won‚Äôt lie I completely forgot you existed until this video popped up in my feed and I‚Äôve never been happier. It‚Äôs only been a month idk why I forgot.
0,Etho what‚Äôs ur opinion on the iskall situation
0,23:13 i do wish there was a  vibration signal for tools/equipment breaking for it to detect for like a auto clicker afk mining machine to dispense a new pick when the one you're using breaks.
0,the trial chamber route feels like watching that 3d pipe screensaver (in a positive sense)
3,This reminds me of all the old school roller coasters people used to make way back in the day but I think this tops just about all of them!
0,Yay etho!
0,"Silo is such a good show! I instantly wanted to build something like it in Minecraft, but the scale has to be big."
0,He's back! The decorating idea is pretty fun but having villagers with an ominous potion is probably not a good idea sadly :(
0,He's baaaaaaack
0,Damnit Etho I have to listen to big blue now
0,"I think you can put a slab under the piston on the farm and I believe the dogs should be able to see and kill the skeletons without being able to be targeted by the skeletons. I tried a farm with similar layout and it worked, granted it was a couple versions ago so may have changed ."
0,The fishing song is the best song. I've missed it so.
0,14:10 HORN!!!
0,"good one etho, i have played with portals in the past and making all of that work must have been quite the chore, apart from the linking issues, im sure that you had some of them, not because you dont know how to link but because it simply had to happen just by the volume of portals. i know you want the bones but honestly i dont know if i would bother with the wolves for that on the other hand, specially if you have to build several wolf chambers. if you could somehow funnel all the mobs into a central chamber like to pretend to do with brezzes... but there are simply too many of them to simply use minecarts for that i think.

apart from that, and since you are apparently the expert fisher of minecraft, in honor of the minecraft idea of the day segment, how would you make vanilla fishing interesting? any ideas you want to share?"
0,"Etho, you have spoken in the past about wanting a way for entities to interact with the world to make it feel alive. Does the armorstand plugin on hermitcraft satisfy that need? I've always wondered how Mojang could incorporate something like that while still feeling ""vanilla"""
0,"Hey Etho! I was wondering: saying as you've got one of longest single player series for minecraft (if not the longest), have you considered doing something like a ""throw back"" question at the end of your episode? One question could be from a book you've answered before, the other a new comment. I feel like it would give you a good reason to go back to the library and finish it, use it, etc. It would also give some new comers, as well as long time viewers, a chance to hear your thoughts on something that you might have answered years ago--so wouldnt necessarily pick again! (Especially if your answer has changed over time) thanks for all the hard work over the years"
1,"Ergo, have you ever played Satisfactory? I feel it is a game you would enjoy :)"
0,just recently i started binging this series again and now a new one thank you legend
0,"was waiting for a ""back to fishing"" at the end there"
0,It amuses me that the opening was probably the first time an Etho only watcher has been made aware of his fishing addiction.
0,"Hey Etho, could you potentially avoid Wolves dying to thorns by making an automatic wolf armour farm out of the new armadillo scute?"
1,Didn‚Äôt see you on the fishing world and was hoping that meant you were working on a video. Turns out I was right. Hope to see you fishing again soon. Now time to watch your LP.
2,Glad you covered some of the update. You are the only MC YouTuber I watch these days.

0,THANK YOU ETHO FOR THIS
0,Etho number 1!
0,you can set up a regen beacon for your dogs i think that affects them
0,"Wow‚Ä¶ I really wish the skull sensor works they way you described, I hate that all my horn activated redstone can also be activated by rockets and eating"
6,"was about to go to bed, but then you returned from the deep depths of mcci fishing, which is a much anticipated event that i had to witness in real time lol (congrats on the first place!). it's been great to get a video from you again! as always, they are a joy and a comfort. also, i really like the decorating idea you had for your trial chamber farm! seems like a massive project, but i think it would be a cool way of making this absolutely massive farm feel alive and fully intergraded into your world. could be a very cool thing to work on when you're in a building mood!"
0,Can you paste the Book here too please :)
0,Omgggggggggggg its time everybody!!!
1,I am blown away at how many farms you connected my goodness
0,"Wait Etho, have you watched severance?!"
0,"Hi Etho It‚Äôs been so fun to see you around on MCCI and to fish with you! Loved the episode as always, I watched it while fishing"
0,"Hey Etho have you ever checked out a game called ""Vintage Story?"" It remind me of terrafirmacraft and thought of your previous series which you have said that you enjoyed."
1,*Im Here*
1,Etho's Pavlov experimenting himself for trades lol
0,Etho episode on my birthday!!???
0,babe wakeup a new etho video dropped
0,The fallout shelter idea for the 12 trial chambers sounds so cool!
420,Hey Etho! I‚Äôm an MCCI fishing regular and I‚Äôve had such a blast watching you climb the ranks over the past few weeks. Thanks for all the laughs and helpful pointers you‚Äôve given us in chat. You‚Äôve been such a positive force in the community. Looking forward to getting cozy and watching this episode tonight! :)
0,"Hey Etho, thanks for the episode! I was wondering what the fishing clip at the start was about? Since I‚Äôve been watching this channel for 12 years, I‚Äôm kinda an adult with responsibilities now and don‚Äôt have much time in my hands lol.  I don‚Äôt watch any MC videos except yours. Would love to hear the context about what you‚Äôve been up to!"
0,"me and my friend check ur channel everyday in class to see if you've uploaded, and finally we've been fed!!!"
3,"i've seen you doing crazy things, but the amount of time these trial chambers tunnels is absolutely insane"
1,Is it only me or was one of the pauses between notes in the nighttime theme slightly off. One repeater tickf to long. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
0,"New ETHO!!!! Whoooohooo! Team Canada, baby!"
0,we are so back
0,"Minecraft idea, using cauldrons to brew before the brewing stand. Get a full cauldron and throw in redstone to start, then ingredient. This process would lower the water level by 2. You can‚Äôt add redstone again nor glowstone but you can throw in fermented spider eyes to reverse effects. You get one potion that‚Äôs base duration"
6,"Happy to have you back Etho!

That pale biome looks gigantic!! It's the largest one I've seen for sure...!"
0,Fallout?? Etho plays Fallout New Vegas when?
0,Honey! No time for going to the hoapital! New Etho just dropped
44,Love the idea of adding villagers and lore to the chambers! Adds in life and makes it more immersive!
1,"You're actually the only Minecraft channel I still watch, so all that new update stuff is completely new to me."
0,HELLO ETHO :D HOPE YOU HAD FUN FISHING
0,fish king is back
4,thats gotta be the most chaotic start to an episode I've ever seen
0,"You are just most wonderfully insane! Legend! Also I didn't know the AFK framerate thing! I noticed that, but did not know about the setting! Thanks!"
0,Gotta go get my snack!
0,yay etho‚Äôs backkkk
11,I love the f-zero music in the trading hall üòÑ
0,The let‚Äôs play lives!!
0,finally i can go get my snacks ive been starving
0,"the library reminds me of prospero's books (a ps1 game based on a movie version of the Shakespeare play ""The Tempest"")"
0,so you want to build the fallout vaults in your trial chambers.... alright...
0,Bisous
6,"I for one only watch Etho for my Minecraft content, so was unfamiliar with the newest content / snapshots. 

I would love to see more smaller projects in episodes, I love the larger projects, but they are very time consuming which I can imagine takes a lot of IRL time. Maybe a few smaller projects will allow for more videos (which I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind!)

Thank you as always for the video Etho!"
0,"I have nothing interesting to say. For the glory of the algorithm, I will post this anyway."
1,Snacks fetched and hot chocolate ready were in for a great treat chat!!
0,"yay, he is back"
0,"With his fishing leaderboard grind complete, I guess I'll have to get some snacks now."
0,Journey before destination? Is Etho a Stormlight Archives fan?!?!
2,"Oh man, you watch Silo too, Etho? It's so good! Have you seen Severance? Great second season right now!"
0,"That was one of the longest minecart rides I've ever seen. As for what they could add, Mojang should steal mod mass storage systems powered by redstone. Magic it up along the way."
4,"15:02 I think they changed the way looting works. You have to hit them with it, not just hold it. That also breaks it with the bow/ tnt :("
1,"Those common elusive gargs are calling xD Just kidding, great episode! I've missed the vids"
0,The absolute best thing to cheer me up is a brandnew Etho video!! <3
0,Fallout x Minecraft would be awesome !
7,A cool idea for that amplified pale garden is to make a small abandoned town. The factory would be the cause of it and on one of the hills could be the factory owner's mansion. You could plant creakings around the place to simulate the horrible effects it had on the citizens.
1,Congrats on first place in the fishing game c:
44,"ive been watching the lp chronologically and im still 50 eps away so i cant watch this yet but just know im glad ur back and proud of your fishing achievements

0,"Honestly so happy with this direction, I absolutely adore every cozy decoration, finishing-touches and polish episode so much!

49,Guys dad's back with the milk- I mean fish
1,Bro finally returned from bass pro
2,I know this is unrelated to the video but you really need to play Terraria when the new update comes out. I don't know if you played 1.4 but just didnt record it but 1.4.5 will be coming out some time in the next few months and it would be really awesome to see you and Zisteau get back on that

1,It‚Äôs been a blast watching you on that leaderboard this last month! You and Scar managed to reel me in to fishing and now I‚Äôm hooked üé£. So cool to see this whole trial chamber/nether set up ü§©.
0,"hey etho
been loving the videos for years now 

maybe you are interested in learning some movement tech

ever since you could swap armor by right clicking it i learned to switch my elytra mid flight to my chestplate that i always hold on my hotbar 

its a lot of fun 
you keep the momentum but stop flying

hope youll try it 
have a good rest of your day"
0,YAY EPISODE!!! congrats on #1 on the leaderboard etho!!!

0,id watch etho fish for hours think of the stories he'd have to tell
1,Every time there's a long gap between videos I'm afraid Etho just retired and told nobody
6,remember when a project was practically just turning on and off water flow from a certain chocolate colored mob farm. simpler times. oh how things have changed.
0,"Loving the let‚Äôs play videos lately so jam packed with all sorts of content
Just wondering have you ever considered playing vintage story? It‚Äôs very similar to terrafirmacraft."
1,And now I am hooked on fishing. Thank you Etho. :) I saw him people.
0,is there a reason why you dont build a TNT looting farm (and use wolves instead)?
1,"Silo is such a good show, etho check out severance and sunny"
5,"Oh wow, I came up with the exact same utility bundle but with two fewer items lol. Great addition to the game."
0,Is there another mob the skeletons will target that you can use to draw the skeleton's attention before they reach the dogs?
0,welcome back buddy!
0,ETHOOOOOOO
89,"using the Library to streamline your time on other playthrus is such a Genius Etho move, and just thematically makes the Library so much more interesting

it's also a very Bdubs method of ""maximizing your enjoyment in-game"" because sure you could do the same thing with notepad but that's boring!"
0,"What a wonderful birthday present lol, Etho has returned from beating Minecraft Fishing
Thanks for the upload Etho, looking forward to your future projects!"
0,We still haven‚Äôt forgotten about how you betrayed your good friend iskal

0,12 trial chambers/districts? Is this how Panem was created? It was Etho all along?
1,How would you feel if for ep 600 world tour you made a back up then got some friends onto a server version to show around?
0,That intro has been here for so long
2,"Hey Ergo! I was playing terraria recently and thought of your series you had with Zisteau. It had me thinking of two things, if the team canada series for starblight desert from your perspective would ever be uploaded, and if you would do another playthrough of Terraria or similar games again. I think you would enjoy playing games like factorio, oxygen not included, and satisfactory! Thank you for being my favourite youtuber for over 10 years!"
0,HE LIVES
0,Etho!! ‚ù§‚ù§
6,Etho having a book full of calibrated sculk sensor power levels is such an old head thing to do.
0,"That farm is a ""go get a cup of coffee"" kind of farm, my goodness.  Imagine what it would be like with the faster minecart speed!"
1322,"I know this isn't probably something you'd be up for but honestly a ""just chatting"" type of video where you just talk through stuff (commonly-asked questions, thoughts on future LP projects, Hermitcraft, general YouTube things) while zipping through the trial chambers would be, at least to me, so fun. Getting to hear your thought process in general is always something I personally enjoy, and the visuals of you on your lil roller coaster-esque ride through these chambers is so so relaxing~

Great to have you back Etho! Congratulations on absolutely killing it in MCCI Fishing! üé£"
0,The villager trader hall is so pretty
0,How many rails did you use for the 12 trial chambers ?
