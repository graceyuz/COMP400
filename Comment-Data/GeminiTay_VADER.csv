0,"A screening of the award-winning documentary State Organs, exposing the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience, was held at George Washington University on April 23, 2025. After the screening, a survivor of the CCP’s forced organ harvesting, Falun Gong practitioners who were tortured in labor camps, and medical representatives answered questions from the audience.



A screening of a documentary about the CCP’s forced organ harvesting was held at George Washington University on April 23, 2025.

Many people were shocked and angered by the Chinese regime’s crimes exposed in the documentary. They called on the international community to take action to stop the CCP’s 26-year-long genocidal persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.

It took seven years to produce the documentary. The film unveils one of the most evil crimes in modern times—the CCP’s forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. The film documents two families’ search for their missing loved ones and firsthand testimony from military doctors, prison guards, and families of victims of forced organ harvesting. The documentary provides an opportunity for those who were silenced to speak out.

After the screening, Falun Gong practitioner Cheng Peiming displayed the 35 cm (13.8 inches) scar on his body that was caused by having a part of his liver and lung removed while he was imprisoned by the CCP.

He said he is living evidence of the CCP’s forced organ harvesting. “I thank the US Government and Robert Destro, former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, for bringing me to America … I went through nine medical examinations and it was discovered that my liver as well as lung were partially removed without my consent.”

Since he publicly accused the CCP of this heinous crime, Mr. Cheng, who lives in New York State, has received many death threats, vandalism of his car, and his home was broken into. According to leaked documents, the CCP’s security department is planning to defame, bribe, and even kill Mr. Cheng.",-0.9958

1,"4:54 You should talk about the search engine DuckDuckGo.
10:42 You can call the goose from untitled goose game a duck. But you should start the conversation with something else because there’s a 10% chance that this session 3 people, you talked to, retell what you said to one of them and then the other two do the same and they notice a pattern of you saying the word „Duck“. Then they could learn of the secret society if they don’t know.
24:31 So no one knows there is a secret society because that’s a test you'd do in that kind of situation to see if they got the same text or if they got text.
25:52 Make a triangle hole. It’s a great shape.
26:53 Set it up with someone else who you end up betraying. Or you choose Scar and tell him to do a water bucket clutch and tell him that the whole thing was about the assignment of companies and they have to be secret and they know each other (like there’s chat messages and they slowly learn) and one of them is a casino and you make both parties wager some wealth and you tell Scar to do a water bucket clutch and you make him explain the rules so he gets connected to the blame. Or you tell him it’s just a fancy fakeout to redo the boogieman idea. Or you make the casino thing sound like a lie (with like one word stumble and then someone else takes over explaining the idea to him because Scar just makes up a facade where he seems way simpler and more gullible in this series. You tell him when you’re getting your first and last customer that you want to duel Scar yourself the next game. You could just make a falltrap next and surprise the customer and scar. Or whoever seems to have a big enough ego to water bucket clutch.
27:20 So you just make a few fall traps everywhere (like one Person does and the others do something else that’s more targeted).
27:51 You make them trigger it themselves.
29:18 Don’t eat playdough.
42:48 You only have to break one block.
44:44 You can now force Etho onto your team.
46:26 He should just say that he was in the nether gathering potion materials. But in a way he'd say it. (Because he wouldn’t know and would therefore think he should hide it but because. Actually he would know because of chat so he'd say he was gathering potion materials.
50:44 Should have said that he didn’t think about it.

or you know.. .something like that... 

was still really funny watching every one try to blame grien and you guys trying to find a way to say he wasnt in on it. 

also if there was stone blocks you could have dug a smaller tunnel the side direction with a ladder out and your tunnel to the base and just blocked over your exit with stone so it looked natural and they would fallow the side tunnel. could go back later to fill in more of it so no one could dig for it",0.6839

I also had the most success when strip mining a 3 block height at level 10 with pockets every 4 blocks until I found my first cluster of diamonds.

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS) and a quality engineer in the U.S., said that he had learned about the CCP’s live organ harvesting when he attended a meeting in Houston, where a Falun Gong practitioner talked about her experience of being forced to work for no pay and having her blood drawn in a forced labor camp.

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS)

After watching the film, he was both sad and angry. Mr. Stansell said, “It’s really hard to accept that there’s a country and a government behind this. We rely on the government to protect us and guard us, but a government is doing this. It’s really heartbreaking, frustrating, infuriating, and sad.

“Those who stick to their beliefs deserve our admiration. They endure all kinds of torture and do not abandon their beliefs. This really makes many of us ashamed.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club from Kansas, U.S., finished watching the movie in tears. “This is so heartbreaking. I can’t bear it,” she said. “This is so shocking, it’s hard to believe this is true, it’s hard to believe this kind of thing can happen in the world.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club

Rolf Thingvold, a Rotarian and senior sales executive at a large Norwegian software company, said “State Organs” was a very moving and powerful story and that the organizers had done a great job. He also understood that “the filmmakers took a big risk.”

0,"I don't think they'll see this but I think. A cool Base idea could be if they're going to like do the lighthouse with each material if section being like a new block from each update. And since two of their original builds were trees they can like add two trees on either side of the lighthouse that like wind up the sides of the lighthouse and they can be made of all the new added woods so it starts out with oak and then you change it to the next newest tree so on and so forth until you reach the leaves and they can just be like a bunch of different kinds of leaves.😊 I think like it would give the lighthouse like an old factor to it which might lean into like a villain hideout place or a 'Villy' hideout

I paused right after False asked Gem if she had a tag, and my first reaction was people shouldn't be able to just generically call out that someone might be trying to tag. They should see the tag or outright accuse, so Gem could have said no, left, then False sees it in editing and is tagged. But I guess if False sees Gem way in the background in game then asks if it's for tagging then it does count as a False thwarting a Gem in tag.

Gem, it's been such a joy following your videos these last 5 years. They provide a peaceful break from normal life, and it's so cool watching you unleash your art & creativity.

1,"In relation to mystery city at 6:20 , I immediately thought it was familiar as being Melbourne, because there are lots of colourful skyscrapers there (even famous green ones) and there always seems to be cranes around. I was wondering if anyone also might think it’s Melbourne or if someone recognises or knows it to be somewhere else. I’m curious…

Update: The sign is a Ukrainian pedestrian crossing sign, I can’t find what city in Ukraine it is though. I was very wrong thinking it was Melbourne…

Update 2: Looking at Ukraine skylines, my best guess is Kyiv, the capital city, as I found photos with a similar looking building as the picture Gem used, even with a crane near it.",0.204

Also Gem: build brutalist architecture that would be totally unthinkable in the middle ages.

Gem ... horizontal stone structures are really difficult to build. In the medieval times, humans mostly still built nothing but arches, walls, pillars and domes out of stone. For stone pillars you kind of need tensioned steel reinforced concrete. And that's not even period appropriate for brutalism.

Any scientist moving in would have to work with the preexisting layout to some extent. You can even have it where walls have been changed or added. With just the feast hall done, it doesn't have that reclaimed vibe yet. Hopefully when it gets closer to done, the narrative will be a bit clearer.
BDub's base from last season was like this too. It might be good to look back and take notes if you're having a hard time here.

 noticed when you were adding to the lab room like stone which was suppressed to be like wiring and you left an opening. You should put red dust in there and every few blocks put a redstone lamp. every so often put a cooper grates instead of stone so the redstone could be seen 

Going with the Frankenstein's monster theme from earlier, maybe put a table with an armor stand laying down. for the head put the head of a warden and for the body just plain brown leather.

You should also make shelves with heads in jars on one of the walls. Maybe one for each hermit, maybe Steve and some of the mobs too to add to the old creepy lab. You can put some pale hanging vines to like like dust on the jar (and maybe the tubes with Jimmy and Martin).

1,"Something I never got is spoilers for streams and others showing parts of others' builds when they might not have shown them in their video.  If anything, it makes me want to watch the next video of that hermits collection to see the process of them building it.  Like this room, I have seen this completed lab in both grians and glin gems own live stream, and I'm still watching this video.

Like I understand wanting to see it in all its glory in the video, it was made in,  but seeing it in another's video at a glimpse or even in full isn't the full picture. Watching the process and their thoughts as they build it is just as much fun to watch

I guess what I'm saying is I feel the spoiler culture for hermit is a little too much. I feel it does great to advertise other  hermit videos.

0,"For the tubes and what Grian was suggesting you could have a book somewhere describing the experiments, or signs with numbers measuring something, or how long they've been in the tubes. Maybe they're researching what is in the water, and how that might form these monsters that we only see in these waters. If so, one tube could be a person submerged in the water, and the other the same, but with a catalyst or something they have found in the water (fx near/ on/ or after an encounter with the kraken). The result would be that just the water has no special effect, but combined with the catalyst the person exposed grows mutated fish like features. Maybe the reason why the kraken is so big is because it's been exposed to this catalyst it's whole life. And if humans react by mutating into fish like creatures maybe the fish monsters in the water are, at least partly, fishermen and seafarers who vanished. OR something completely different :)",0.7981

I remember Owen and/or Pearl doing screenshot selfies, so if you DO turn Jimmy and Martyn into sea monsters, you could screenshot the before pictures of them in the tubes to have in an office or something with lore books about the process that they underwent. THEN for the sea monsters themselves you could make skins for that to get the heads... Which wouldn't have to be Jimmy and Martyn themselves, but I think it'd be fun if it was. 😂",0.8782

0,"Hi Gem, thanks for the cool build!

Regarding the Kraken, I have been thinking it has been lacking something for a while now.

The monster is meant to evoke a sense of inescapable dread.
Sailors are supposed to fear the shear size of even a single tentacle they cannot see the source of. Not even when under the water.
The must understand they witness but a fraction of a being that is more natural calamity than a living thing while in paralysing fear of what they know they cannot see but imagination and adrenaline fills in anyway.

That sense of scale and inescapable horror is best captured by the Kraken not actually bludgeoning or attacking to cause real damage.
It is the fact it is grabbing people and PULLING them to it. Like a snack. An inconsequential morsel of food to be picked at like a bag of peanuts.

And when finally witnessing the Kraken the moment before certain death they should bear witness to an overwhelmingly fathomless maw of unending hunger. Like an endless cavern of teeth and flesh that will instantly rip you into ribbons of viscera.


Now you have modelled your Kraken maw after the Minecraft glow squid beak. And while it is a good for what it is, it doesn't capture the depth that a kraken should have. Nor does it really evoke any sense of 'the beast hungers'. It is designed to transpose a 3d squid beak onto a 2d face.

Whereas you are not limited by hitboxes like the devs are. You can make it so your Kraken is integrated into the walls it's so big. That it's body is so immensely massive that is literally the terrain. 

It's gullet should be a bottomless abyss of just rows and rows of teeth.
An uncountable amount of sharp teeth that would rip apart monsters of FAR greater size than a mere human. This would truly capture the essence of insignificance and existential horror that anyone pulled into the depths of the abyss should feel.",0.6788

However, you'd hafta figure out where to put your farms thats out of the way, especially since they're all clustered around the fortress.
BUT!! maybe the lore could be that it somehow escaped the aquarium (if you make jimmy and martyn turn into monsters, they could destroy the test tubes along with the aquarium) it could escape to the monster in the water, and maybe it eats the elder guardian and steals its 'power' making the area around the monster have mining fatigue. which would just be deeper in the water, as the AOE is kinda small-----> this could also potentially ONLY affect skizz as its closer to his base, at least partially, if you do want to mess with him.

1,"This actually wasn't my expected take on the prompt but it was really clever and tricky ❤ As a former Floridian, it was fun to watch people building flamingoes and manatees 😂❤ (I also like that flamingoes ended up in here given that Pink Flamingoes is a popular cult classic that fits very well into this month (definitely NSFW though, from what I've heard and the clips I've seen).

I love that the Skizz flamingo ended up in the Hall because it's adorable, and I honestly think there have been much more confusing Skizz builds than that one...such as the orange Ariel, or the one where someone was hiding from the police and they were blue thumb people or something 😂❤ Tbf though, I also gotta say that IRL ""red"" hair is not (unless dyed) like, bright apple red, it's usually more of an orange color and we just call it red. So I think if the bikini and tail were the right colors, people still would have guessed Ariel. It's just that Disney used very bold red with their cartoon magic, I think she also had sisters with bright blue hair or something which is not IRL natural either. (Actually it's additionally cool that the Little Mermaid ended up in a video for this month if you know anything about the inspiration behind one of the greatest Disney villains ever imo, Ursula ❤)

For Joel's, I could see the owl, because he definitely made the face round. But at least it remained a white bird at the end 😂❤ As for his whale, though...I'm honestly not sure what happened there 😅 but I loved the resulting guess and build.

Scar reached out to Impulse and Tango to get either one of their help to get a redstone mechanism to open bubble columns every once in a while to keep them alive, but i dunno if they managed to do it yet and i dont know if you can get the required redstone stuff. Grian and i think etho as well, stuffed them in one by one bubble column pods to build the speed boost things.

I started playing this after the last episode and my squids and dolphins also didn't want to live. I also played the previous version of this datapack, so I definitely tried to plan ahead.

1,"ᰔ 🐐ABOUT GOATS: 🐐ᰔ

FOOD: Wheat

SPECIAL ABILITY: VERY HIGH jumping (can jump over fences and high walls) 

PERSONALITY: Naughty 

COOL FACT: In Minecraft, goats typically spawn with two horns, but they can lose one or both horns by ramming into specific solid blocks (such as stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, logs, or packed ice), which causes them to drop a goat horn. A goat with only one horn is therefore one that has already rammed a block and dropped one of its two horns but still retains the other. Below, I address the probability and mechanics of encountering a one-horned goat in the game, based on available information.",-0.7392

Then you place a block adjacent to the hole but one up right above the middle block or what would be the down arrow key.

If one of those is a slab or other ""partial"" block the golem will place snow layers on the other three. If you position yourself correctly, you can mine all three at the same time. I'm not exactly sure what blocks all work for this, I'm using an enchanter as a nearly indestructible block I can't break while using the farm. My settup uses a pair of hopper minecarts on a circular track underneath to collect and distribute the snowballs across 8 hoppers feeding into a pair of auto crafters. It can fill a double chest of snow blocks in a couple minutes. Perfect for large construction projects or as an fast-breaking temporary block when building.

You want all your animals at least 20 blocks away from whatever arena/containment cell you build around the OneBlock. One of the phases spawned me a Warden and I lost all my turtles to it's sonic attacks before I could kill it. By the time the Block randomly generated me more, it had already spawned the End Portal and this did something to mess up their breeding... even when I put sand at/around the OneBlock they wouldn't lay eggs anymore. It was as if their ""home beach"" coordinate was corrupted by the Portal just below. I eventually had to use commands to fix the issue and ""replace"" the bugged turtles with ones that could actually lay eggs.

A similar issue: any villagers spawned by the OneBlock will function like normal villagers for trade, but cannot have children... So you *have* to use cured villagers or villagers from the *very rare* spawn eggs found in chests. Once you have those, you can make a standard breeder and have infinite villagers.",-0.7003

You just have to wait for night to fall to plant your mushrooms on a block other than podzol or mycelium. Alternatively, you can buy podzol from wandering traders to start farming them.",-0.8126

2,"Woohoo! 🎉 We're back on one block! This is one of my favorite series that you do. I mean, I love everything! But this one has a special blend of coziness, risk, and satisfaction 🙂

I do the coliseum thing as well. However, I like to build a 5x5 pit around the one block, so all the mobs drop down two or three blocks. I can stand on the edge to mine it and occasionally hop across to collect things, but creepers and such don't just walk into my good areas. In the past I've tried stone walls and stuff. Anything that is placed in a two block radius around the one block will get deleted, I believe. Or at least it used to. I'm glad this series is not hardcore so that regardless of how aggressive the mobs get against you or your builds we'll still have a full series out of this one 😅",0.9561

One note with that Mushroom. You do not need to wait for podzil to farm it. I have a 'mushroom farm' in my storage/brewing/enchanting/lava farm/ dripstone farm/portal/mine entrance/wolf den/axolotol pool basement room. It's crazy. I started on just dirt, but they also grow on stone, and both types of nylium as well as they do on podzil.
