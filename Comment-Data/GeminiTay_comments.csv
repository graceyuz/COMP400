4,"You know Gem, you say you didn't do much, but really, each member of the Secret Society contributed an important element to the trap.

Etho was set up. Grian was execution. You were cover story. You're much more definitive non-involvement when you backed up that neither of the others were responsible is exactly what allowed Etho and Grian to better pass as conceivably innocent in the eyes of the server.

While it's true that many weren't convinced, you played an integral role in establishing plausible deniability."

0,"A screening of the award-winning documentary State Organs, exposing the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience, was held at George Washington University on April 23, 2025. After the screening, a survivor of the CCP’s forced organ harvesting, Falun Gong practitioners who were tortured in labor camps, and medical representatives answered questions from the audience.



A screening of a documentary about the CCP’s forced organ harvesting was held at George Washington University on April 23, 2025.

Many people were shocked and angered by the Chinese regime’s crimes exposed in the documentary. They called on the international community to take action to stop the CCP’s 26-year-long genocidal persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.

It took seven years to produce the documentary. The film unveils one of the most evil crimes in modern times—the CCP’s forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. The film documents two families’ search for their missing loved ones and firsthand testimony from military doctors, prison guards, and families of victims of forced organ harvesting. The documentary provides an opportunity for those who were silenced to speak out.

After the screening, Falun Gong practitioner Cheng Peiming displayed the 35 cm (13.8 inches) scar on his body that was caused by having a part of his liver and lung removed while he was imprisoned by the CCP.

He said he is living evidence of the CCP’s forced organ harvesting. “I thank the US Government and Robert Destro, former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, for bringing me to America … I went through nine medical examinations and it was discovered that my liver as well as lung were partially removed without my consent.”

Since he publicly accused the CCP of this heinous crime, Mr. Cheng, who lives in New York State, has received many death threats, vandalism of his car, and his home was broken into. According to leaked documents, the CCP’s security department is planning to defame, bribe, and even kill Mr. Cheng."

Gem, you did A LOT. You basically found Etho, you stole the diamonds for game prize (didn't die and patiently waited for the opportunity like a true villy), and you did a lot of efficient social work during the debates! Among us best player showcase! You were really persuasive there, especially about Scar and ""we are easy to frame here, but it wasn't us"". When I watched Martyn's perspective, I really belived you. 

Yes, you three ended this session being the suspects, but overall confusion definitely counts. 

Love the series so much! Great work, villies 🥰"

124,"Honestly when Grian said that if Gem did the octo kill she'd be pressed less, he was kind of right. Gem doesn't do traps, her being away, like pearl, wouldn't be odd, and if she said she was building at the base, like the cottage core queen she is, they'd believe her.

But also I don't see a way this octo kill couldn't have been Grian, it's so him coded. And now he has a target on his back lol."

0,I knew gems POV was gonna be the one to watch
0,This was such a fun episode :)
0,"Seeing the Square Hole be replaced with dirt in this version feels bad, my heart goes out to all the digging Gem did in the previous session.  Truly a service to the entire server."

1,"This is like House of Dragons when they replace characters suddenly between episodes. And of course deceptions, plotting, intrigue and murders. 😂"
0,DUCK LIFE CONFIRMED
0,"Y'all seem to be missing a golden opportunity with Etho's plan. Sure someone probably would have to play to lure them into the game but if neither u or Etho die this episode, then y'all will have to pvp anyway, so y not rock paper scissors it to decide who is the bait for this trap"

1,"I saw this first from BDubs POV and I legitimately gasped, it was just incredible and I had no idea who was behind it 😂"
0,Seems like whatever gem had was passed on to grian lmao
1,57:38 Grian called Gem evil for planting it because people don’t put netherwart in their “lovely Enlglish gardens”
0,An hour of Gem ! We have been blessed again

0,if I had a nickel  for every time gem killed a significant part of the server as a green I'd have 2 nickels which isn't alot but its weird it happened twice
0,Stop this episode was genuinely peak😭
0,"i think that octokill is the craziest kill of the whole series! people weren’t sure who to blame so grian, gem, and etho got away with it thanks to martyn and scar being suspicious. also, hello? 8 PEOPLE? is that the biggest kill in the whole series?"
1,What happened to your voice
0,"if the villians are team rocket and Etho is always plotting with them, maybe he's Giovani. I mean he did (successfully) plan an 8 person murder with them."
0,Oh you guys with the ducks again. The society thing is insane. Probably some lore stuff(not really a lore fan person) those kills were insane Gem.
0,"I cant believe the most effective trap of the while Life series is basically just a button that says ""do not press"" that triggers a pitfall"
0,The way all three of the members I watch got into the secret society.
2,"Im only 18 minutes in when i say this but..
Watching Joels video first then coming here right after is SO FUNNY. Like Joel had no idea that those three were a secret society. And etho grian and gem tryna have a secret conversation with him around is hilarious."
0,Joel was in so much danger in the nether!!!!
0,Its Grian catching the cold for me
0,"The ""greater good"" two lives instead of six argument really did not pan out, did it."
0,The greater good
0,"What's crazy is nobody would ever suspect Grian, Etho, and Gem being in a secret group.  Gem and Grian are part of Team Rocket and Gem and Etho are always hanging out together.  Not unheard of that any of them would want to tag along with the other two."
0,Ehck the lava
0,This episode pretty much cements in my Clockers Extended lore that Etho is secretly Gem's father (Etho knows but Gem doesn't).
0,"I did not expect The Square Hole (TM) to claim as many kills as it did, with the conspicuous grass."

0,"I rewatched the sand falling like 4 times, it was so satisfying haha"
0,Etho how could you😂
0,I watched Skizz pov first and I wasnt even suspicious of the game. Etho sold it well and everyone's hype and the confusion of who will go climb first just made everybody not bother to think that it's a death trap 😂
0,OMG that was epic! My heart was racing...GG
0,Yay I'm glad your feeling better and I love your videos and I just got the new minecraft update and your right to be excited everything is so cute and I love it. 4:04 what is going one

2,"That octakill is legendary! I love this little twist, the result is one of the best multi-kills in all of the life series. I'm glad you were a member of the secret society, it was very fun to see you plot with Grian and Etho. Glad your voice is back too, that must feel a lot better. Amazing video Gem, your pov is always my favorite!"
0,scar was third (4th i guess) impostor with the way he was basically framing himself. he didn’t even react in chat when it happened 😂
0,"It was literal chaos with the existence of secret society
Gem was really clever with her words and actions, going back and forth between the teams and stepping up the moment Grian got accused.. I could never 😅😅
Gem: ""Well I literally didn't do very much""
Me: No! you defended your partners in crime like a pro 😎"

0,Naur they recast Gem again
0,All hail the hole
0,"That was incredible, I even stopped breathing"
0,"This was a team up I have been waiting for, for so long. 3 of the most clever people on this SMP."
0,"The fact that the secret society instructions were in the chat *and* in the subtitles is quite bad for accessibility, because they overlap! Normally, the chat is entirely unimportant, but i think this marks the first time in the Life Series that there is critical information in the chat. I'm not sure what's the best solution here, but could you perhaps tell the subtitle editors to move the subtitles to a different location when this happens, or move your chat up somehow?"
0,"the SCREAM that i SCRUMPT after EIGHT PEOPLE DIED OH MY GOSH- 
i think my neighbors are a little concerned 
the duck egg off-brand villies of the secret society are incredible....."
1,"Gem & Etho need their own evo world just for PVP. No more missed versions! 
I’d watch any iteration of that. A stream, a series, just them or a full  bracket of friends with different divisions, Gem and Etho’s Canadian PVP school, anything."
0,"Putting everything else aside, I don’t think lighthouses usually have spirals I think this is more of a barbershop pole"
0,I love the longer episodes. Much Love!!!
0,Maybe place water at the bottom of the Hole when you are resting it? Not sure if water breaks the fall in these versions yet
0,You should put water at the bottom while building the hole
1,why is the square hole so lethal!! its so pathetic of a trap it integer underflows into being genius!
0,Gem could u pick out a pokemon from sword and shield and name it i will find it and capture it
0,"Gem, this has been an amazing episode, and so much fun! ❤ And I certainly don't mind the length, it leaves a lot of room for storytelling, especially since the secret society has been established now. 🤫 Can't wait to see what shenanigans you, Grian and Ethos come up with in the future!
Also big fan of the square hole, and found myself chanting ""another one!"" ⬛️☠️"
0,Are we just not going to talk about how in the cc’s it says everyone presses x to doubt? That was the funniest part of this episode 😂
0,50:46 THE SUBTITLE 'everyone presses X to doubt' 😆

0,"As of 1.3.1, arrows can activate wooden pressure plates."
0,Frankly I dunno what y'all think scar is gonna light on fire lol the base is made outta nom burnable materials
10,"Seeing the physics creeping up that tower and just dropping players as it went, that was possibly the most spectacular thing I've seen on this platform. Just stunning. Absolutely gorgeous. And then the chat logs stacking up. The people just left standing confounded at the bottom. The plan was bold, and it was beautiful. 

And of course, the square hole has never failed to disappoint. Still leaving its mark in the chat logs."
0,so do the members of the secret society change or is this a thing that goes cross session
0,"Damn, this might be the episode with the most deaths in all the life series."

1,11:05 the straightforwardness of Etho I love it much xD
1,Watching Pearl's perspective first and then seeing this is crazy because I had NO IDEA any of the secret stuff was happening
2,"Gem still thing you should farm chickens for eggs then replace people diamonds with the eggs you can have so many diamonds I said it last episode but I did it to my sister so it kinda worked because it has the same shape plssss do it

2,"You know what would've gotten the sus off of Grian (if yall had thought of this beforehand). He does trigger, but then jumps into a pool of lava or something, but like, as soon as he triggered, so he can be like: Dangit, I died in the Nether"
0,The square hole is the real villian
1,have episode 3s become infamous for the amount of deaths and chaos?
0,DUCK LIFE?!?!
11,15:28 does bdubs have eyes on the bottom of his legs?
32,"I thought that this season might be a little longer than past ones since everyone started with six lives. I guessed it was so they could go through more versions of Minecraft. But between the boogeymen, the square hole, and the king of the ladder kill I don't know if that's going to be the case. I haven't seen this much death since Limited Life. Ha ha. XD

This was such a fun episode! Probably one of my favorite ones ever. Grian really did cook with the secret society idea and the three of you were a great team up for it."
0,Surprised how long it took people to question the sand tower.
0,11:07 smooth etho
0,It would be really cool if in a later episode a different lifer was an impostor member of the society and had to stop the other members

1,The secret society idea is so good and i hope it comes back

3,Gem gave Grian her sick voice lmao it just took till the end of the session to transfer
374,Having watched Joels POV first and not knowing what's going on. There is something so funny to me about Joel accidentally stumbling into the secret society meeting. And the way while he's just casually gathering neither bricks they are plotting his murder.
1,square hole my beloved

39,"Part of the collaborate kill is the cover up and y'all participated IMO. Grian gets targeted, gem jumps to defend, etho gets questioned by the block choice, grian changes the subject and y'all planned together. There was chances for them to see all of you together and no one mentioned it. Clean."

2,"26:48 a few years ago, some content creators I watched were part of a purge server and someone did this, or at least a version of it. Because it wasn't during purge time, there had to be a trial."

0,These fanfics are going to be gorgeous 😢
0,The society is pleased!
7,"Thinking about the mind games of grian saying duck at that point is crazy (this is the first perspective I'm watching) this is some serious prisoners dilemma type thing lmao. If he's in the society of course he knows and would say the word. If he's not in the society but he knows the word anyway he gets a really good chance to uncover the society, maybe the best one on the server. If he's not in the society but he can guess at the word that's a little lower of a chance. If he's not in the society but doesn't know the word then he's just as clueless as the server"
1,"If anyones seen it, this gives such traitors x secret life vibes and I love it!"
0,The whole time I was watching this i was thinking about how sick the animatics are going to be
2,I am so glad it was the first perspective I've watched but at the same time I think it would be so fun to be confused the whole episode about wispers!

618,"Gotta give Etho props for that plan, he sold it to the rest of the server perfectly!

1,The fact that the secret society’s initials spell out EGG and they’re secret word was duck is funny
0,0:36 glad you’re feeling better! Make sure you don’t strain yourself too much though
2,After the trap you guys should have accused Etho. No one would have suspected you guys working together if you were pushing on each other.
1,This turned into among us lol
0,44:30 LOL I can't believe you guys pulled it off and got away with it!

0,OMG THIS MIGHT BE THE GREATEST KILL IN THE LIFE SERIES MY HEART IS BEATING SO FAST
1,I guess Tara Reid isn't filling in for Gem's voiceover any more.

0,44:16 BEST MULTI KILL EVERR
0,I just know there is going to be so many animatics about the octo kill!
1,"I’m starting to see what is going on here, Is anyone else catching on to how every session represents one of the life series like so far 1st session was normal 3rd life, 2nd session was boogeyman from Last Life, & This Session represents Secret life with the task"
0,Lots of geese lots of ducks 🤣
0,"Grian and Gem totally could just manipulate Pearl into initiating King of the Ladder, claiming that they have a villainous plan. Secret society is not implicated because it's just the villainous thing to do."
0,"wow. an 8 multikill! that’s incredible!! and i love the lighting you added. also don’t worry about the episode length, the long episodes are awesome!"
9,Love that Pearl actually caught grians name tag on video as she walked towards the game but didn't see it in game... That was an epic multi kill!
1,So Grian was expecting Gem and Etho HAHAHAHA 17:40
0,I could feel the disappointment when nobody repeated Grian saying “the greater good”
0,Im glad i watch gems pov it was glorious.
0,THE SQUARE HOLE CLAIMS AGAIN
0,square hole \o/
0,"Spoiler 








They were required to take 2 lifes to keep from losing 6.

0,IT WAS GEM THE WHOLE TIME OMG😭
1,Etho is the mvp this season. He knows everything
1,OCTOKILL
0,"2 lives is better than the 6 lives lost next session, he said"
0,she’s on trending!!
0,"Im still up for a motto everytime they enter a conversation. Y'know annoy everyone to death.
Grian: Aha! Run away you see our traps rule! 
Gem: y'know we're super scary and honestly just so cool.
Pearl: My existence is pain, and our base is a crime. :'(
Together: Team villi is great. Now on through time!"
1,The secret society worked so good together! Etho had the ideas and was the host. Grian hid while activating the kill. And Gem was the master manipulator so nobody could arouse suspicion of Grian 😂😆
0,"We finally got the ""Duck"""
0,"44:30 They got 8 people. That was the funniest thing to watch 😂

46:50 it all sounds like a meeting on Among Us 😂"
1,"Showing up after everyone else does all the work and stealing 25% of the prize is truly villainous, well done, Gem"
0,24:35 wow the fire is so smooth in that version wth???
0,Grian has 64 kills; literally a stack of kills.
0,50:47 w subtitles 😂
1,I've gotten so used to Gem's sickly voice it genuinely feels weird to hear her normal voice
2,44:32 is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen.
0,I'm wondering since it said that the secret society had to still keep it a secret do they still have to keep it a secret next episode and will they still be in the secret society next episode?
1,"4:54 You should talk about the search engine DuckDuckGo.
10:42 You can call the goose from untitled goose game a duck. But you should start the conversation with something else because there’s a 10% chance that this session 3 people, you talked to, retell what you said to one of them and then the other two do the same and they notice a pattern of you saying the word „Duck“. Then they could learn of the secret society if they don’t know.
24:31 So no one knows there is a secret society because that’s a test you'd do in that kind of situation to see if they got the same text or if they got text.
25:52 Make a triangle hole. It’s a great shape.
26:53 Set it up with someone else who you end up betraying. Or you choose Scar and tell him to do a water bucket clutch and tell him that the whole thing was about the assignment of companies and they have to be secret and they know each other (like there’s chat messages and they slowly learn) and one of them is a casino and you make both parties wager some wealth and you tell Scar to do a water bucket clutch and you make him explain the rules so he gets connected to the blame. Or you tell him it’s just a fancy fakeout to redo the boogieman idea. Or you make the casino thing sound like a lie (with like one word stumble and then someone else takes over explaining the idea to him because Scar just makes up a facade where he seems way simpler and more gullible in this series. You tell him when you’re getting your first and last customer that you want to duel Scar yourself the next game. You could just make a falltrap next and surprise the customer and scar. Or whoever seems to have a big enough ego to water bucket clutch.
27:20 So you just make a few fall traps everywhere (like one Person does and the others do something else that’s more targeted).
27:51 You make them trigger it themselves.
29:18 Don’t eat playdough.
42:48 You only have to break one block.
44:44 You can now force Etho onto your team.
46:26 He should just say that he was in the nether gathering potion materials. But in a way he'd say it. (Because he wouldn’t know and would therefore think he should hide it but because. Actually he would know because of chat so he'd say he was gathering potion materials.
50:44 Should have said that he didn’t think about it.
52:57 It’s like a dimensional tear. (Due to space time space tears include time tears).
53:15 I know someone who used to build with quartz ore."

0,GUYSS I’m sick so I couldn’t watch it when it came out
1,I love the fact that they are incorporating stufffrom each of the past series in this! We got the secret life today and the boogey from other series and the 6 lives from last life I think
1,"This session was simply Absolute Cinema, history has been made"
0,i genuinly think thsi is the bEST series yet. and that is PURELY because of the square whole and the kings ladder game.

2,"for those who say Gem did nothing, she gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss"
0,"i mean.. the fact no one can know about the secret society .. makes me think the villans are the PERFECT scape goat... you should have told pearl about it under the guise that your trying to prove to the server your really villains. at that pint who cares if they know grian did it.. cuz they wont know the SOCIETY did it.... and all etho has to do was be the one to invite them to a game pearl recommended... him being cleared of suspicion means they wouldnt have a reson to think the 3 of you are in on it.  omg the perfect set up was right there.

or you know.. .something like that... 

was still really funny watching every one try to blame grien and you guys trying to find a way to say he wasnt in on it. 

also if there was stone blocks you could have dug a smaller tunnel the side direction with a ladder out and your tunnel to the base and just blocked over your exit with stone so it looked natural and they would fallow the side tunnel. could go back later to fill in more of it so no one could dig for it"

The 2 remaining dirt blocks hide evidence of redstone being used and the tunnel leads on a goose chase. Anyways had that thought and typed it#"

I feel like that just fits gem!"
0,"My guess for the past life winner is Etho. Not because of his early-mc skills, but the fact that every life series winner so far has won along side their double life partner. Grian and scar, third and secret. Scott and Pearl, last(simple) and double. Martyn and Cleo,  limited and real. Joel is th only who isn't paired and since he was in double life, Etho. This was my prediction before the concept of lastlife was released, and is still my prediction."
0,Gems new voice is taking on a whole new persona of its own haha
0,That must be a very old video! Old version of Minecraft and Gem's voice still sounds like she is in puberty.

0,"I love how non-villainous your team is/how incompetent you are as villains. 😂 Love you guys, I am rooting for a GeminiTay win!  

Also, just a thought, your base would look really evil if you added some blocks of coal in place of some of the sandstone because black and red naturally has a slightly evil undertone."
0,i’ve seen the bdubs “cheese” part from every perspective and it still cracks me up every time

0,"For diamonds, I had found these versions follow ""real world"" logic, where diamonds are often found close to sources of heat(lava pools) and around the coal that is in diamond level. AKA, if you see coal lower than Y18, mine around it and you'll probably find some diamonds.

I also had the most success when strip mining a 3 block height at level 10 with pockets every 4 blocks until I found my first cluster of diamonds. From that cluster, straight mine from its center to around 2-3 chunks further, do side pockets until you find the next cluster and repeat. With this strategy, I gathered about a stack of diamonds every 20min before the Caves and Cliffs update."

12,"12:08 ""Gem, you sound like Mumbo.""
Well Skizz, if you think SHE sounds like Mumbo, just wait til you hear your buddy Tanog this week..."
5,"31:09 So because I was curious about the explosions going on, I had a looksie over at Grian's POV of this session. Another trap gets sprung between cuts after Grian asks why nobody just walks across the pressure plates, then he resets one for ""Tango"" to try. The explosion from this one is what makes Gem look back and—JUST BARELY IN THE BACKGROUND—you *can see her look* in Grian's POV. Absolutely hilarious."

1,"GEM, I had the exact same cold you have, I promise your voice will get better. I was sick for 3 days at the end of the third day I was like ""yay I'm feeling better"" but then a few hours later the horse voice started, no pain just a voice I couldn't recognize. it took 2 weeks to get rid of that voice and every time I try to speak I startled myself😂. Basically it's a lot of snot stuck on the vocal cords, I found that tea does not help ( if it does I wasn't patient enough to find out) it should go away on its own. if you want to try to speed up the process, keep up on nose spray and vitamins specifically: vitamin C, D3, and zinc."

I think that what this will do is trick the villies into believing some of those plates are SAFE while others will exploit it and trap the villys base, basically double tricking them into dying </3 bad idea"

0,Gem is literally Jinx this season I suppose
0,29:20 why do I here mumbo
2,"This episode was great! Loving the shenanigans with the square hole, it might be one of the most successful life series traps funnily enough. Simple traps do seem to be more effective in this series. Skizz looking at the pressure plate, then deliberately stepping on it and falling was pure cinema, I was laughing so hard! I'm loving the Villies, definitely my favorite team so far!"
1,"Voice still damaged, huh? Oh well, as long as it doesn't hinder your gameplays. 🙂

2:29 Siblings vibe returns."
1,These guys aren't beating the Team Rocket allegations

0,So fun fact as someone who knows WAY too much about the pokemon world: Team Rocket is just straight up the pokemon mafia (hence why jesse james and meowth have such elaborate shenannigans infinite money glitch) so the villies dont technically need a hot air balloon to be team rocket

0,"Meaningless pet peeve: Grian says the hole requires exponentially more work each time it grows. But that would only be true if it e.g. doubled in size each time. It actually grows quadtratically, which is... still a massive pain to reset!

1,"Sounding noticeably better, Gem! Thanks for sticking with the series while under the weather. 

This has made me so nostalgic for early Minecraft (as frustrating as it could be sometimes). I've set up a new profile to play around with some Beta versions. I think I briefly played a friends copy of the last Beta version before release and didn't buy my own until 1.2.1, a version I thought was so feature rich compared to Beta! It's weird going back to those early versions after a few years of the super feature and content rich versions."

2,"GEM I FIGURED IT OUT
GEM PLEASE SEE THIS
These might be spoilers for the next sessions of Past Life, and Grian might be mad that you know (Maybe, I might be wrong), but whatever.




Every session has a gimmick from each life series
Episode 1: Normal Life Series (Third Life)
Episode 2: Boogeyman (Last Life)
Episode 3: Lives are tied together (I think) (Double Life)
Episode 4: You only have a certain amount of time (Probably like 8 hours or something) (Limited Life)
Episode 5: You have to do a task (and maybe no regen?) (Secret Life)
Episode 6: Wild cards (Wild Life!)

You see what I mean though right?"
0,If its big enough you could have several triggers spread across the hole with each pressure plate removing only a portion of the hole
0,"Watching this chaotic episode had me rolling on the floor, literally! I love every second of it! I think this life series will get players to red lives faster than any life series that exists now HAHAHAHA! That would be exaggerating, maybe, but setting up traps like this will make it possible! Great work, Villys! "

0,1:09:40 funniest line ever! 💀
1,"You don’t need to build with the slabs to get the petrified slabs in the future, you just have to craft slabs. When they made the change to slabs they just introduced a new block that was burnable  instead of changing the existing slabs people had been using"

0,Gem is.. kinda nice to etho... YOUR A VILLIAN GEM!!! BE ONE!
0,I would so love to see a mix up trap with a trapped chest sometime. Expecting the same thing will eventually not work. Making it look like a shop could also sell the trap more too. Love the content!
0,Oh its absolutely insane the amount of chaos such a simply trap caused. And the master manipulation in the beginning was truly iconic. No one is doing it like the villies
0,AN HOUR! my friday just got a whole lot better
0,"Hi gem, do you know if grian is planning to release the voice mod and other changes to these old versions to the public? Thanks"
0,"You are way too sweet, Gem, to be a villain just saying"
1,get well soon gem
2,"Hope u get better soon. But I love your crack voice , it soo cute"
2,"me, eyes and ears lore obsessed, when grian does anything: omg that’s so watcher of him"
1026,Love how Villain Gem is just making people feel sorry for her because of her voice
6,59:55 yeah it's a really good trap hahahaha
0,Your voice is a little better lol
0,"every time one of you said you're the bad guys my brain immediately went "" ... duh."" and then bopped."
0,silly villies
1,they are so team rocket ❤
0,"I remember hearing a while back that, where theirs redstone there are diamonds close by"
64,"I really want there to be a loose alliance between the Villies and the Cabin Boys so that Gem and Etho could potentially be the final 2 and have a duel to decide the winner. And then the Square Hole can eat the victor and it'll all come full circle, or rather, square."
0,is it just me or dose tango sound like mumbo for a minut at 1:00:08
0,58:50
0,"Big B's sly joke about skizz only starting minecraft last week, made me laugh so hard I choked on air and got tears in my eyes 😅🤣"
0,Gems VERY valid villan crashout 1:10:13
0,is tango secretly mumbo in this episode or am i actaully going crazy?
0,Gem in theory if you had enough signs could you line them up and set the tnt up somewhere else and set it off when everyone is standing there
3,Emo Pearl struggling to fit in wih the villies is my new favorite bit
186,"32:00 broke my heart honestly, as seeing gem and etho connect even though gem is supposed to be a villain is just such a cute scene <3"
0,The bdubs goes in...the SQUARE hole
0,...why is tango mumbo
0,"After Gem told Jimmy someone told her sounded like Jinx, I couldn't hear Gems voice anymore, only Jinxs, HELP"
1163,"Gem's inventory:
+4 saddles
+4 diamonds"
1489,30:15 gem and etho having a friendly cute chat while they hear explosions in the background and pay them no mind is the most beautiful thing ever i think
22,OMG OMG MUMBO IS HERE !! i mean tango just normal tango!! YAYY
0,37:31 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0,Why do the subtitles for Tango say that it's MUMBO speaking?
1,"This is my favorite episode so far and its only episode 2 ,i can't wait for the other episodes."
550,"“Im going to go hang out with Mumb- Tango.. i mean Tango!” -Grian.

Poor baby misses his BFF 😭"
0,6:12 what 😭
0,I mean I know you already have the lighthouse but a hot airballoon base would be very fitting and you could expand the square hole under it because the base would be floating (with like maybe a ladder to get up)
5,"I love the square hole, that was hilarious!"
117,"32:30 Etho: ""I was a big deal in the past"" .. BRO! you still are!! :D"
0,Are we going to see each season’s gimmicks as we move towards the future?
0,Where are the other's vids? Is this supposed to be posted?
0,Square hole supremacy 🙏
0,Posted just in time for me to eat my breakfast!! Thanks Gem!!
0,I have a feeling that the death square will be the trap of this life series that just keeps getting kills
10,"Can't lie, only recently discovered GeminiTay's channel and I absolutely adore her! She's great. I am totally not binge watching all of her series..no..💃"
0,"Yay, thanks for keeping it an hour long!"
0,50:59 And then Pearl's death message appears.
0,"Hi, here some tips for your sore throat. More to natural remedies hot teas. 

Tumeric + Honey.
Lime + Honey.
Lemon + Honey.
1 more kinda turned off for you is licorice."
19,sounds like Pearl's gonna go back to the Scarlet Pearl villain arc if the base stays how it is
1,thing is half the server are mincraft OG so random beta mechanics etho and bdubs are like yaa I remember that
2,Tango sounds a little different today...
530,I love how they keep calling their trap The Square Hole
11,"""The hole will get bigger with every death!!!!!!"" me : i love this plan 😂👍"
1,God too hear that your voice is getting better
0,Gods I love husky Gem so much
1946,Watching jinx join team rocket is something I didn't expect from the life series

0,48:56 Bdubs' Theme starts playing
2,Why is tango mumbo?
7,the square hole is a wonderful joke and i hope people keep falling in it
0,"prepare for trouble, and make it double"
0,Gem and Grian might have done more work on this hole than they have done to turn the Magic Mountain into a volcano
3,26:37 Gem.... just wait til you see one more HAHAHAHAH
0,"Instead of digging deeper, put some lava down the square hole xD"
0,"They truly are the best villains on the Server. 

The only villains on the server."
1,I was so confused at first when I heard Mumbo instead of tango 😂
0,"WHAT A CLIFFHANGER

1,"does this mean each next episode will be like a lige series..cause 3rd life we didint have anything, and last life we got the boogeyman..DOES THAT MEAN NEXT EP WILL BE DOUBLE LIFE WITH SOMEONE RANDOM???"
0,"Where do the players go?

That’s right! They go in the square hole!"
0,Putting fences under farmland make it so that it won't break from anything stepping on it.
0,is tango mumbo or something that cant be tango?
0,"I HEARD MUMBO, WHERE IS MUMBO?!!"
0,"Lol, grain gave up on having the boogyman automatic abandon of alliances since almost no one did it. Instead changed the rules to how the social interactions go. You can backstab if you want to"
5,Square hole might be one of my new favourite things 😂
0,48:07 is probably my favorite thing in the world
184,This is the only time I've seen a gamer get excited over grass
1,Poor gem I absolutely Hate how her voice is broken. but ..that still doesn't change how I love her vids❤❤
0,You are Adam Saddler with all the saddles
5,11:52 did anyone hear jimmy mess up 😭😭
14,square hole has to be the villies most team rocket trap that actually works like it does in the pokemon anime
5,Oh I never seen Grian so happy on his own trap. This is the first one of the first his trap works...
0,"So, can we all agree that Gem has a rose motif, Pearl a Nether one and Grian is just Dark Link or some sort of Ben Drowned?

Edit: I take it back, I like the team rocket idea"
0,im gonna miss this Bonnie Swanson version of Gem...
3479,I think the new voice actress for Gem is doing a good job. We just have to get used to it.
1,i was aboultely rolling with laughter this seasion was to good

0,Gem getting diamonds from everyone is so funny 😂😂😂
0,I thought they were gonna to go to Beta 1.8 next Beta 1.5 was only a few months after beta 1.2
0,"Should make your base as the floor of the square, with windows for a ceiling to watch them spat on top."
18,I'm laughing so much at them being such terrible villains and killing their ally that I'm actually getting lightheaded. I had to pause the vid for a minute just to regain my breath omg
0,This episode had me cackling can’t wait for next weeks already
0,"Just here to say thanks to Gem for pushing through her sickness to be in the series. Genuinely, thank you very much. Assuming she even reads her comments once it's past a hundred or so"
0,Has it become a server joke to give Gem saddles?
1,"on one hand glad your getting better and hope you continue to do so!
on the other hand... your lack of voice is making the already funny moments even funnier so at least your getting great content out of it lol"
1,That's right they go in the square hole
25,"11:51 Jimmy called you guys the willey

1,"25:40 
what if the boogyman traps YOUR base 
you are building traps for others but what if the boogyman traps one of the pressure plates on your base 
thats trouble for you"
0,They are technically red names in green name disguises
262,"""i don't have a smile on, i'm straight faced, cheese"" 😭 48:24
also TEAM ROCKET MENTIONED AHHHHH 1:02:15"
11,12:22 I would count this as being a villain because you are tearing apart a team from the inside using emotional manipulation.
5,Gem gave Bigb a flower. That is the equivalent of marriage in the life series
0,Gem needs to have a jinx skin next episode 😂
0,the base looks like it’s a rocket ship and it matches the team rocket theme

34,"Hey Gem, just wanted to thank you for dropping this episode a bit earlier than usual. I live in australia, so when most of the Life series episodes are uploaded, its usually an ungodly hour while I'm sleeping, and I'll have to wait for Saturday (which I don't have a lot of time for watching, sadly). Loving the Villies so far, and I can't wait to see how far you'll go! :)"

0,"pearl at 20:23 made me CACKLE ""it's quite dark in here!"" 😁"
0,I just realized the foreshadowing for the Square Hole in session 2 and 3 when they trapped Scar with the square hole and fence trick! Truly an evil and original plot for The Villains since session 1. It's so good!!
0,I AM SO GLAD THAT SOMEONE FINALLY USES SWORD PICKAXE AXE LIKE ITS SO USEFUL
0,This made me laugh so hard! 😂
0,Zombie Cleo is 45! What?!?
0,gem soundin like akwafina /j
0,"Gem's sick voice sounds like Katniss Everdeen from the hunger games! I love it, get well soon thou gem! ❤"
0,You sound like my favorite character Jinx from Arcane
0,"I love the chaos of starting a new server, it’s so entertaining"
0,Anyone else getting Princess Penelope from Wreck it Ralph vibes from Gems voice. Hope you feel better soon Gem!
0,3:00 yes
0,The colored + with names subtitles are so so amazing omg ! I always have troubles identifying voices

0,This is amazing cleo was so sweet to you even though you were manipulating her
0,My first base was in 1.7 and I had a stone peak digged out and windows all around. A ladder for a seci d floor and I had my crps there. Also a train track to my spawn point lol

0,Gem you sound like jinx from arcane in this episode I’m dying 😭
0,"""I'm going to internalize this"" 14:21"
1,Does anyone remember their being rice in Minecraft?
0,"I find it funny how bad they are at being villains considering that Pearl and Gem have both LITERALLY DONE IT BEFORE. Like no one’s forgotten how Gem was at the end of Secret Life and Wild Life and there’s DEFINITELY no one who’s forgotten Pearl in Double Life.

Also Bdubs actively talking quieter so Gem doesn’t have to strain her voice was really sweet."

love you gem😭"
1,I legitimately thought someone was recording for her at first lol
1,Oh wow my first build was also a jungle tree house
0,"OK, but can we agree if gem wins that her symbol will be eclipse cause literally her two teammates are the symbols of the moon and the sun and also the eclipse occurs once every seven years this will be the seventh winner(if we’re counting, simple life, and real life because Scott’s a two time winner) it’s also the unexpected darkness. I feel like that just fits gem!"
0,SHE SOUNDS LIKE JINX FROM ARCANE
0,"My guess for the past life winner is Etho. Not because of his early-mc skills, but the fact that every life series winner so far has won along side their double life partner. Grian and scar, third and secret. Scott and Pearl, last(simple) and double. Martyn and Cleo,  limited and real. Joel is th only who isn't paired and since he was in double life, Etho. This was my prediction before the concept of lastlife was released, and is still my prediction."

0,"otary Members: Falun Gong Practitioners Are Admirable

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS) and a quality engineer in the U.S., said that he had learned about the CCP’s live organ harvesting when he attended a meeting in Houston, where a Falun Gong practitioner talked about her experience of being forced to work for no pay and having her blood drawn in a forced labor camp.

Troy Stansell, a member of the Rotary Action Group Against Slavery (RAGAS)

After watching the film, he was both sad and angry. Mr. Stansell said, “It’s really hard to accept that there’s a country and a government behind this. We rely on the government to protect us and guard us, but a government is doing this. It’s really heartbreaking, frustrating, infuriating, and sad.

“Those who stick to their beliefs deserve our admiration. They endure all kinds of torture and do not abandon their beliefs. This really makes many of us ashamed.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club from Kansas, U.S., finished watching the movie in tears. “This is so heartbreaking. I can’t bear it,” she said. “This is so shocking, it’s hard to believe this is true, it’s hard to believe this kind of thing can happen in the world.”

Ann Barr, a member of the Rotary Club’s Community Action Against Human Trafficking Club

Rolf Thingvold, a Rotarian and senior sales executive at a large Norwegian software company, said “State Organs” was a very moving and powerful story and that the organizers had done a great job. He also understood that “the filmmakers took a big risk.”

0,"Shiny duo reunion ark? (+Grian) But in all seriousness this is a good team lol, Gem's gaslighting, Pearl's unhinged-ness, and Grian's chaotic gremlin energy as they all try desperately to be the villains this season will be very funny.

The ""Lost Generation"" refers to the generation that came of age during and after World War I, particularly those who experienced disillusionment and alienation due to the war's impact.

0,"Poor Gem... as the Maintenance Supervisor for a major hotel since before Covid hit, even with the greatest care and precautions, vaccines and boosters, I was still so exposed to the public that I ended up catching it at least FIVE (confirmed) times, several others kinda maybe-ish. 🙀

I DEFINITELY understand what you're going through. I'm certainly glad you're on the mend. Your age helps a lot with that 😺

But more importantly your voice WILL come back to normal. Worst case you may occasionally get the random odd tickle in your throat. But you'll be alright. 😻"
0,omg a kids next doort tree house with light house on top of it....

1,Since your main base has the theme of time you should make a clock tower. (It sounds cool to me)
2,Gem’s voice actually makes it feel more like a 2011 Minecraft video.
7,"Some people won’t understand how relatable it is to see people try to be the villain in a game, but struggling so hard they constantly need to remind themselves that villains aren’t usually polite, apologetic, and nice at all times."
4,"30:02 
Why are people not talking about this moment? She sounds so sad and broken. I know it’s probably roleplay, but I want to hug her so badly regardless ❤"
0,this kinda makes me want to like start smoking cigarettes again or something so i can always sound like her /gen

I thought it would be cool if Gems audience saw this idea"
1,They should hold a rose (then poppy) in their inventory this season like team rocket LOL

Gem, Pearl, And Grian Went From The Avengers To The Villains In episode one-"
16,Some YouTubers returned to their early minecraft skins. Gem returns to early Minecraft voice recording volumes.
0,Crazy idea incoming! You should ask Grian if you could do a series called “Virtual Life” where you’re playing as a minecraft character whilst playing as a minecraft character (this is super hard to explain) so it’s like you’re laying in Minecraft like normal but then you also get to playing in Minecraft like a game inside a game. (Idk if that made sense but yea that’s my life series idea :)
1,Gems sick voice sounds like Uraraka from MHA 😅
0,"Grian said in his video that they'd play until they reach the newest version. That would be like 18 episodes... Mayne theres additions lile gifting lives to help ppl live? The clock was going backwards... Will the last video be back to beta??

0,"This is a trio I have been wanting to happen so badly. Even better when Grian is just like ""Let's just be the villains, people are scared of being the villain""

Meanwhile Pearl in Double Life:"
0,"Have you ever seen someone handle hatchling snakes? Most of them are super chill but some are so sassy and they try to bite you even tho they have no teeth so they just bump you with their tiny head and they hiss but it just sounds super cute cause they are so smoll.

92,"Grian, Pearl, Jimmy - ""WE'RE BURNING BUILDINGS EPISODE ONE"" **general chaos in the house**
Gem: **calmly farms**"
0,"Your kidding!, i had no idea this was todayyyyy !!!"
0,"I don't think they'll see this but I think. A cool Base idea could be if they're going to like do the lighthouse with each material if section being like a new block from each update. And since two of their original builds were trees they can like add two trees on either side of the lighthouse that like wind up the sides of the lighthouse and they can be made of all the new added woods so it starts out with oak and then you change it to the next newest tree so on and so forth until you reach the leaves and they can just be like a bunch of different kinds of leaves.😊 I think like it would give the lighthouse like an old factor to it which might lean into like a villain hideout place or a 'Villy' hideout
.
And I feel like really bad villains works out to be an amazing gimmick. Like you're so bad at it you're good at it is what I'm getting from all of this? Like they plan to do one thing bad it completely backfires and butterfly effects into something worse that they do which is just so cool😂❤ hope  gems voices gets better"

0,GEM! The reason your throat is sore is because it is inflamed.I learned from my last few flus and colds. You need cold things. Ice-cream is a big one! Try it. Trust me. Cold on hot throat. No hot. Just cold for a while. And a cold cloth on the outside of it. You will feel better. Works!!

0,Glad you're already feeling better even if your voice isn't there yet. I'm also incredibly sick so the life series releasing is perfect comfort.
1,"Being honest, I didn’t realize that this was actually Gem. Because when people are sick or can’t record they’ve had subs before, I genuinely thought that Gem’s sick voice was another person and they were doing the whole “I’m totally Gem, just have a sore throat” thing. All seriousness, I hope you get well soon"

3,11:00 “it’s because I watched captainsparklez!” She sounds like a little kid omg
1,Gem sounds like amethyst from Steven Universe
0,"ngl this is probably the most boring gimmick in life series. Secret life is the BEST cause I get excited on what the Lifers would get as a secret. But this? I can already imagine what will happen in the next episodes. When nether will be added, people go to nether someone will die in the lava or piglins. The same thing with Deep Dark. And so on. I can already imagine what would happen. Unlike Secret Life or Wild Life, there's a suspense.



PS. Gem is great"
0,you sound like katnis everdeen 😂😂😂 12:46

0,How many lifers are gonna come up with this idea of adding a layer on their base for every update to the game and how many of them will actually stick to it? Also how many of them are gonna make “time traveling ___?” Only time will tell
0,"I just want to point out how true your statements are. Being bad does come with consequences. The good fights back. So being bad is HARD, it requires conscious effort. Thing is though, bad guys win WAY more than you'd expect. Indeed, the bad won before we even started standing upright. All the good can do is beat back the flames."

4,"everyone walking all over the crops and constantly having to retill hurt my soul a bit. It's probably very niche information, but back in the beta, crops had a chance to get trampled when anything walked on them. Not jumping, just walking. Crouching made no difference. It made farming tedious, you couldn't just fill entire fields with wheat, you had to carve paths into the farms to prevent having to constantly retill everything"

This is a sincere request: please don’t overexert yourself, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep to support your immunity. Your subscribers will always be here—after all, clicking that subscribe button is permanent! 😄

Taking a short break from YouTube won’t make your well-wishers go away. Just upload a quick update about your health, and focus on getting the rest you need. 💛"

0,Its pains me when gem never understands a pop culture reference
0,"Xen-42 made a Canadian mod, and it's adorable. I hope you see this comment because you need to know."
0,How do you not know clippy 😮📎
0,Why does Stitch have a 200 over it? Did it just eat the cherry fruit in Pac-Man?
0,"Geeeeemmmmm, you need to put this in the season ten playlist, I didn't even realize that this video was out because it wasn't there😭😭"
0,LoL to be fair I've not used Clippy (as I'm a tad younger then you) but I do know OF him XD
0,Great video!
0,My baby sisters are like 6 year younger and they totally would've thought map from Dora too. I feel Grian's pain.
0,How do you not know Clippy?
0,I know clippy and I was born 2009
0,"If your base were say in Empires, what would its name be? Can't wait to see the finished product."
1,"It's always nice to see you work and procrastinate by doing other type of work. I think it's a really good way to deal with the ""too much same thing"" 

The terrain look great !"
0,"Yeahhhh, me watching this video is my procrastination. I definitely don't have things to do......."
0,"sniffers are ancient dinos, which is why you can find them buried in sus sand and why they dig up ancient flowers."
0,I wondered what that was in his vod..
0,"Hermitcraft is like the inspiration every Minecraft player feels when they want to build, but the members of Hermitcraft actually go through with it whilst everyone else just gives up"
7,You sound great Gem. I sure hope you don’t get sick!!!😔
0,Gem most my family is older than you what?! I’m closer to your age than my youngest uncle!
0,Get well soon gem! Sending prayers! We'll wait for you to get enough rest! Don't over exert yourself!
0,I cant wait to see you with the copper golems 😅🩷
1,3:43 HANDY MANNY REFERENCE
0,"34 : 37  In Tango's Vod you can zoom in to the bottom right corner to see you standing there with the tag, But the better one is 37 : 21 you get the tag in there clearly XD"
1,Gem ur base is the cover for the hermitcraft 8 map
0,=)
0,Anyone else eagerly waiting the next One Block episode?
0,scar looking solid in this epizode
1,I'm younger then Gem and I immideatly thought of clippy xD
0,"Hi Gem! I really love your videos, they always make me laugh.

I have a question for you, or for anyone who wants to answer. I’m wanting to be a gaming YouTuber as well and I was wondering if you have any tips? Or how you even record your videos in the first place 😅? I’m new to using laptops and computers and stuff

Please and thank you, hope you have a wonderful rest of your day 😊"
0,The thing that came to my mind was pickle rick from rick & morty (no I've never watched it I only know it from the memes)
1,"If a path is not straight, there needs to be a reason. Humans take the shortest way.

edit: yep, there's a sniffer pen in the way."
0,So if u were 1 in 97 your what 29 now?
0,you were not tagged. You were clippied.
0,Happy 2m subscriber🎉🎉🎉🎉
0,YESSSS FAV TYPE OF VIDEO
1,"Okay so hear me out, the area near the jungle that's kind of bordering Gem, Pearl, Skizz and Tango, what I wouldn't give for a cute little Group Collab once the terrain is kind of close to being done to get the terrain all finished and cohesive cause its looking so good"
0,"I'm 24, born 2000, And I'm British, I know Clippy, feel humbled 😝😂 but no in all seriousness it could just be a very niche reference 😂"
0,Please!!!! Stop putting tinted  glasses  I  can't see anything!!!!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
0,Hi Gem! New subscriber here. My daughter has been watching you for quite some time. Love your content!! She asked me to follow so that I could ask if you will be continuing your One Block series. Thanks for all that you do! ❤
0,Maybe the guardians attack you and fish just get caught in the crossfire
0,❤🎉
0,"When grian pulled out the tag and gem didn’t know what it was, i screamed at my screen, “ITS CLIPPY AHHHHH”"
0,gem was born in 96? i feel old t.t
0,"There's one more pretty major thing Gem's procrastinating, but I don't blame her for trying not to show it in any of the clips if the camera angle allowed her to avoid it. 😅

Still, we could do with an atmosphere/vibe reminder once you think you've got a good thematic update point. The new builds need to be seen through the effects of the dim lighting, and sinister fog."
0,Omg gem i know who clippy is but im 7 years younger than you
0,Maybe Snifers are still mammals with their eggs. Platypus and echidna lay eggs.
0,Man now I wanna terraform on my Hardcore world haha
0,💗💜💗
0,12:29 ... i got jumpscared
0,I finally caught up on all the episodes. Yay!
0,"Dont worry Grian, im 21 yo and i DO KNOW clippy very well"
0,that was great! i love when terrain is improved.
0,It would be cool if this HC world comes to the marketplace if they decide to do it
0,"I haven’t seen anyone else saying this, but the tag reminds me of handy manny, and maybe gem’s referring to him aswell!"
0,"Wait, you were born in 1996? You are as old as my DAUGHTER!"
0,One?  Well if Apple had it's way you would already be on your third iPhone.   :p
0,"Hi Gem do you play league of legends, you kina sound like aurora, anyway love you video's ❤"
0,"“There’s a sniffer investigating the house…. Is it… is it all up to code?” 😂
Love you Gem, I’ve been watching you since I was 9 and I am 16 now!❤"
0,"Clippy was introduced in Office 97, BUT was in office until Office 2003, which had support through 2014. That's 17 years of Clippy"
6,"Me and my girlfriend have a minecraft world together and I was building some rocks in our fairy village when she asked me how I know how to build rocks, I told her it is inspired by your terraforming. I love your builds <3"
1,"Hi Gem, my daughter has been pestering me to write you a comment to see if you liked her fan art she emailed you on 23rd Feb 25 and 17th May 25. 😊"
0,"""I was alive in '97, but I would've been 1""

*feels my friggen age* omg

Also the Green-shirt guy you're thinking of was probably Blue's Clues Steve. Not the miner. The cool dude that celebrates getting letters"
0,Ya Know you and all of hermitcraft are on the minecraft store option in minecraft
0,"Gem, I'm 28 and I know Clippy. Also, Blue's Clues was in the same era as Clippy. Wow, I sound old. lol"
0,I just realized you hit 2M subs. Congrats! 🎉🥳
0,When will you start a new survival series for the Chase the Skies update? 😭 I love watching your series while I play in my own world so I don’t have to feel like I’m playing alone lol
0,I love that gem never says like and sub every episode
0,When are you going to upload a hardcore vidio again
1,one cool thing you could do is just have a grave yard that says experiment 500 or maybe a map art saying 0 days since last casualty in the lab
1,"ALL GEN Z´S WHO KNOW CLIPPY
 I
 I
V"
0,"Congrats on 2 million!!!!
❤❤❤"
0,Poor Grian…… I’m feeling your pain…. lol
0,"I really, really love the base! Good job, you should be proud of yourself!"
0,The level of composure you all have just NOT mining all that coal when I starve for it most of the time I play.
0,you made so much progress in this episode! it looks amazing <3
0,I was born in 2000 and even I knew who clippy was 😂
0,"How come the pumpkin texturepack isn't part of the server texture pack? I often see hermits not having it installed, seems it would be easier just to have it on the server"
0,Gem how long have you had auto jump on?
0,I need more skyblock😭😭😭
0,yoo the pale oak logs is genius!!
2,Green shirt and crayon is probably Steve from blues clues
0,"About Terrain and Water: water flow from rivers, lakes, and similar in nature does NOT like to split; it will follow the one path of least resistance until it reaches a pooling point (or sea). Water courses may split up but that's ultimately a temporary solution that will inevitably lead back to the regular one-path logic."
0,Gem the great is great.
0,How DARE you not remember Steve from Blue’s Clues
2,I love Dora's Map's iconic green shirt and crayon
1,"I think you were thinking of blues clues. Unless it's more regional, also as a fellow 96 I know clippy but barely"
1,"That moment when Grian said ""clippy"" and I saw it and I immediately felt so old because I'm old enough to remember when they introduced him as a terribly down cgi paper clip."
1,"I'm so glad you're still doing this season, this is definitely one of my favorites and your base is just SO cool"
0,"Gem's terraforming: Gem herself couldn't say it any better ""That's Amazing!"""
0,I was born in 1999 and I do know Clippy from my grandpa's workshop computer in 2008...
0,"Wow, Grian unlocked a core memory for me lol. I used to love using clipart in MS Word just for fun"
0,omg scar not using dirt
0,Question: What Happens To These Awesome Worlds When The Hermitcraft Seasons Are Over? Like Does He Sell Them? (Just Curious Because I'm Sure There Are Plenty Of People Who'd Love To Have Y'alls Art)!!!
0,Grian did have a bright idea of using in is potions to tag someone could be useful for future targets like false whos fully aware and making sure she would never be tagged
0,"This version of tag has got me constantly _only personally_ putting on my rules layering hat. And that is kinda an attempt at lampshading? Or in other words I know people don't like rules lawyers but I hope it's only when they don't say stuff like this.

I paused right after False asked Gem if she had a tag, and my first reaction was people shouldn't be able to just generically call out that someone might be trying to tag. They should see the tag or outright accuse, so Gem could have said no, left, then False sees it in editing and is tagged. But I guess if False sees Gem way in the background in game then asks if it's for tagging then it does count as a False thwarting a Gem in tag. I guess I've outlined, for me, an ambiguity, and concluded, again personally, that it was indeed a thwarting. This has been rules lawyering _in theory_ and please don't hold it against me lol, if you wouldn't join in."
0,"The last MS Office version that Clippy (or Microsoft Assistant) was in was MS Office 2003, which was only superseded by MS Office 2007!! I'm only a year younger than you, and I remember Clippy being all over the place!!!"
0,You did such a great job on all these little details. I find your videos oddly relaxing
1,"The Guardians should only attack Pufferfish, Dolphins and Axolotls."
1,Clippy will never be forgotten.
1,"Yeah, to be fair, Clippy was retired in 2003 after six very irritating years. So unless you were using Microsoft word when you were 7, or using an old PC with an older version of Office on it, you probably wouldn't know Clippy. He was,... * very* annoying.

With regards to Sniffers not being Mammals, Platypus are mammals, as are Echidna, they are Monotrmes and they all lay eggs. I choose to assume that sniffers are also Monotremes, and are a bigger, fluffier, previously extinct relative of the platypus."
0,Grian thinking he's too old but honestly I feel like I may be too young because I fully thought of Map from Dora the Explorer when I first saw the tag design.
0,"Gem not knowing who Clippy is made my back creak. Gem calling my boi Steve ""the guy in the green shirt with he crayon"" gave me grey hairs."
0,Gem I would give my left arm for a shred of your terraforming ability
0,"Invis scar with a head and an elytra had me 🤣🤣🤣 so funny!!!
Loving your base this season Gem ❤"
0,monotremes are egg laying mammals. so if sniffers have milk and lay eggs they would be monotremes as well.
0,"That moment grian realise that he is getting old with that clippy comment 😅 
I felt that tho and gem just got way younger in my mind than i first thought 😂"
0,Love how Scar basically just dropped the price in half for those sniffer eggs lol
0,Sniffers are monotremes
0,ahhhh i love to see some love for the sniffers !! Theyre my favorite mob :D
0,i think the reason why ur base is smaller is because 25 of the 35 videos were spent just talking to hermits (wich is totally fine but it is a diffirent pace to the last seasons)
0,Couldn’t you put it in an armor stand?
0,I thought you were thinking of Blues Clues. 'Guy with the green shirt and the crayon' is forever Steve for me.
1,Disappointed that Gem thinks Sniffers aren’t mammals because they lay eggs! GEM! They are obviously Australian and related to the platypus and the echidna!
0,Aren't sniffers some sort of platypus based animal? A semi aquatic egg laying mammal.
0,Gem not knowing clippy is the most gem thing
0,"I’m from year 06 and even I know Clippy, I feel old and young, but mostly old,(hooray popping knees and bad!) baffling"
0,"My only knowledge of clippy comes from the animator vs animation videos, but at least I knew of it"
1,I feel so old... I know Clippy.
0,The paperclips with eyes clipy
0,"5:26
Pearl isn't tagged anymore, she tagged Scar, don't forget.

12:29
😂

15:49
You should take a look at the board near the POE HQ, there are updates to the Tag rules.

22:51
I checked, guardians attack players, squids and axolotles.

26:20
There are mammals that lay eggs.
But there are no species of mammals that have 3 pairs of legs."
1,According to the minecraft wiki apparently guardians did attack fish but only in bedrock 1.4-1.5. They stopped being hostile to fish in 1.6.0 and from what it says on the wiki it doesn't look like they were ever hostile to fish in java edition or legacy console
0,"hey, im from NL too!"
0,How come you do not have a newfie accent?
0,Always enjoy a Gem video 🔥💓💎
0,I was born in 2005 and I know clippy but only because of the Internet.
0,Maybe you both thought guardians kill fish because they can drop cod when they die
0,Gem reminding everyone we're old now.
0,24:51 scar is LEANING
0,So proud of your terraforming gem! I try and want to do that and have ideas that looks nice and struggle putting them into reality but watching you learn this season is inspiring and makes me want to try harder
0,I never saw the Blue Clue’s episode where Dora’s map visited
0,Genini tay as anyone told you about Jesus if not can I?
0,Gem not knowing who Clippy is... 🤣
0,"Green shirt and crayon sounds like Blue's Clues, which... I can see it. Like Salt and Pepper and Soap."
0,I'm not surprised Gem never used microsoft word I'm surprised she never seen pregnant clippy
0,I knew it was clippy immediately! Hahaha
1,So you basically gave scar 32 Diamonds for guardians and got half of them back for sniffer eggs😂 thats the Funniest thing Ive seen all day
0,Gem whats the song called on clip 9:24? I really ❤ that song and want to know what it's called if that's posible.
0,im still baffled that gem made it all the way thru school without clippy!
6,The transition between bases is one of my favorite parts of season 10! Everything looks amazing!
2,It might look better to switch out the aquarium glass with clear. You could see your pets that way.
0,Love the video! My girlfriend and I are really missing the one block series. She needs it badlyy
0,Confirmed yay!! Gem is the same age as me!!
0,gem we can't check tango's vod if we don't know which one it was
0,He reminds me of clippy 3:54
22,24:26 I could listen to scar and gem shenanigans for hours. Your sarcasm and his goofiness goes so well together.
0,I guess sniffers are kinda like a platypus?? 😂
94,the scene of grian and gem both muted and smacking the shit out of each other for no reason is perfect sibling energy
0,Chat always snitches.
1,"9:58 I was born in 1996, and I used Clippy for years. I instantly knew what Grian was thinking of when he first asked."
0,OMG PEARL
0,"Idea: Base swap. There hasn't been a base swap since season 7. Gen didn't get to participate. With season 10 being at its peak, I think base swap should come back."
1,"TRIVIA;
Did you Know that Gem uploaded her Episode 18 on June 22, 2024, Titled as Little Details.. Exactly 1 year and 5 days ago..
(Philippine Time and Date)"
0,You probably won’t answer this comment but does Java have a camera bobbing setting? I know bedrock does and I makes it feel more alive when walking and not like your gliding across the ground
1,girl i was born in 2001 and even i knew clippy so idk what happened that you didn't (it could be my parents having word etc from a cd? i don't know how old that cd was)
0,"Wonderful terraforming! But, ahem. Gem the captions at 19:31 do not say ""crab pots""."
0,"I found that if you alternate fence posts and walls around the sniffers, then make the corners fences but miss the corner block. You can go in and out with ease, but sniffers are too big to pass them."
0,What about the warden on the monster mouth? 😢
0,"Blues Clues is what you meant, gem!  Puff puff"
1,Weirdly platypuses lay eggs and are mammals.
0,12:04 We are all astounded by the amount this episode it was AMAZING especially since some of us have seen your streams on these
0,"Clippy 😮 die gaf jou een rondleiding bij het starten voor de eerste keer van word office 97 😅 ook tijdens het installeren van office97..
Dang it.. at that time i was 21"
0,"Hey! I'm ZaniGamer, a small Minecraft YouTubeer who loves peaceful SMPs and survival builds 💖 I don't use discord, but I would really love to join your server if there's another way to apply. I'm active, friendly, and would love to record videos too!"
0,congrats on 2M gem
11,4:07 it reminded me of clippy too and I’m 18 lol
0,"Hey, Gem...

Proud of you."
0,There is potential to connect Tango's path to the path to Pearl's base to connect him up even more
91,"Yep, you did indeed tag Tango! Chat eventually snitched, but they did so too late (also Grian's rules update said chat catching the Tag doesn't count)."
0,"What i learned today is that chicken are mamals in Minecraft, when you bread them it make a baby directly."
1,I'm even younger than you both G&G and I know Clippy T_T
0,"Don’t worry grian. I know clippy and I’m younger then both of you (25,UK)"

I can no longer hear the able sisters music without thinking “Tommyinnit theme”"
0,FINNISH THE SKULL PLEASE!
1,"Doesn't know Clippy.

Bloody kids."
0,Thanks for making me feel old Gem.
0,I’m 15 and I know clippy
0,"Gem i have sort of a weird request, so both my parents are in a musical (the musical is come from away) and idk if you have heard of it but it is set in newfoundland and you are from newfoundland (I think) so do you have any tips for sounding  like you are from newfoundland"
0,"Thank you,  THANK YOU, Gem, for teaching Scar how to Sniffer! Lord knows he doesn't read his comments!"
0,Gem! Gem! Gem! sniffers are not mammals because they lay eggs you are correct which makes them platypy which means you need to name one Perry and then possibly deliver another one named Perry to stress monster!
0,The sniffer noises sound like belugas
0,I'm 26 and I immediately recognized that he was similar to clippy
0,Gem im from the 00s and i know clippy too and all the other idiots in word
1,The sniffer eggs were a great idea to pay Scar. Lately the Mob Boss has been asking for favours in payment rather than diamonds.
0,3:20 Handy Manny?
0,I am younger than you but even I know clippy
0,cue austin powers... it kinda looks like a ...
0,Am I the only one who thought the Tag reminded me of 'Mr. PoopyButthole' from Rick and Morty?? 😅
1,I'm proud of you.
0,"If Grian could hear me, I would let him know that I, as a 20-year-old, know what Clippy is. I am American, if that changes anything"
0,"Next time you have the ""Tag"", you could wonder around the edges of someone's stream, but while wearing your lab coat as your cover.  You did it before when you were ""researching"" other hermits, so that could help you disguise your purpose for being there :)"
0,Clippy went away in 2007 I think. So you would have probably been in elementary school. You make landscaping look so easy Gem.
0,Gem you absolutely ate with the editing of this episode!
0,inspector sniffer. there is a sniffer name XD
0,HOW DONT YOU KNOW ABOUT CLIPPPYYY
0,I put the pro into procrastination

0,jemini
0,gem zipping by the window absolutely sent me😭
1,Hi Gem! I wanted to tell you that I played Dredge because of your streams of it and the lore of your base! I just wanted to thank you for an awesome new game :D
0,Such a great episode!
0,26:22 us aussies are like… there’s alest two mammals that lay eggs. Echidnas and platypus.
1,"3:20 Don't worry gem, the first thing that came to MY mind when grian asked if it reminds you if something was the markers that skizz and martyn had built in a guess the build video 😭😭"
1,12:05 I’m proud of you and your terraforming! Far more talented at it than I am!😅
0,Don’t worry Grian I know who clipy is
0,26:18 i guess they’re insects?  They have 6 legs and lay eggs that need to hatch in specific conditions
0,My take is that sniffers are dragons -- they have six limbs and are reminiscent of both reptiles and mammals!
1070,Lovely bit of terraforming in these trying times
0,Name the sniffers! You gotta get some nametags to name the sniffers!!!
0,"Gem I was born in 97 and I know Clippy! Also, totally love how Scar runs the mob business but you just sold him 4 sniffer eggs!"
3,"Gem, how many hours did it take you to do all that terraforming? It looks great!"
0,Tbf i knew about clippy and i'm younger than you... so idk
0,Clippy
0,"3:20 When I was watching this from Grian's perspective, I thought you were thinking of Gumby. The little green clay guy from that old show... Especially because he's EXTREMELY FORGETTABLE!

[I literally had to Google ""That little green/blue clay guy who was recently in that car commercial"" to find out what his name was]"
0,nah not knowing clippy is crazy
0,TENNISSS!!!
0,I am so proud of you.
0,the base is brought together so much by that terraforming
0,Everyone is finishing their bases because End season is Near
0,I absolutely love your videos gem your an amazing Minecraft and such an inspiration ❤
0,"Your terraforming abilities are top notch, don't be so hard on yourself! Looks marvelous!"

0,I'm 17 and I know Clippy
0,"Thank you for the tip on making cliffs. ❤
Your base is looking so cool. I keep thinking that I wouldn't want to go walking in your base at night. 😵‍💫😁😆"
23,"4:45 Come on Gem, we're the same age! Clippy was an integral part of my childhood, you're making ME feel old now!"
1,"""i would have been ONE."" i am turning to dust as i watch, good lord 🥴 one day i won't have an age-related crisis while watching a Minecraft YouTube video!!
Clippy was definitely iconic, though. everybody hated his guts, but he was an icon for sure 😹"
1,"The sniffers are so cute, I thought they were going to invade the house. Love the new aquarium additions"
0,the skin change makes me believe that the new life series is being filmed
0,For God's sake am I the only one who saw the disorganised barrel
0,Scar is going to appreciate those sniffers so much! He has an order pending for sniffers for Ren and was planning on an ocean expedition. ...I think we all know sniffer archaeology is not Scar-safe. 😂
0,that's not a too old thing thats a gem is like an alien to english pop culture
0,<3
2,"22:50 I'm pretty sure they attack squids, or at least used to do so, that was a thing since before 1.13 so I guess when more stuff started swimming by you didn't notice what exactly was getting attacked"
0,I wish they did the base swap again.
0,Scar seriously needs to get a happy ghast to transport mobs with
0,"I would like to point out that Gem is older than me and I worked side-by-side with Clippy many a time in my life.

This is not an age thing, it's a cultural awareness thing."
0,"You did it Gem! You tagged Tango (Hermitcraft - EPIC TENNIS with 6
Hermits!) at 37:20!!!"
0,YASSSSS ARE QUEEN HAS REACHED 2 MILLION 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
0,I moved out of my parents in 97 I feel sooooo old

0,Best opening of the season 🎉
1,"ah yes time to watch gem do tasks, while i ignore mine"
0,Love how two to three years isn't long ❤
5,19:10 I don’t know if “bowls” is a genuine mistake or Dot (Gem’s captioner) just didn’t want to type “balls”
0,GG
0,"You were born in 1996, the year I met the love of my life. We’ve been together the entirety of your life. God I’m old."

0,Gem plss get a beacon it will make the tera forming job sm faster
0,I know the tag is supposed to be Clippy. But just. I. I- ......I can't be the only one thinking it looks a little........ y'know.
0,"C'mon, Gem, I wasn't even alive in 2000 and I know Clippy!"
0,"CLIPPY! Clippy was annoying, so I changed it to the Robot thing… damn, I’m old!"
0,I feel you Grian! As soon as I saw the tag I was like 'Oh Clippy!' Then Gem over here kept hitting us in the Olde. T_T
0,TANGO GOT TAGGED!
5,25:01 Invisible Scar wearing a Scar head is nightmare fuel.
0,i think the sniffer is a dinosaur or phrehistoric mamal of some sort
0,You unintentionally tagged Skizz during his recent livestream
1,The patches of dirt in the sniffer pen makes it look like they were diggin there and it's actually so cool
0,"Gem, your are definitly too young if you dont know clippy 😂❤"
0,The only reason I know about Clippy is because of the Clippy's Revenge chapter from one of Ben Orlin's books.
0,2:33 SIBLINGS they're so siblings
0,I can't believe that Gem is so uncultured as to not know who Clippy is.
1,Brooo clippy has made tag soooo much better. Good on ya grian.
0,Its definitely more the map than clippy!!
0,"Hehe! Clippy! Yee,, Grian is old. And i am old enough to know it 😂"
0,26:18 well neither are chickens but they just live birth in this world apparently
0,"I remember Clippy from MS Office 2000 Professional. AFAIK, it's the last version Clippy appeared in by default, Clippy was then disabled by default in MS Office 2003, and ultimately removed in MS Office 2007. I kinda miss him. I believe you're just a month away from my birthday. How did you not meet Clippy?"
0,CLIPPY!!!
0,Im 22 years old and even I know who clippy is. It's pretty weird to think of the random things we learn that others don't.
0,12:04 we are very proud of you jem for all your terraforming
2,"The pale oak looks amazing on your terraforming, it looks a little corrupted, which for Dredge I think it is a small detail that adds a lot to the vibe!"
0,"SO PROUD GEM!! Ya did it again sis, Werkk!"
1,Gem not knowing Clippy is so cursed tho
0,:)
0,"Lol, I completely forgot about Clippy! You've made me feel old! I agree, it looks just like Map from Dora the Explorer!
Trees are part of the terrain! 🤣"
1,I feel like the stonecutter should do damage if you stand on it(like magma blocks do)
0,37:21 on tango's vod!! he's been tag!!
1,"Gem, yes Clippy was introduced in ‘97 but he wasn’t retired till ‘07 so you would have been old enough (10-11) to interact with it. Age doesn’t seem to be the issue here 😂

Edit: Also there is a mammal that makes eggs so it could be one 🤷🏻‍♂️ Maybe it’s relatives of the platypus 😂"
0,"Wait, you're a couple years older than me, and you dont know Clippy‽ Oh, man, Clippy was a wonderful, friendly menace. You missed out. 

Please tell me you're at least familiar with Space Cadet Pinball?"
0,Hi Gem Love your videos but the new keyboard sounds make it really hard for me with misophonia to watch
0,3:20 i though she was talking abt gumby lol
0,Gem how do you NOT know who Clippy is??? I'm a year younger than you and I'm far too familiar with him! Did you never do ICT lessons in school?
0,"Just started a new world with a friend
Watching you berrying* the coal during the terraform hurt my soul"
2,Tango posted it!
0,"12:01 I am INDEEEEED proud of you, Gem! You did so well! 💚"
0,why am i not surprised that gem doesn't know who clippy is
8,"3:45 When I first saw that tag, I thought it looked like the crayons with eyes 😂"
0,congrats on 2 mil gem!!
1,"Sorry, if you were 1 in ‘97 you’re my age, and I distinctly remember how annoying clippy was in the computer labs in elementary school lol. I think it may not be an age thing, just a you thing!"
1,How do you NOT know clipy :|
1,Gem was so productive this vid! It's another level of satisfying when one thing after the other keeps getting done!! Proud of Gem :)
0,when the youtubers i watch dont know who mr clippy world destroyer is....I feel like i just earned a few grey hairs.
1,You should make a cool habitat for the 🐌 snails❤
0,Videos like yours are a great watch after work when you are tired haha. Love it Gem! Awesome as alwaysssssss
0,You’re thinking of map from Dora the explorer
0,"X'D its wild that apparently I'm younger than Gem but do remember seeing Clippy in word, guess I just messed around with an older version of it or something"
0,"Nice episode, thanks for the update."
0,That's some huge progress this episode! The terrain looks amazing ❤
0,i was SCREAMING clippy
65,"An idea for a bit of terrain between your base and where Grian is building his near-infinite wheat fields. Is there a spot that's mostly out of line-of sight that you could build a small stone quarry? To ""explain"" where the original inhabitants mined the rock for the Castle? I think this would add to the environmental story of the area, and give you a theme for the texture/terrain on that edge of the base. It might even make sense if the edge of one of Grian's farms has ""taken over"" a part of the old Quarry. (maybe the farm has repurposed an old Quarry Dock on the water?)"
0,Gem I genuinely tho7ght you were talking about Steve from Blues Clues and not The Map from Dora 😭
49,"i really loved this videos editing, like the little voice overs, like how it was here: 8:22 when you were like “oh where am i going” idk! i just really like the personality in the editing and would love to see that more! thank you for always making great videos for us gem <3"
0,I wasn’t born in 97 but I would’ve been 1???? Help what does this mean
0,Gem made me feel old when she didn't know Clippy... And she's a few months older than me...
0,"26:00 all mammals make eggs, not all of the are external though, but platypus' are a thing"
0,"When you breed sniffers you don't get a baby, you get an egg. Sniffers aren't mammal like ... chicken."
0,guardians only attacked fish for a short time during 1.13 btw
0,"did you hear about the newfie character in the new game ""Date everything""?"
1,This was uploaded on my birthday :)
0,"good episode! terrain is looking a lot better, and i hope you got tango!"
0,Guardian don’t attack fish. They do attack squids though.
0,false tag wont count cuz she called you out. tango might work tho. the tag technically is visible in the clip
0,Am i missing something with the hat?? Or is it just a fun gift?
1,"can confirm, tango is tagged"
0,"12:03 with how the path curves there, it might make sense to put a small obstacle to curve around, like a depression or a small hill!"
0,You should put that hat on top of the salmon head that’s in that room 21:18
1,16:56 StalkerTay 😂
0,microsoft word paperclip
1,One in 1997… Now I feel so old!
0,Microsoft office was introduced in 97!!! God I can feel my self turning into dust....
5,"The mangrove tree you did looks really good, i like how the roots get darker as they get closer to the water"
1,"Sniffers could be mammals of the platypus kind. lol they are meant to be ancient creatures right? (I havent played the game play part of their lore yet.)

But platypus are ancient mammals, like what mammals use to be way back when, before we evolved to what we are now. They are OG Mammals. 

So maybe sniffers are just their own breed of ancient mammals. it fits."
1,17:53 that was still so smooth it would’ve been the best tag ever
0,YOU GOT HIM GEMMM
0,Take off armor. Equip tag. Drink invisibility potion. Stand where the tag will show.
1,"as a ""technically zoomer but not really"" but defo younger than you, you're hurting my feelings by not knowing who clippy is ;_;"
2,i had a dream where you posted and i woke up and there was actually a new video
1,"0:57 I didn't notice that you had the wrong skin on, but it just felt weird and I couldn't figure out why until you mentioned your skin"
1,im proud of you gem
2,You did an amazing job with the terrain! I feel like I've learned a lot seeing you learn to do terrain this season.
0,"The way I yelled Clippy would’ve gotten me put in a nice, white, padded room had I been in public 😂"
1,I am proud of you!
1,Gem I knew about clippy and I’m younger than you this is just sad
1,You just tag tango tek by 37:22
3,"Fun fact : Sniffers could very well be mammals. They may oviporous animals, but platipuses also are oviporous and they are mammals."
0,You Got Tango Gem !
0,3:22 You definitely were thinking Steve from Blue's Clues
0,Proud of you Gem!! 🥰
0,Wait the shrubbery is so pretty
0,Sniffers could be monotremes or saurians
1,clippy may have been introduced in 97 but it was around all through the 00s for sure. i'm only a year older than you and i definitely remember clippy from my childhood with windows xp
185,"I just checked Tangos vad, you did it gem. 37:21 id the time it showed up."
1,Is may sound surprising but I think sniff is there actually bugs because they have six legs and lay eggs
0,😊  Some mammals (at least one) do lay eggs.
2,12:04 Gem we are proud of anything you do! But you don't need our validation if you are proud of yourself that's what matters ♥
0,"you got so much done in this episode ! :D this is so great :DD
honestly i wouldn’t mind if you bragged off or showcased your terraforming a lot more, cuz we only see your end product between you and tango’s base somewhat minimally after you finished it"
0,"It would be cool if the sniffers could get worked into the lore, like it was multiple compounding factors that turns the village weird. Maybe they could be a platypus variant that does both eggs and milk and the villagers eating them is another driving force along with the scientist?"
1,Love ur vids so much❤❤❤❤
0,"😭😭😭 
I was born in 2007 and I am very familiar with the OG, Clippy, maybe that's just because we were poor 💀"
0,I'm younger than Gem (not by much) & I know Clippy
11,"Apparently, clippy was removed from Microsoft Office in 2007! I was wondering why I remembered clippy, even though I was born in 97 myself"
6,"I was born in 1997 so a year younger than Gem and I know who Clippy is he's an Internet and Pop Culture Icon but in Gems defense I probably know it from Movies around that time or something and Gem doesn't watch movies so maybe that's it

Also the teraforming looks amazing, I really need to work more on the teraforming around my own base especially now with Vanilla Shaders being on out on Bedrock I can play with that more, I've been revamping the lush cave my base is in with mushrooms and things"
0,cheers gem you now have made me feel old by you not knowing clippy 😭
0,i know clippy from Alan Beckers Stick Figure Animations
0,Where is the One Block series part 4??
0,"Okay, the Clippy thing was very mean to Grian"
0,"Gem not knowing Clippy isn’t an age thing, it’s just a Gem isn’t observant to the outside world at times"
1,The best part of tag is it’s forcing people to make videos now
247,"""Please be proud of me. Please."" 
Yes gem we are all very proud of you"
3,"I'm a year younger than you Gem, and I remember Clippy well. (It was in MS office until like 2007 which it was disabled by default at that point; and I went out of my way to turn it on.)"
2,OMG the pumpkin patch finally jump scared me!
0,It would be pretty cool if you connected the power lines to Tango's factory somehow. Give it a bit of purpose & lore behind it. Or creating some kind of power supply factory within your scientific experiments building...not sure what it's called at the moment
0,that sniffer has gotta be from osha
2,I thought it looked like doras map in grians video and was sooo confused of who two were thinking of 😂
0,"I was born in 1997, and I know who Clippy is."
0,"YES! Now that I'm all caught up on episodes after discovering Gem, I feel like I've been waiting for ages lol"
0,"A day is alwaysa  good day with a Gem video!! Love the terraforming, it's really coming together"
0,"Just watched the part of Tago’s stream where you tried to tag him. Sorry to say, but the tag cannot be seen from his POV. I’m gonna have to call that an unsuccessful tag. Sorry Gem 😢"
0,12:05 I’m very proud of you 😊
0,"Gem I know you get a billion comments, but just in case you scan over this, what do you think about adding a Scratching Post for the sniffers?  Kthx!"
0,"I don't think Clippy was still around when I used microsoft, but he's iconic!"
0,"That hat needs to be on a shelf facing Skizz's base, just so he has to see it."
0,did tango really got tagged? i feel like he was too far still for the tag to be clearly seen
0,Clippy is 90's babies AI :D
3,Tag rules were updated so now chat can’t be the ones to notify the streamer. If chat is the one that got them to notice it is a valid tag
0,OH MY GOODNESS IT DOES LOOK LIKE DORA'S MAP
0,clippy was like the first ever meme
0,3:20 reminds me of the leapfrog numbers and letters
0,Wow I am old...I graduated high school in 97...
0,Reminds me of the DNA character from Jurassic Park
5,16:43 Did anybody else notice the flying tree in the background? :o
462,Invisible scar wearing his own head is so cursed😂
1,Guardians kill squids and axolotls. So you might indeed want to put only fish with the guardians...
1,From the very very early episodes u wanted the red stone thing to glow when u touched it so i suggest deepslate.. well redstone!!
0,"Gem, basically: Please clap.
me: 👏👏👏"
0,"The implication that sniffers lay eggs because they're not mammals make me reconsider the classification of chickens, who can produce both eggs and live birth"
0,I have to side with Grian on the clippy thing... it's WILD that you didn't know you clippy was
0,DID IT APPEAR IN HIS VOD IF HE POSTED IT YET?
2,26:26 chickens aren't mammals and chickens don't lay eggs when breeding
1,YOUR 29 YEARS OLD?!?! I thought you were like 20 or something!....
0,I refuse to believe you do not know who Clippy is.
0,Yessss
3,"I'd rather not question Gem's imagination when it comes to childhood memories.
3:54 Okay, so Grian's the older sibling. =P
4:42 The family's fighting again.
Also she's three years older than me apparently. =P"
0,oh i want sniffers so bad they are so cute
1,"21:46 What I heard, ""It's good for them. _Vitamin Gravity""_"
1,1:15 I may be overthinking or maybe I missed something but what is that archway?
0,I was born in 97 and I knew who Clippy was
0,Congratulations on 2m
0,Engagement!
0,Hangi takım olursa benim için farketmez. 👍
0,"Dogimiss, futbol kariyerinden sonra şimdi de basketbolda mı 1 numara olacak. 😂😂😂"
0,No way you only did 35 episodes!! That’s actually crazy
0,Never felt more old than when Gem yelled “97!!”
0,"Guardians kill Squid
Axolotol kill ALL Fish"
0,"I believe I am the same age as Gem (born in '96), but I know Clippy. We are good friends"
0,I was 3 and I know clippy!! I’m pretty sure he was around when I started college or maybe till my Highschool years? 😂
0,"I just got a thought : instead of putting custom hat textures on Pumpkins (which break when you place them down, and hinder vision), why not use leather or iron helmets instead ?"
0,Proud of u gem!!!!! 12:09
0,"Congrats, you were successful with the Tag :)"
0,The terrain looks amazing!
0,"chat snitches, why are we like this chat?"
0,HI GEM.
16,"I love the timelapses, but I also love that you included clips of individual block breaking. Makes it feel more realistic and inspires me to do terrain too!"
0,Gem ~never~ gets distracted
0,This season's theme is procrastination
0,"You guys saw the tag and thought of dora and clippy.

I saw the tag and saw Rick's best friend from rick and morty. I think it was a pencil. Haven't watched in a few years, so I forgot his name."
5,"In Tango’s epic tennis VOD at 34:56 is when Gem tries to tag him. But you can’t see because of how he flies in and the use of hitboxes 😢 then chat ruins it😠🙄. Awesome try though, Gem!"
159,"26:00
Sniffers would still be considered mammals.
they seem to be warm blooded, which negates reptiles.
they have fur which throws amphibian out the window
and they don't have wings which means they definitely aren't avian.
but we know it's possible for mammals to lay eggs, platypuses, and echidnas are some of the only species on earth that lay eggs instead of giving live birth."
0,gemgem
1,I'm only a few years away from Gem's age and I know the Word paperclip guy lol hahah
0,"To please you, as you predicted when talking to skizz the other day I will leave a small comment about how server updated and you don't have a single clip od the happy ghast ;)"
1,What if sniffers are in fact mammals that just lay eggs like platypus?
1,Gem could you have been thinking about Handy Manny when you said the guy with the green shirt? He had a toolbox of tools that sort of resemble the tag 😁
0,Wasn't you born in 1996? Bc I'm 4 days older than you I think and I know Clippy 😂
0,"I was in high school when you were one, so I definitely know Clippy."
259,"Gem: ""I'm going to match [Pearl's] energy.""
_Me having just come from a stream where Pearl was playing a videogame as a squirrel with the zoomies_

(and yes, I get she meant specifically about the terrain, and I think she succeeded)"
0,"around 26:35 - 26:37, did anyone hear female like voice... im quite sure it wasn't game sound nor gem voice..."
0,"Your tag on false should have counted because false failed to point out the tag or when you were holding it. She called you out based off suspicion, which shouldn't count because it means that paranoia is a good enough reason to make a tag invalid."
538,"26:18 Mammal is not out of the question. Prehistoric mammals - just like the modern platypus - did lay eggs. The question is, do they nurse their young?"
0,That was one of the most enjoyable episodes of the season! Cant wait to see the terraforming finished and maybe a couple extra small houses and trees around the edges of the base😁😁
0,Hiiiii love your vids❤
11,i love how connected the server is this season.. its like big boatem :D
0,"Gem sees a clippy look a like and goes right to Blue's clues, lol"
3,TBF the last time Clippy was in any MS Word software was in 2007.
0,"I'm not even from the generation, and I knew what he was Referencing."
0,lil tree
5,"I agree with Grian, I also can't believe you don't know Clippy... now I feel very old..."
0,"Maybe you and Scar Mandela effected Guardians targeting fish?  They only ever target players, Squid, Glow Squid and Axolotl's"
5,JUSTICE FOR CLIPPY!
0,summer started and ive been bored for an hour tysm!!
87,"About thinking that Guardians kill fish, we were talking about it on Scar's stream and our best guess is that because Guardians drop cod when they die, you guys might have assumed those cod were coming from fish they killed."
1,12:03 Proud of you gem. :)
28,"absolutely love terraining in Minecraft. So underrated. Especially the ""inbetweens"". Connecting bases through paths and terraforming is.. *chefs kiss*"
195,"sibling energy with Grian and the slapping, though when my brother and i fight in minecraft it always goes from slapping to swords and death loops. i love the terrain! it's so good and has given me ideas."
3,"The sniffer crack me up, they have so much personality"
0,"I took a Quick Look at Tango’s Vod and I don’t think the tag was really discernible, sorry to say"
0,"Gem, are you gonna do another hardcore series soon?"
0,Gem... Even i know who clippy is (im 16)
0,"I watched Tangos stream after this and couldn't see the tag 🫤 But I watch at mobile, so maybe there is hope"
0,GEMMMM IVE MISSED YOU
4,I honestly don't remember if Guardian's ever attacked fish but I feel like it would be a massive lag issue so they might have gotten rid of it?
1,Watching new squid games but gem is more important
0,"Lol, I am from 98 and I know clippy, and have even used it"
0,sadly no tag. i watched tango's vod and I could barely see you or the tag in your hand
0,ooo I built walls just like the retaining walls in my friends realm
0,I love terraforming
0,Honestly I think sniffers are probably monotremes like echidnas and platypuses
1,Being about Grian's age....I understand the pain. 😂
0,under an hour :D
55,2:12 Okay I was looking at the beautiful terrain here and I have an idea for you gem… a small cave that maybe breaks into your lab and the people who took over the castle are studying some sort of nest within the cave? Just an idea for *LORE* purposes hehe-
0,oh wow im early
0,We’re proud gem
0,OMG I was thinking of Dora's map too when I first saw the Tag!! Glad to know it wasn't just me!
1,Gem is great
0,"You should add some sort of green house at the end of the fortress, maybe the scientist is testing the water with different plants, to see how they mutate"
1,YESSS I NEEDED THIS GEM VID
0,I’m older than the both of you!!!
1,Coming home from sports day to a geminitay video? AMAZING! :D
0,NEW GEMINITAY VID
0,needed a video from gem badly😭 so happy this came on my fyp😭😭
17,4:48 not putting a picture of clippy in your video is a crime 😂
2,"I wasn't even alive last century, and even I know who Clippy is!"
0,26 mins since posted
0,Loved this episode!
0,I mean tbf dude I've heard of clippy and I'm younger than you
3,This is such a reward because earlier i had a report at school that i absolutely got scared with. But this episode just uploaded rn and it's genuinely feels like an award :)) Thank you Gem!
3,I saw clippy the moment grian showed the tag. I feel old.
0,I would say that sniffers are egg-laying mammals like platypuses
1229,"I think it be really cool if you and tango had a power line that goes from the factory into the lab. Kinda like the scientist needed power, so she decided to just steal from the near by factory, or stroke a deal with them."
91,"4:02 the thing is i feel kinda old knowing who clippy is and having been able to interacted with clippy as a child, despite being 23 years old😂😂😂"
1300,3:20 YOUR THINKING OF BLUE'S CLUES. The guy with the Green Shirt and crayon is named Steve! Not to be confused with MineCraft Steve. (There was other hosts too but Steve is the iconic one).
0,Yippee I am early ^_^
0,Gem i’ve heard you mention dredge multiple times in other videos and then recently i saw it recommended to me. I started playing and now i can’t stop 😔
251,Idk if anyone has ever seen Handy Mandy as a kid (the old one not the newer one) but the Tag thing looks like one of his tools
1,Do you think that she should make an animal crossing video everyone😅
1,congrats on 2mil gem <3
0,i used to ask clippy why my family hated me.... he never had an answer 😂 I know this is very sad but I'm 30 now I'm mostly over it
0,it's not new but i genuinely love the animal crossing music in the background 😙
1,It feels so illegal to be this early
2,"Gem, you should make an animal crossing video"
1,8:22 describes my life perfectly
370,I love how every season since Grain joined has had a game of tag. It's so fun to see more server wide projects later in the season!
0,8:22 I will be a shame
0,I have never heard of clippy either.
1,A great day when gem gives us a video!
1,Wrong skin on in the start? Maybe because they were filming the life series???????

0,Hi Gem!
10,"How am I this early?! 
Gem, it's been such a joy following your videos these last 5 years. They provide a peaceful break from normal life, and it's so cool watching you unleash your art & creativity. It's inspiring for me in my own worlds. And BDubs was right in Wild Life- you have an aura of calm that spreads to others, it makes these so relaxing. So excited to see the base progress!"

0,Hey Gem!
0,First
14,Three views is crazy
9,AHHH YESS HERMITCRAFT
0,Hi gem
1,FIRST MOLTEN MAMAS
0,4:35... I just... I ... amogus
0,Jesus saves pride doesn’t
1,I think Gem has the most unique and creative hiding spots in the series. She’s always innovating
0,This was cute!!
0,Jimmy - how are you so good at building gahh
0,6:26: I see mogswamp’s build in the background 😂
0,I'm curious how long it'd take for them if gem didn't give any hints
0,The giggles are so cute😂❤
0,Why am i like this 😂❤ i love her shes goood great builder im definitely subbing ❤
0,6:30 i love how you can see mogswamps candy cane sawmill in the background lol
0,42:05 gem jumpscare
0,An insanely good build ❤
0,You can see one of mog’s builds in the background 6:18
0,It would be funny to have a room full of Gem decoys and the you hide among them😂
0,"You should do a mini version of build and seek! There is a way to shrink in vanilla Minecraft, but then you can make hallways out of stairs blocks, hide under beds etc etc"
0,do you have a download for this build?
0,Scott’s reactions are great 😂
0,That crane was somewhere in Russia I think. This is only based off my minimal geoguessr knowledge about the sign with the three striped crosswalk though. Sorry if i am incorrect
0,gem is so thoughtful for dropping the clues! also I love the silly hiding spots she made
1,A cool trick I learned was if you use a trapdoor or a slab behind a painting you can only get through crouching (Srry for bad spelling)
0,Gems city has a lot of hidden gems
1,you guys should do a build and seek with people from the community like a team build and seek Battle you know
0,I love ur videos
0,One could argue that the painting hiding place requires parkour
0,different hiding spots and different times the hints were given
0,jimmy's wicked reference...
0,Gem I love your videos
1,Gem should let jojo do the parkour to the roof when she first hid up she gave her too many hints and fir others too
0,"interesting to me that all of your city refs had brick building but you didn't choose brick for any of your buildings 
i personally do also like the vibe of brick buildings irl but do struggle with making them work in minecraft"
1,18:07 Happy pride Jojo and everyone reading this comment! <3 🏳‍🌈🏳‍⚧
0,"I don't know exactly where the crane picture is from, but the pedestrian crossing sign seems to be just like the ones in Ukraine but mirrored in the photo (while others have some differences)"
0,AYO SAN FRANCISCO MENTION
0,Could you please link the others' videos in your description? That would make it a little easier to find them :)
0,"4:18, never been to new york, let alone in the 1980s"
0,Lisa’s plus Reese’s puffs ended up eating up eat up eat it up
0,"22:38

Gem couldve won if it wasnt for the shoe"
0,Jojo almost immediately finding every other spot Gem hid in is wild
0,Take note.  Jojo was the longest but she found the earlier hiding spots fairly quickly.  Props for that!
0,I knew it would be a claw machine
0,"6:28 oh hey thats mogswamps very evil hidenseek map, i didnt know these were all in the same world! very cool"
0,Lol I really like it!
0,I don’t watch you often but this is such a amazing video I genuinely love it so much ❤ (ps I will watch more)
0,22:07 Bi shoelaces? (Im probably just crazy)
0,yayayay another build and seek!! i love these videos :)
0,Gem please come to Jesus
1,cool
1,Woow love the video.🎉
0,20:45 Scott literally sees you lol
0,Yes JoJo happy pride lol
0,@Geminitay I’m a huge fan Honestly I’m so enthralled by your build style I’ve been trying to recreate it but I’m not having much success I don’t wanna outright copy I’m still looking for my own style but watching you has inspired me to try harder I may be in my 30s but it’s just so magical ❤🎉😊
1,"I like it how Jimmy, who kept being called a toy in the last Empires, with lots of Toy Story jokes, is now making his own TS references with this challenge's build.

(14:03 - context) 19:43 Suddenly Scott ; 20:28
21:59 uh-oh, a shoe has been spotted xD
24:24 Shelby checking ALL the paintings??
24:42, 25:05
25:38 cupcakes
25:49 Shelby sees new blocks, Gem makes a peep
27:00 Shelby will need her head later, for reasons
27:16 Gem sees Shelby
27:31 Shelby sees Gem
30:38 Jimmy finds himself
37:14 the wall says hello back xD
38:18, 38:40 cool windows
38:43 redstone talk"
1,"Gem and mogswamp need to be in the same video, they both make insanely hard hiding spots with a lot of tricks"
2,22:08 Its like a cat hiding under a blanket with its tail poking out!
0,"This is only the second build and seek video I've watched. However, both builds started with ""everyone else has started, but I haven't.""

It was Grian btw"
1,You should've used orange trapdoors so they match with your hair
1,"After watching all the videos, there is a clear theme of “Scott is going to find me so I need to hide somewhere that’s good”"
1,Gem felt like a nicer version of mob and if you don’t know why he made a sewer with a leaver you have you find to get into then a hitten button that if you hit and run fast enough you can get into a glass maze then in a 9 layer black maze to get to the spot.😂
0,also such a cool build... it rlly does feel like ny
0,SHUBBLE NJ MENTIONNN jersey pride..
0,GEM HAPPY 2 MILLION SUBS!!!!
0,this is such a great build its so beautiful and fun to run around and find things in
0,"i love these,     how much time do they get to build their plots?"
0,"Congrats on 2 mil gem, totally deserved!"
0,I dont think we see Mog ever again in build and seek😢
0,Gem these hiding spots are absoutely diabolical!! I cant believe this was for a build and seek build! It would look great in hermitcraft
0,i love seeing jojo interact with you i hope she’s in more of these videos!
0,The crane picture is from Sweden!!1 <3
0,WOOO CONGRATS ON 2M!
0,That tunnel was just devious
0,I think Scott would've found you in 30sec but they thought the iron was parcour
0,I thought you snuck an among us character into that building in the front lol
0,"Dude youre so underrated!! I love your personality, and you arent too energetic, but not to boring. Thank you for always making my day!"
0,Mind the Gem ❤
0,Gem is the cute hermit gem is best girl gem is great gem gem
1,Your city looked amazing
0,Congratz for 2mils!
1,i love geminitay ❤️
1,23:21 “just hide n seek in a big city” if anyone wants to watch irl Jet Lagged the game has done hide n seek across Japan and other countries/cites. Tbf id be interested in a cross over with mc YouTubers and the people from Jet Lagged
0,Hashtag pride killed me
0,Jimmy is not beating the toy allegations after his build.
0,"nah I think shubble had it handed out to her lol, scott really had to go through it all."
0,"33:34 gem asking, “have you seen my underground?”"
0,"9:35 JIMMY, TAKE NOTES!😂"
0,Jimmy builds a claw machine and still wants to convince people he’s not a toy.🤣
0,Is there a world download?
1,32:33 Jimmy looking for Gem in a chest
0,Hi Gemmm!! I’ve just noticed congrats on 2 mil!! You deserve it!! ❤️
1,Love your videos gem! Your my favourite youtuber! ❤
0,31:36 he sounds like a lost child looking for his mom
0,that tunnel hiding spot was amazing
0,a painting than a painting on the paintingwhich you hide between in
0,THE BLACK CONCRETE TUNNEK WAS GOOD
0,This is my favourite series and I always love your builds <3
0,Gem are you secretly sponsored by Pintrest
0,"""One of my favorite cities was San Fransisco""

Was the last time you went 10+ years ago?"
0,Cool
0,i love how she said there’s no parkour but lowkey the spot where she hid for shelby required some parkour to find
1,Idk if you’ll see this but I think a fun idea could be if you got like 6 people on and did teams of two with more room. I don’t know how the seeking would work but I think it could be fun. Have like one person roll the prompt and one person roll a theme to get some funny/ interesting outcomes.
1,I'm too competitive for this XD. Watching them talk and give away there spot is starting to make my eye twitch XD
0,I think gem has done to much guess the building
5,"i love that along with the block placing sounds at 3:20, you can kinda hear Gem’s mouse clicking 😊"
0,ooohhh this is such a fun concept!
0,I love your vids
3,"i love how everything in the build is intentional and has a purpose outside of just being hiding places and how you like ""build"" a whole world with these, like the way you plan out these hide and seek builds is so fascinating to watch!!"
1,"I just wanted to say I love the style you do these videos in, giving each seeker a separate time in the spotlight; it lets the viewer get invested in each of them. 

The was awesome. Making such a small plot feel so huge and city-like. Well done"
1,👸🏙OMG! Gem is the master of build and seek builds! Is there a way to get these builds for download? I want them so bad!
0,"YAY!!!!
More build and seek!!!!"
0,We need more of these
0,A sculk sensor and note block with custom noise would have been so cruel in this to mislead someone as being closer than expected.
0,it's wild that you could literally see gem as scott fell off the building lmao
0,2 milllyyÿyy
0,To balance out the crane I think you could have maybe added a water tower on one of the buildings like in New York especially considering that the plot was heavily influenced by the New York esthétique
0,happy 2 million subs gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,I'd love a round where everyone gets to hide in each hiding map. 3 hiders one seeker. The fun of everyone who hasn't seen the map try to find a hiding spot.
0,"Yesss, I love these videos :D"
0,Love these videos!
0,You should do escape rooms next!
0,"That subway hiding spot is so hard to see, I’d remember that for the next build."
0,:3
0,YASSS SAN FRANCISCO!!
0,congrats on 2 mil gem!! : D
0,"Gem, you did so awesome with this! You picked the best hiding spot for each person, and made great decoys that distracted people - fakeout painting nooks, redstone levers that didn't help everyone, armor stand fakes, and even a sign at a dead end can cost people a few seconds because with a lot of people, your brain tends to automatically read stuff like that, in case it's a hint. Also, even though you said you don't have much experience building cities, this actually looks comparable to what Bdubs has going on in Impulse's base right now 👍❤ Very impressive, gg!"
0,"I love the little city, this has to be one of my favorite Gem builds so far! Build and Seek is a great way to explore it."
0,This build is very bdubs
5,"Something devious that you could do is instead of levers, use trapped chests or lecturns because they never usually open the stuff. They just look at it and leave."
0,That tunnel was absolutely devious
0,Beautiful city build!!!
0,"Very entertaining! 
Suggestion: freecam for hider?"
0,"Jimmy is the only non lgbtqia+ player🤣 idk why that’s funny to me, but it is😂"
0,great video gem the city looked so amazing
0,If Gem did say anything she would've won almost every round.
0,That fake void spot in the underground is so good. I don’t think any of them would’ve found it naturally
0,i wish i could build that well :D
0,Why are there so many painting items in Gem's buildings? Are they popping off of the walls or something?
0,gem didn't tell her theme because of guess the build where they keep their theme's a secret lol
0,Someone should put Jim Jim in the claw machine because he’s a toy lol 🤠
0,"i was just thinking about how rare it is for people to use redstone in these, build and seek videos. what if smajor invited mumbo to one of these?"
0,"Gem: builds a city in less than a year.

Impulse: How you do that??"
0,would love to see you do a city like this in a future hermitcraft season
0,I'm curious why everyone ends up with a bunch of paintings in their inventory?
0,"another master piece Gem, love your buildings"
1,GIGGS should do this with “Guess the Build”
0,"It would be even more sneaky to have iron trapdoors or piston doors triggered by observers watching things like note blocks, barrels, decorative trapdoors, or even redstone ore under carpet! Or a button or lever up high on an exterior wall which is hard to reach."
0,"6:21 I believe that’s Paris!
(also i love the build its so pretty and compact!!)"
4,It's awesome to see Jojo and Shubble in videos.
0,Who’s that guy in the red shirt
0,"""i like san francisco and london, so i built new york"""
0,I couldn't wait for more episodes of this series! Your builds are amazing! You're all so talented! ❤❤❤
0,6:48 the building on the front looks like amogus
0,"Painting trick improvement: You can use a slab to obstruct the player when jumping through normally. They would have to sneak while jumping to get through.

Also when usind trapdoors, you could add a delay and close the trapdoor again, so that it doesn't stay open."
0,Congrats on 2M subscribers Gem!! ❤
1,Congratulations on 2 million gem🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0,I'm pretty sure Taylor Swift has songs based on Gem's build monologues.
0,6:22 can't believe they made construction site from every single post-soviet city into a good reference picture
0,No one check the dark part of the subway
0,I loved jimmys laugh at 32:23 “heheheOUHHHHHhehehehhehe”
0,Gem was so nice with her hints
0,"Hello! You guys are great and im obsessed with all your content Gem! 🎉 (specially vintage story)
I wonder if you guys ever did, but it would be fun to have your pov as a seeker in all the buildings! Even cooler if it was a stream with help from the chat and bring us on to an even more immersive experience :) 
Have a good one!"
0,24:03 Gem looking through the window 🤣🤣
0,"31:07 Is that Jimmy making a Wicked reference, didn't expect that on my bingo card"
0,hey Gem did you know gingers are now considered black
0,Does gem have bi socks? They look like the right colours
0,"Dang, that sudden ""Mind the Gap"" reminded me of Fallout London"
0,Gem remaking the mogswamp incident was not on my bingo card🥀💔
0,"That subway tunnel was the best hiding spot, honestly.  As a New Yorker, I approve! 😁👍🏼

Loved the decoy Gem's, btw. ❤"
0,This has been the best edition of hide and seek yet! Everyone brought their A game 😎
0,Ok but y she cute though

1,I love that Jojo is now in these kinda videos
0,❤
0,A day with a gem upload is a good day😌 Hope you're having a great pride month
0,I can physically feel Grian's eye twitching from halfway around the world as he watches this
0,Gem how do you have the time for this with your other series going on???
0,This video inspired me to stay up till 4 am with my younger siblings and cousin doing our own build and seek. Thank you
0,I wonder how long Scott would take had he not seen Gem’s shoe
2,Gem and Scott juet built Joels HC base hahahaha
0,Sf also has an underground its mainly muni but Bart also goes under the city. Plus they both intercept every so often
0,SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED IM FROM SAN FRANCISCO I LOVE SAN FRANCISCO
0,My chila 🫴😀
0,I love the fact that Shelby and Jim swapped to fit their styles more but i was really hoping to see a circus jimmy build...
0,"Girls, Gays, Jimmy, order we love to see"
0,Where one block?
0,"The build is already amazing, but the food should've been in a hot dog cart 😅"
0,❤❤❤
0,Gem's City build is absolutely amazing!! I could definitely see gem doing a full city for season 11 or 12! Amazing video.
0,Gem is great
0,Gem hit 2m subscribers :((((( i'm so proud
0,10:46 she skinned Steve and has a Steve rug 😱

0,the creative menu has specific paintings and their sized now
0,I love that this group is the girls the gays and theres just Jimmy
23,"I love how each person found the unused hiding spots super easily, but had a tough time with the ones you chose for them. I think you might be good at getting into their seeker mindsets. And that's *_really_* saying something for Scott!"
0,"Oooh, one of my favorite series 😁"
0,"great video, compact build. like that"
0,i love this series so much its so addicting 🤩
0,14:46 gemmmUUGHHHH  LOL

0,congrats on 2 mil Gem!!
1,"""added in a rainbow"" maybe also a sledge hammer to represent beating nuance to a pulp
maybe a little cynical but I'm just keepin it real"
2,"I was so surprised to hear jojo. I watched her play SG when she had 1k subs, so happy for her success."
36,"Jojo:”Hello?”
Random sign:”hi” 😂😂"
0,"Oh heck yes, another Build and Seek with Gem's awesome skills! <3"
1,Hiya Gem! Hide and Seek City was awesome!!! Who likes you likes comments to you. Thank you for the video! Gem is Great!!! <3 ~respect
1,"Based off the thumbnail, I actually wondered if the theme was “bdubs”. Take that how you will, but it’s definitely meant as a compliment"
1,"gem: 'they always try and jump through painting' 
gem 2 minutes later: 'i don't think they're gonna expect to jump through a painting'"
1,This was such a cool build! 🏙️
1,This was a fantastic Build! loved this
1,Hear me out....... hide and seek with the Create mod :D
1,"Gem: ""No parkour""
Also Gem: *immediately hides in the 1 spot that actually needed a lil bit of parkour*
😹🤦🏽‍♀️"
1,Im sooo happy this series is back. 🥰🥰
1,ooo these are also fun to see! some people really go all out to mess with their friends
1,i reallly want to know how long it took her to do this
4,I kind of hope Gem does a city themed base in the next HC season. She absolutely nailed it this time.
0,That crane looks oddly similar to grian’s cranes???
1,Your builds are always so awesome keep up the amazing work
1,congrats on 2mill Gem!
1,I love the childlike energy gem brings to this!
1,"I was in San Francisco today, when you pulled city it was my first thought!! Heck yeah"
1,Neat trick you can do with paintings is ha e them occupy the same block as vines to make climbable paintings.
1,Pretty Awesome All Around!!!!
1,Jimmy’s building skills are getting a lot better
1,JIMMY KILLED IT
2,I love how Jimmy’s claw machine and JoJo’s rainbow are like connected 💕
1,😊
2,ha! not a single person looked in the train tunnel hiding spot! and only Jojo with help
2,"3 lgbt and jimmy, my favourite combo"
1,"If you ever go to Portland, the Portland underground is pretty cool"
1,What happened to the one block series? Is it on pause?
4,omg i was just rewatching the old ones! today was a good day and this video is the cherry on top :)
1,"In relation to mystery city at 6:20 , I immediately thought it was familiar as being Melbourne, because there are lots of colourful skyscrapers there (even famous green ones) and there always seems to be cranes around. I was wondering if anyone also might think it’s Melbourne or if someone recognises or knows it to be somewhere else. I’m curious…

Update: The sign is a Ukrainian pedestrian crossing sign, I can’t find what city in Ukraine it is though. I was very wrong thinking it was Melbourne…

Update 2: Looking at Ukraine skylines, my best guess is Kyiv, the capital city, as I found photos with a similar looking building as the picture Gem used, even with a crane near it."
1,"Thx for the diversion from
No Kingsland
🍻"
1,"Gem you should definitely use axiom it's so helpful yet easy to learn, pls help yourself 🙏"
1,Always love the build and seek videos! Could be fun if whenever you get to do another if the seeker gets to choose the next hiding spot might make them more into looking around to find where to tell you to hide
9,FINALLY! Someone got Scott with his own game! Armor stands for the win!
2,Really enjoyed it!❤
1,lovely city!
1,You were the first minecraft Youtuber I ever  watched. ( also I typed this with my nose)😂
2,Minecraft build and seek: pride edition (ft Jimmy)
1,"At 3:18 ""Oh cool just a simple rectangle skyscraper, LOOK BACK at  3:31 ""OH WOW"" Felt like one of those art tutorials where they cut and it went from a stick doodle to a masterpiece XD"
1,I love the subtle keyboard sounds 👌
1,OMG YESSS IVE MISSED BUILD AND SEEK SO MUCH!!!!!!
1,"I love this more than guess the build tbh, thanks for making them"
1,omg this build has given me so much inspiration for my own world <3
1,"If this is a actual schematic I would download this and put it as my own, it's so good"
3,20:53 Scott’s so concerned about his psychopathic friend 😂
1,2 million congrats gem
1,if yall ever play the creat mod ...you could build some incredible things with your talents ...like the carasel moving
2,Only Gem would build an entire Crane just for decoration. I have no idea why I am surprised that she didn’t have a hiding spot there.
7,"W Jojo, her building has only improved ten scale since teaming with Hermits"
1,I wish you didn't give them clues! Great video 100% tho! Let them try and figure things out.
1,7:39 cause you're a Gemini 😂
25,Just realising how perfect Jojo would be for Hermitcraft and now I need this to happen
2,The black tunnel is crazy hard because you can't see it at all. Nice spot.
1,HAPPY 2M SUBSCRIBERS AND PRIDE MONTH 🎉🎉🎉
1,I would actually love to live in this city 🌆
3,18:05 pride and seek lol
1,🦆
1,By far the best.
1,Who would win at arm wrestling: Shub or Gem?
270,"The void tunnel in the underground is diabolical (in a cool building trick way). I would not have thought to press against the black concrete to check for an entrance, especially with that lever down there next to the track. On that note, Gem and Grian really do share a braincell with Grian adoring the white void room and Gem constructing a black void tunnel"
1,"Hii Gem!
I love your videos✨
I’m curious, what are the dimensions of the plots that you guys are working with?"
1,"For such a limited plot to build on, that was a really great build!"
1,That was so much fun!! Your build was incredible
1,As soon as you got City I was so excited for an underground portion!
2,"The reference image with the crane and green building looks like it could be Russia! The architecture makes sense, and the road sign in the foreground has 3 lines on it (one of the Geoguessr tricks I remember 😅). Probably Moscow or Petersburg!"
1,6:20 this looks like an apartment complex somewhere in Moscow suburbs (or similar) :3
1,I love this series
1,‘Thank you for watching me torture my friends’ is so Gem
1,IT'S BAAAAAAAAACK
1,"How kind of you to shower your friends with hints of where to find you! If I were you, I'd stay silent all the way throughout the round and listen to them slowly losing their sanity."
3,This is just a full on hermitcraft build
0,"Hi Gem, on you’re streams you’ve been wondering if your new keyboard is too loud, as someone with misophonia it was definitely too loud for me I’d appreciate it is you switched back"
0,"I'm so glad build and seek is back! I think you did an awesome job with your theme, your city is awesome. Some sneaky spots in there too. You are so good at hide and seek."
0,can you tag or link the others so I can easily click through to their videos on mobile?
619,"I do find it really funny because you thought the Subway one was going to be the easiest, but NO ONE found it, and Jojo literally found Shelby and Jimmy's spots SO QUICKLY."
4,This was a fun watch! Really great build and hiding spots. 😊
2563,that black concrete tunnel was a crazy strong spot. i think no-one would have ever checked it in the 10 minutes without a hint.
88,this was so much fun :D
0,You should do something nice since your channel had two minutes subscribers 20 mil
18,"So, when is Gem adding one of these buildings to Impluse & BDubs city on Hermitcraft? It would fit right in. (Wonderful video Gem!)"
3,You could do one with carpet and scaffolding below it so you crouch any go through it
0,Why was Jimmy the only one on the Thumbnail? Ew
2,"Gem did you get a new keyboard? I can hear it, but it sounds really nice. Like the ASMR keyboard videos. The suppressed clicks are really good."
1,I’ve been watching old content and I am so messed up realizing Shelby was part of skydoesminecrafts crew
1,So much fun! thank you Gem
1,5:27 turn your speaker up to full volume and let that gorgeus sound sink in
1,Thanks for Sharing 👍👍✌
2,Jimmy's not beating these toy allegations is he?
1,the Hitchcock of it all...
2,lol poor jojo
557,"32:23 Jim: ""I can smell you""

the dynamic between you two is so good it can't be written."
0,5:54 very sus.
1,hey happy 2 million
2,Great hiding spots. So creative. Loved the design of the metro station
1,YOOOO MORE BUILD AND SEEK!!!
2,"gem’s hide and seek builds are the best, many different spots always trips people up"
208,With how your minimal red stone affected people I now want to see what a redstoner like mumbo or tango would do.
0,Anyone know what texture packs Shubble was using?
3,"Build & Seek is one of my favorite Minecraft series' (probably only behind the Life series), so it's always a good day when I see you've made another video of it."
239,"Gem knows her friends so well, she pics the perfect spot for each person like every time .
10/10 calls Gem!"
0,The hints are way to early ...
9,i really thought the wall subway spot was kinda obvious but literally nobody went to that one and no one found that like neither Scott or jimmy and Shuble would probs find that... crazyyy really didn't expect that. Btw Gorgeous build gem knocked it out the park ones more.
126,"20:43 the fact that we can see gem but poor Scott didn't realise, lol"
1,Gem will never not be my comfort content creator 🫶🥰
13,"Tip for the painting spots, they are a lot harder to get into if you use trapdoors, one on either side of a 1x2 hole."
6,"If i were to play this, i'd basically build the Kowloon walled city every time. That, or recently having been ""infected"" with Stray (one of the most beautiful game this side of 2009) knowledge, the Bunker city (and throw a lot of cats in). The size of the lot instantly sends me to that city. I guess that's what architecture mind does to you sometimes. You create, but sometimes ""it"" creates for you. It, being the space your work occupies."
1,I love these videos sm
1,This was so fun to watch!! Loved all the trick levers! The city build is so cool and I loved the void-like effect of the train station!
0,fun!
1,"Congrats on 2 million Gem, we love you!! ❤"
2,Congrats for 2 million❤🎉
2,Who thinks the middle building looks like the among us characters.😂
9,"If you had a trap door, that put you into crawl mode, and then you crawled to a painting spot, no one would ever find you if the painting and the trap door were not both visible at the same time."
3,JOJOOOO
2,Gem is great
1,The void spot is so evil

2145,Ngl the subway spot was evil and I can't believe Gem thought it was an easy spot. Idk if it was just youtube conpression but that hole was invisible.
28,2:15 yeah you’ve always been a town builder not a city architect. But you did an awesome job!

2,"Gem, that subway hiding spot is absolutely EVIL! Congrats on hitting 2 Million by the way!"
0,"So, What about bringing Mogswamp back to Hide and Build, lol"
3,I was literally JUST re-watching Build and Seek and then this masterpiece comes out! Glad it's back :)
1,Your city build was so good! You had so much detail and stuff going on for such a small space and really made it feel like a city
1230,21:05 - The irony of Scott calling Gem a psychopath when he subjected her to bamboo parkour XD
0,"Am I going crazy or did I hear the Life series teaser music???? 18:13
I might just be going crazy but it would be really funny if it was."

Also I've been watching your videos(for yrs but today..)for the last 4hrs and you give me SOOOO much inspiration to build. I need to sleep but all I want to do is hop on Minecraft lol. Not only that but before I watched you I watched mumbo and HIS HAIR IS GREY?!?!?!? Had to look that up, Google doesn't know(said it's to do with hermitcraft, I think it's his 10 yr anniversary or maybe that was last yr. Honestly dont know, ive been in a toxic relationship the last 2 yrs sooo) you mentioned mumbos weird way of using his keyboard and it sent me WAY back"

Fighting practice ring
Cave plant garden (glow berries and moss)

Chapel or other place of worship
Old mine exit with left over broken stuff

Ideas that are more modern:

Geothermal power plant
Water treatment plant
Underground research gardena
More tubes with larger specimen
Dissection tables
Just a creepily hollowed-out room"

Also would be cool to see a hermit shrink ray in the lab"

0,"I absolutely love what u did in the fortress, and I've had an idea for quite a while: on the left side of the fortress, you could do sort of a rocky marshland( inspired from midland marsh from miitopia) and a witch hut, adding some more lore to your base"
0,"Gem: Let's add some medieval elements to our castle.
Also Gem: build brutalist architecture that would be totally unthinkable in the middle ages.

Gem ... horizontal stone structures are really difficult to build. In the medieval times, humans mostly still built nothing but arches, walls, pillars and domes out of stone. For stone pillars you kind of need tensioned steel reinforced concrete. And that's not even period appropriate for brutalism.

(fun fact: one of the earliest bridges ever built with that building technique just collapsed in the city I live in. Thankfully only the city budget and the traffic were hurt.)"
4,Gemmmmmmmmm!!!! Please make jimmy so he's floating upside down in the test tube. It would be amazing

0,"for an old building, i imagine some of the floor being broken, and perhaps some plywood was put down to even out the broken flooring?"

0,"Hi Gem! The way Elder Guardians work is that they search for players within a 50-block spherical range, and then apply Mining Fatigue III once every minute; so it will definitely affect most if not all of your base, but it might not reach Skizz/Tango/Grian!"
0,"GEM GEM GEM listen to the song  Galway girl, its sung by MALINDA. it reminded me of you!"
0,"If you put a chain or lightning rod in the top of the tank and used a version of their skin with closed eyes, you could make it look like they're attached to some cables."
0,"Gem, any good scientist would keep a control sample, so maybe some smaller “control” aquariums make sense around the big one, too!"
1,"I do like what you've made. I think the issue I'm running into is you want this to be a reclaimed space and it doesn't feel like it yet. Places like these would be made with being a castle in mind - armor and weapon storage, kitchen, bed rooms, dungeon. Any scientist moving in would have to work with the preexisting layout to some extent. You can even have it where walls have been changed or added. With just the feast hall done, it doesn't have that reclaimed vibe yet. Hopefully when it gets closer to done, the narrative will be a bit clearer.
BDub's base from last season was like this too. It might be good to look back and take notes if you're having a hard time here.
Sorry if this comes off as annoying or anything. I know this will look really good when you're done with it. I really want to see how it turns out."
0,"18:46 TAGGED! 

Also, I love the interior Gem did. It’s really cool"

0,"GEM 2M !!🎉🎉🎉 
THE CROWD CHEERS!!!"
3,"Since i am not seeing many other comments saying this, i might as well.
The Mining Fatigue effect of the Elder Guardian is 50 blocks, almost 1/5 of that is already just inside the building. So, your neighbors will definitely not get the effects, so as long as you yourself don't mind the mining fatigue, you are good to place an Elder Guardian in the tank"
0,"It would be awesome for @@ThatMumboJumbo to build gem a 3x3 piston door in the ""passageway"" (20:24)"
0,"Not sure if this was planned but with the circle on the bottom floor of the lab I could almost envision the aquarium cylinder extending all the way down? Idk if that takes away from the vibes of the lab part. And also I could see more wall decor like that shelf you had but more, and maybe equipment shelves/lockers and other things, because I saw that fume hood looking wall thing and I really liked that. Love the fortress interior though it looks soo cool! lil jimmy and martin in the tubes are so fun"
0,22:46 I feel like at this point for the tank you should have made it a light green with some darkish green accents of the glass because I feel like unless the lab takes care of the animals well that’s what the color would be

0,"You should add a third tank, in which somebody (or... more like something) is floating. Something that got messed up by whatever is in that water. So it basically looks like that is what is going to happen to the other two.
You could even add one detail from the messed up one to one of the other two. So it lookes like the process has already started."

Also it would be so funny to give Jimmy cod as if he was holding it. Or attach his tank to power a holding cell full of cod 😂"
0,"Or put a creeping and a warden in a tube for experimentation - to play off of the skulk infection in cubs base, or that you’re experimenting how to use resin as a poison for your monster!"

3,Jimmy and Martyn better become snails
0,Also if you use glass panes in the corners of the glass blocks it will help round out the shape. If you want.
1,my favorite part of the new lab is the conversation pit in the middle!!!!!
0,9:28 skizz types like how he talks lol ❤
0,Suggestion. Fill the test tubes with water and bubbles so it seems like they're suspended in some sort of fluid.
0,"this is just a silly idea, totally on board with the current arrangements, i think this is starting to look cooler and cooler, but what if the guardians are in smaller aquariums around the big one, and in the big aquarium there's a tiny version of the sea monster, so it'll give more lore as to why the monster is attacking the village NOW when it seems like it has lived for thousands of years, because the scientist took the baby! (unless i forgot some lore) but i know that it might be hard to build that in such scale without sacrificing details, so the guardians will still look really epic!! great video as always gem"

So it looks like the ""asteroid""(?) slightly scraped into the wall on the way down, and it is still glowing hot (even if it was several months since the actual landing, or maybe it is some kind of ""snail magic"" going on to keep up the heat)... that could look cool :)"

And change your sign so it says 2 lives, the goal of the game is to hold THE tag in somebody video and without getting caught. If they call you out you can’t tag them but if it makes it into the video ore stream and they don’t Call you out with the tag there tagged and lost a life and also have to go change there sign if they want to play. Hope this helped if you were confused. And hope to see you participate in the new tag game for season 10!😊"

1,You got tagged 18:45
0,"Looks great. When you started talking about I was hoping you would make the top floor like . Frankenstein's lab. You should put water in the tubes with Martin and Jimmy like they are sitting in a saline solution (or a Bacta Tank). 
I
 noticed when you were adding to the lab room like stone which was suppressed to be like wiring and you left an opening. You should put red dust in there and every few blocks put a redstone lamp. every so often put a cooper grates instead of stone so the redstone could be seen 

Going with the Frankenstein's monster theme from earlier, maybe put a table with an armor stand laying down. for the head put the head of a warden and for the body just plain brown leather.

You should also make shelves with heads in jars on one of the walls. Maybe one for each hermit, maybe Steve and some of the mobs too to add to the old creepy lab. You can put some pale hanging vines to like like dust on the jar (and maybe the tubes with Jimmy and Martin). You should also shrink the Jimmy or Martin in the tubes a lot to look like maybe a cloning experiment going wrong, kind of like a fetus in a jar"
0,"It kinda reminds me of that one air temple from Avatar the Last Airbender, that had been taken over by technology"
0,"Could we get like a severed tentacle from the monster in the tank? Maybe as a center piece to really sell the lake monster experiment . Maybe it can grow back more of the tentacle if you feed it (that’s what the guardians are, tentacle food) then later in the season have it get so big it breaks the tube  and escapes or something! Two monsters now haha scientific hubris baby!!"

To save some trouble here are some main points unless they have been changed.
1. every player has three lives 
2. You must tag a player by showing the item in a hermits video with out them noticing what you are doing
3. If the hermit you are targeting quesions what you are doing then you are then not allowed to target them in that video again.  
3.  If tagged you lose a life once all three lives are lost you are out of the game."

45,The fact that Gem's green glass player-sized Science Tubes™ aren't even the first ones on the server this season (after Scar's POE bunker) is high canon Hermitcraft…but the fact that Scar _also_ has his very own containment tubes on his railway platform—and that Ren built a bunch of them in his Metro Mayhem section—is *peak* Hermitcraft!

1,"Something I never got is spoilers for streams and others showing parts of others' builds when they might not have shown them in their video.  If anything, it makes me want to watch the next video of that hermits collection to see the process of them building it.  Like this room, I have seen this completed lab in both grians and glin gems own live stream, and I'm still watching this video.

Like I understand wanting to see it in all its glory in the video, it was made in,  but seeing it in another's video at a glimpse or even in full isn't the full picture. Watching the process and their thoughts as they build it is just as much fun to watch

I guess what I'm saying is I feel the spoiler culture for hermit is a little too much. I feel it does great to advertise other  hermit videos.

Like, no matter the spoilers, I'm watching my main hermits videos. If anything, it'll get me to watch hermits I don't normally watch."

for the big tubes that jim and martyn are in, maybe put the same color glass panes on the diagonal bits (like the corners) of the tubes??

0,Inside the tank I would build some fishes with hermit heads. MAYBE you are transforming hermits into fishes to conquer the server... so evil
0,"For the tubes and what Grian was suggesting you could have a book somewhere describing the experiments, or signs with numbers measuring something, or how long they've been in the tubes. Maybe they're researching what is in the water, and how that might form these monsters that we only see in these waters. If so, one tube could be a person submerged in the water, and the other the same, but with a catalyst or something they have found in the water (fx near/ on/ or after an encounter with the kraken). The result would be that just the water has no special effect, but combined with the catalyst the person exposed grows mutated fish like features. Maybe the reason why the kraken is so big is because it's been exposed to this catalyst it's whole life. And if humans react by mutating into fish like creatures maybe the fish monsters in the water are, at least partly, fishermen and seafarers who vanished. OR something completely different :)"

10,"Hey Gem, for the lore: based on the shape and the type of battlements, you’re right in calling it a fortress, not a castle. It would be from the renaissance or later, meant to withstand cannons and such, and used by the military, not by nobility. None of this is relevant cuz the interior is ~1950s, and it’s your lore of course, but irl it would have had ammo storage and barracks instead of a throne room etc :]"

0,Considering hermitcraft lore I wouldn’t be shocked if we see Jimmy or Martyn in future seasons as full hermits 👀
0,"Gem, u should add ur records from the hermits favorite colors in the lab and a map too :)"
0,"When Grian came over I was in fact questioning if Jimmy was smaller than Martyn or if it was just the perspective... glad to see you did make him smaller, i would love to see how he reacts to that lmao"
148,8:23 wow has Joel actually managed to use so many froglights he's emptied the store! (only hermit i know who uses so many in every build)
0,Elder guardian’s range is 50 blocks. And it looks like your fortress is at least 100 blocks away from both Skizzleman and tango but maybe not Grian. Grian could be within the 50 block limit. Maybe you will want to get him since you been tagged
0,"Geminitay you have been tagged. The rules:

1 everyone that is playing gets 3 lives. You are out if they hit zero lives. 

2 to pass the tag on you must sneak it into another hermit’s video without being caught. If you are caught by a hermit spotting the tag you are not allowed to tag them again for that video or livestream. 

3 for now livestream due count if they are put up as a vod on YouTube. 

4 if it get stuck grian will add more tags if needed"
0,I know it's been quite a while since you joined hermitcraft by now. But i was remember when you were added and i really thought you would fit right in with the vibe back then and i was right. Thank you for being awesome gem💜
0,"Hey Gem, loving the interior! I know you mentioned having computers in the lab, a trick I like is using a pale oak sign in an item frame as a wired keyboard. Either way, I’m loving the build!"
0,"Interesting way to introduce/hint at the new hermits. I mean... what better way than to have the one who has been ""researching"" the hermits.... create new hermits? 👀"
0,Yessssss I saw your stream and watched grians video with spoilers but I was waiting to watch this video!
0,i love how the dead coral gives mold vibes
0,martyn and jimmy floating around like the lego star wars character customizer
0,"the elder guardian range is only 50 block and it has the over lay effect of seeing it face haunt your vision for a moment, could be spooky for some more strange activity, maybe have a milk vender in the village near the activity for lore and convenience"
0,so we all arent talking about the Etho altar anymore...?
0,I love watching  you build the interior and explaining your thought process as you go. Better than sped up. 👍

0,"This was a great episode! Well worth the wait! The lab looks amazing and I love the detail of Jimmy and Martyn in tubes. Did Jimmy escape to play Hungry Hermits then? Also the segment with Scar was so funny. You two should absolutely prank Skizz with an elder guardian, I imagine his reaction would be hilarious!"
0,You can make a beat out of the bone block clip😂
0,Oh no. Gem got tagged
0,Now there needs to be a Grian armor stand with tentacles for arms and maybe a fish tail.
1,"Little trick for pipes.  If you want to give them direction make them thicker the closer they are to the source.  Every time you branch off or have them split unmake them thinner and thinner.  The closer they get to the final destination.

The father a pipe is from the source the smaller it needs to be to create pressure."
0,U should do guess the build with mining fatigue

0,as a canadian that accent hurt
0,"Does turning off the gravity on the armour stands mean they're not affected by water? If so, bubble columns could look great in the test tubes. Love the build!"
0,"BTW Elder Guardian's range for Mining Fatigue is 50 blocks in a sphere, so maybe you can hide it under the base to only affect your target."
2,"Love the look of the lab, maybe adding glass pains on the cornerse of the test tubes could look great aswel !"
0,Imagine if season 11 started w jimmy and martin breaking out if the test tubes to be welcomed as the new hermits. 👀 i see u gem. Im 1 step ahead

0,I’d really like to see Vader in a bacta tank
0,"You should make the bodies float up and down! I don't remember who showed Mumbo, but I think there's something in the armor stand mod that allows you to move them in a cycle. He used it to make Big Ron wave."
3,18:45 You got tagged!
0,"Could it be that whatever leaked into the waterways and fed that monster in the deep outside has been harnessed and studied for use in DNA reforming in the lab hense the pipes, I wonder what else has leaked into the town below"
0,"50 block radius, it wouldn't reach anyone other than you unless they fly too close."
1,"Yes, put a small segment of tenticle on a bench under some bright lights and a tray of instruments beside it."
0,You could put a severed tentacle in one of the rooms to give the impression they cut it off and are testing on it!
1,Gem is very close to 2M! An early congrats for that!
0,You should make the room darker to make it spookier
2,"Given Tango's theme and the castle's proximity to him, perhaps Tango can provide the lab's Science Juice?"

0,Hey does anyone know why it's a huge deal to upset grian?
0,Hmmm... is there a potion for mining fatique? If the Elder Guardian gives it to you it is very apparent.
0,"Gem, I beg of you, use the connected texture pack, unconnected glass hurts my soul"
23,"Gem I have an idea
You need a industrial greenhouse to study all the new foliage and you can hide firefly bushes under the floor for bugs and use the orange copper stage so it doesn’t blend in with any plants"

70,"@27:35 The Wiki says that the range at which Elder Guardians bestow Mining Fatigue III is 50 blocks Radius. It doesn't say if that is spherical (like Spawners) or Square (like Iron Golems).  Depending on how high in the air you have it, the effect might not be too annoying to your neighbors, because at 50 blocks they'd probably be intruding on your base's airspace anyway (but I'm not sure of the actual distances on HC and I am TERRIBLE at estimating things.)"
3,"Oh, so y'all are planning to add some textures to the shore areas of the river. Here I was thinking you were going to leave it all mud and say it looked better like that.

That really is a nice blend of the medieval exterior and the modern, scientific interior.

Elder Guardians don't have that huge of a range. You could probably put one under Skizz's base, and it wouldn't reach anywhere else, provided the others didn't get too close. The only hint would be the jumpscare whenever the Elder Guardian activates its mining fatigue."
0,I would be fun if Jimmy and Martyn would look like monsters during the night but would look like themselves during the day. It would unfortunately force you to change the room to input the redstone so I don't know if it's worth it. The room is amazing

0,"Okay, hear me out... (1) Is the mod for the fanart gallery the same y'all used in New Life? and (2) Do Jimmy and Martyn still have server access?

I remember Owen and/or Pearl doing screenshot selfies, so if you DO turn Jimmy and Martyn into sea monsters, you could screenshot the before pictures of them in the tubes to have in an office or something with lore books about the process that they underwent. THEN for the sea monsters themselves you could make skins for that to get the heads... Which wouldn't have to be Jimmy and Martyn themselves, but I think it'd be fun if it was. 😂"

0,"Hi Gem, thanks for the cool build!

Regarding the Kraken, I have been thinking it has been lacking something for a while now.

The monster is meant to evoke a sense of inescapable dread.
Sailors are supposed to fear the shear size of even a single tentacle they cannot see the source of. Not even when under the water.
The must understand they witness but a fraction of a being that is more natural calamity than a living thing while in paralysing fear of what they know they cannot see but imagination and adrenaline fills in anyway.

That sense of scale and inescapable horror is best captured by the Kraken not actually bludgeoning or attacking to cause real damage.
It is the fact it is grabbing people and PULLING them to it. Like a snack. An inconsequential morsel of food to be picked at like a bag of peanuts.

And when finally witnessing the Kraken the moment before certain death they should bear witness to an overwhelmingly fathomless maw of unending hunger. Like an endless cavern of teeth and flesh that will instantly rip you into ribbons of viscera.


Now you have modelled your Kraken maw after the Minecraft glow squid beak. And while it is a good for what it is, it doesn't capture the depth that a kraken should have. Nor does it really evoke any sense of 'the beast hungers'. It is designed to transpose a 3d squid beak onto a 2d face.

Whereas you are not limited by hitboxes like the devs are. You can make it so your Kraken is integrated into the walls it's so big. That it's body is so immensely massive that is literally the terrain. 

It's gullet should be a bottomless abyss of just rows and rows of teeth.
An uncountable amount of sharp teeth that would rip apart monsters of FAR greater size than a mere human. This would truly capture the essence of insignificance and existential horror that anyone pulled into the depths of the abyss should feel."

0,You’re so good at building ❤
0,Hi! Gem!! I love YOUR vids SO MUCH!!!! KEEP IT up!! 👍🏻 ❤❤❤
0,"some notes for scar: to truly master the essence of skizz you have to hup, bop, and hnnggh with a side of some nooch and/or snoogins along with the occasional ""WHATIMAGONNADO"" and never forget victory sips

also giraffes are white, flamingos are hunchbacks, and police officers are blue"
0,Finally
0,You need some peepers from subnautica to fly around outside the aquarium tube!
10,So proud of everyone on Gems discord for not leaking the tag this past few days. You got tagged Gem!
0,Nice job.  The updates really give you builders plenty of tools to express yourselves.
5,"Gem, for the copper grates on the floor, you can waterlog them to make it look like they have water in them"
1,18:46 You Gem have been tagged
2,you could add pale oak planks to the walls for more texture. it gives it a peeling plaster or wallpaper kind of look
7,For the aquaium you could have it that the researchers found one of the river monsters eggs and have contained it to research it. May have a slightly cracked egg with a tentacle or eye showing through it using armour stands somehow. Could ask Cleo to help with it if needed
0,"Guardians don't attack fish, just squids and axolotls, so you could add those to the aquarium. I think they also don't attack dolphins, but since their AI is too stupid to survive regular aquariums, well, probably not sensible- still, some regular fish (and maybe pufferfish? not certain if they attack guardians) could work well to make it look a bit more interesting than just three guardians."
1,Gem is great
0,Just me or is the audio very quiet?
0,I wonder what could happen to Martyn and Jimmy in the future.
0,"There's a great photo of a cat resting on a Tandy 1000 EX computer on the Tandy 1000 wikipedia page that became a bit of a meme, I think the Tandy 1000 (with cat) could be a very aesthetic pick for 80s computers to put on the desks."
0,you have been tagged :D go talk to grian to figure out whats going on and how you were tagged :D
0,Seeing the scitties brought back so many memories😔
141,"Gem!-- the range of the elder guardian mining fatigue is 50 blocks, so you'd probably be able to have one  in the fortress without disturbing Grian. 
However, you'd hafta figure out where to put your farms thats out of the way, especially since they're all clustered around the fortress.
BUT!! maybe the lore could be that it somehow escaped the aquarium (if you make jimmy and martyn turn into monsters, they could destroy the test tubes along with the aquarium) it could escape to the monster in the water, and maybe it eats the elder guardian and steals its 'power' making the area around the monster have mining fatigue. which would just be deeper in the water, as the AOE is kinda small-----> this could also potentially ONLY affect skizz as its closer to his base, at least partially, if you do want to mess with him.
Just some ideas!"
0,"I was Watching the last hardcore series you were doing, and the videos ended about 5 months ago. I was wondering if it is over. I never saw any video saying it was over, so maybe you died off camera. Anyways If the series is still able to be continued it would be amazing if you could. I was getting really inspired watching you transform the villages."
0,HAH GET TAGGED <3
0,Gem you've been taged
0,Loving the laboratory.  Maybe electrical lines into the tank and a big lightning rod catcher on top for creation of Frankenstein's guardians?  Also...shouldn't Jimmy's armor stand be tiny?  😂
0,Scar Gem and Grian videos to watch today🎉🎉🎉🎉
49,27:53 - Scar's impression of Skizz is the best thing I've heard all day.
0,Gem got tagged
374,"Hadn’t noticed till this episode, but having other hermits locked up has turned into a Gem staple, considering last season she had a dungeon and this season she has them in test tubes.

Love it"
2,18:47  YOU GOT TAGGED!!
0,9:29 skizz is a Poe through and through
0,Is this one also from Dredge 😅
5,Doctor Gem's Evil Laboratory !!
1,Does Etho know your pillars and beams are hollow?
43,"You do something similar to what Mumbo did in his town and have a redstone contraption that drops the jimmy and martyn armour stands into the floor while sea monster armour stands pop up, and vice versa"
3,"Giving Scar work is the best, it may result in mobs being delivered I mean there's a 50/50 shot guardians are delivered."
0,I feel like a science lab needs a (goods) elevator!
0,"i appricate how jimmy's armor stand is slightly shorter

edit: oooh scar also noticed!!"
1,18:46 tagged.
0,"19:56 Mean Gill Martyn? Cod Jimmy?
26:54 I love how they both just basically went ""It's okay to be enemies with Tango or Skizz or Impulse... But not Grian."""
0,It does look so MUDch better!
0,"I double checked the Minecraft Wiki and the Elder Guardian applies Mining Fatigue III to a random player within 50 blocks for 5 minutes.

So, that's just a couple of blocks more than 3 chunks. It probably wouldn't reach the neighbors unless they were flying over.

Mining Fatigue III does also reduce attack speed to 70%, so it would be sad if it could reach any PVP zones of the base.

Also, it makes it almost impossible to break blocks (mining speed reduced to 0.27%), so it would be impossible to remove anything from the base without removing the Elder Guardian."
1,You’ve been tagged Gem 18:46
0,i think for the copper pipes maybe using copper grates that are water logged could be cool. it would make it seem like water is coming through it.
0,"Sorry, Gem. You’ve been Tagged."
0,Gem got got! Tagged by the pesky bird!
0,Tagged!!!

4,I love how you try to tie your base into those surrounding you <3 it makes it look so good
1563,"You could also add a couple more of those testing tubes with drowned in them. As if they are the ""failed"" results of previous experiments"
1,"The keyboard sounds so good, Gem!! It's really satisfying!"
7,"Now that I have watched you play dredge, and played a bit of it myself, I appreciate your build style more this season. I love the ideas and inspiration you bring to your builds and I can't wait to see the end result. Love the videos gem, they always make my day better 😊."
1,"29:14
You could ask Tango to help you animate the armour stands, to make the boys looks like they are banging the glass or swimming?"
1,We need to get Gem to 2mil
306,"Really love the interior, especially the use of the dead corals that fit so well with the hanging pale moss and the Martyn and Jimmy test tubes. My new headcanon now is that it actually wasn't the monster in the bay that drove the researchers insane, but rather them trying to figure out what the heck goes on inside Jimmy's head"
79,"Jimmy is going to be sooo mad when he hears about the lab, looking forward to his reaction!"

0,This isn’t the first time a whale has turned into a dolphin.
0,"Gem saying ""us Americans"" as a Canadian is great.

Yes, I know she lives in North America, but we all know that isn't how ""Americans"" is normally used."
0,Awesome
0,",,, does skizz have aphantasia? Genuinely baffled"
0,"I like how the point is that the colour is suppose to stay thru the builds, and the fist thing impuls does is try to mix people up"
0,"38:49 When you look straight at the side, the flamingo looks like an old pink pickaxe beaten up and breaking down😂😂😂😂😂"
0,Gem should have had eigengrau
0,"""No writing colors in books""
Joel: a WHITE owl"
1,"35:44 I mean Impulse already knew the little mermaid- what is THAT!?
38:42 Skizz has never seen a living thing before"
0,I think that hall of skizz fame should allow exceptions. That mermaid was an abomination. I laughed so much my stomach hurt. Incredible work from the master.
1,7:15: I instantly thought of the meme where disney comments „Its a dinglehopper you uncultured swine“ on somes post talking about ariel using a fork in her hair
0,That flamingo is in the wallace and gromit universe.
0,"They all know it's a flamingo, and it's been done 3 times. The beak has only been done right at impulse's try, because the beak is white and black."
0,why did skizz have to do ariel like that xddddd
0,I genuinely think Skizz is colorblind. The fact that he chose orange instead of green for Ariel's tail makes me think he's red/green colorblind specifically perhaps lol
0,"10:17 ""What's wrong with him??"" Meanwhile I'm yelling ""Give it a beak!!!"" At the screen lol"
0,30:07 sure skizz😅😂🤣🤣🤣
0,Jimmy has improved so wildly and i think skizz may just have aphantasia😅😂😂 poor guy cant catch a break lol
0,What IS skizz…
0,This is just Minecraft Gartic Phone
0,"Gem: “Yeah this is great!”
Skizz: **sobbing**
9:51"
0,Skizz!!! No he had the flamingo face at 6:32 and then ruined it istantly afterwards
0,Bro the evil laugh from grian when he put the bush down! It made me so happy. (29:27)
0,I thought the flamingo was a pig
0,"From the thumbnail, I tried guessing what it was and I'm not actually joking, my guess was ""a flamingo vacuuming/sweeping it's fallen feathers"" how did I do that. With skizz nonetheless"
0,The ads are getting rediculous I had 8 by halftime and none were skippable
0,"the switch from impulse making Ariel’s makeup and him going idk what im doing to grian just spam adding fish bc he has nothing left to do had me giggling so much LMAOO,, and in typical skizz fashion he left ariel bald 😢 

this ended up being such a fun round !!! love how there are more and more challenges being added and this one was u expectedly tricky but of course fun :3"
1,skizz's art would've actually looked fine on the atari 2600
1,"Watching skizz build while mentally screaming ""BIRDS HAVE BEAKS!""  It's the one thing that could've saved that flamingo"
0,i love how jim's build is just a massive beatles reference
0,"8:40 ooooh impuuuuulse, forgetting bamboo are we?
32:59 Ethoslab"
0,"It’s not a flamingo. it’s an old man, hunched over, wearing a flamingo costume and sadly hovering up the old bits of the costume that keep falling off. absolute genius. 🎉"
0,"I love how nonchalantly skizz’s flamingo is vacuuming the feathers, hand behind his back and everything"
0,Jimmys chicken was adorable! And the flamingo was soo funny 😂
1,"Diogenes, holding up Skizz's depressed pink monster: Behold, a flamingo!"
1,I always thought Ariel had orange hair until this video
1,Stormlight archive characters be like: 13:16
0,When I see a skis built I know I might die of laughter and I do lol
0,"Grian: this is a geminitay video
Gem: I will cut to impulse now"
1,7:45 accurate owl sound
0,Skizz glitching for a solid 10 seconds
0,"""I don't blame you for hating this"" IS SO WILD TO SAY ANSJSKKS"
0,skizz’s flamingo is my spirit animal
0,18:22 “US” Americans!? 😂😂
0,Skizz actually needs to stop using ender eyes
0,Jimmy speaks Skizz so well by now 😂
0,'It does look like a big old seal' - Jimmy. I LAUGHED SO HARD
0,"HOW DID JIMMY GUESS SKIZZ, BUT SKIZZ FAILED TO GUESS THE JOEL BUILD?!?!? (1st buils)"
0,Skizz... Love... A FLAMINGO IS A BIRD. BIRDS HAVE BEAKS oml.... XD
0,next guess the build: scar is invited and he has to add something to every build and you have to guess what he added
0,that skizz flamingo would legit make a cute stuffed animal merch
0,The little heads are so cute
0,The jack o lantern missing the bus: IM TAKING TOO LONG :(
1,"3:58 wait, this is the last episode?"
0,happy gay
0,imp and skizz being dads and still somehow messing up the disney prompts kills me every time
0,( 28:32 ) her tail is f*cking green
0,"Let me see the giraffe, Skizz in a bottle, and the Flamingo. Skizz’s guess the build hall of fame is here."
0,"luckily, buses are some of the most square creatures in existence"
0,"Grian: we all live in a yellow submarine / except for all the real ones, which are gray so they can't be seen

Skizz: it's as clear as day!
Jimmy: I thought you lived somewhere it never rains."
0,I’m so glad that skizz is a part of this series. 😂😂😂
0,"“What’s your favorite color?”
“Blue”
😫

Maybe it’s just Minecraft players and not just hermits lol"
0,That flamingo might be the best thing I've ever seen in Minecraft
0,Man I’m shocked these videos with Jimmy and Skizz absolutely mind-melding haven’t spawned shipping content yet. Just imagine the ship name.
0,sometimes i think skiz is playing on a flip phone
0,i had no idea submarines could be yellow and was so confused on why jim picked a submarine to portray yellow T_T
0,"Owl nerd here to comment on Joel’s owl because this has immediately grabbed my attention. If it’s a white owl then it is more likely than not a snowy owl, snowy owls have BLACK beaks. I know it’s Minecraft builds but the little owl nerd in me needed people to know that most owls do not have orange beaks. Thank you for listening to my little owl rant, for I needed to get that out."
0,Amazing cuts 😂
0,Grian laugh and the first flamingo 😂😂😂😂
0,"Hope they do more guess the build, I love these 😄"
0,"Ahhh, ok, I know I'm very late to this video but I loved it!! (I love all Guess the Build videos, but still XD)
Happy pride month everyone!! :D"
1,Skizz makes me feel seen and represented with his builds
0,We all live in a walking submarine
0,"Looks like it was made with, you know, longing. Made by a person really longed to see a flamingo."
0,Oh my! I'm laughing so hard at Skizz trying to guess what the whale is and the monocle that it's wearing! 😮😂
0,"42:45 In defense of Skizz, I probably would've guessed that it was a seagull carrying a migrating coconut over the ocean"
0,Omg I love the Bi flag on Gem's shoes! 💖💜💙
0,skizzleman just ruins the video man
0,I think they need to take skizz to a zoo or a safari or something and show him what animals look like lol
0,"18:23 Gem a proud Canadian, calling herself an American... 😮"
0,4:04 Grian Bob Ross moment
0,"I love how this particular game, in a series that is usually unhinged, is somehow even more of an outlier. The Flamingo was certainly memorable enough, but I'm never going to get over what was done to that poor mermaid. Skizz must have had horror movie clowns on the mind... I completely lost it seeing that one. Excellent game!"
0,5:35 it looks like a pelican
0,Would be so funny if they built a red schoolbus for red
0,"""Skizz has really not done me any favours here""
*Cuts to skizz*
""YEAH I'M AN ARTIST!!!"""
0,"Ok I just started the video, but please tell me that the water monster I saw in Grians hall of fame is Skizz’s interpretation of the little mermaid😂"
1,My stomach literally hurts! Skizz's Ariel almost killed me.
0,"skizz builds like now i did when i was 9, and honestly i’m proud that jimmy guessed the first build. my dad couldn’t guess for the life of him whaf i was building"
0,This video had me laughing so hard. I too cannot draw to save my life and found this very enjoyable.
0,"Can we all agree Skizz needs to be allowed to google for every single build? Actually, Make it mandatory lol"
0,It's A Dinglehopper Not A Fork But Okay..
0,"While I am sure these guys are tired of this particular series (even Grian says he is a little burned out on it), honestly it never ceases to entertain. I am literally wiping away tears.  Skizz, Jimmy, Impulse, Joel, Grian and Gem are a delight to watch together.  Particularly when building under pressure."
0,„So this is obviously a chicken“
1,Skizz is so bad I'm crying! 😭😭😭
0,Thank you for putting customized (and color coded!) subtitles on this video Gem! The auto generated ones are not the greatest so i really appreciate the extra effort :D
0,I need to see a montage of just skizz building it is too funny
0,I actually think Grian does the quick start cause otherwise no one would ever be ready. Like they get nervous to start cause they are afraid it's going to be bad so Grian is like....no think just do. it's brilliant way to get past that initial hesitation.
0,"I love Skizz, of course, but how the HECK did he HAVE the right colors for Ariel already and STILL MADE HER ORANGE?? Like he had the perfect blocks for her tail, hair, skin _in his hotbar_ ... and the next moment he's building with orange. Was losing my mind lmaoo"
0,"Genuinely question, has skizz ever been outside?"
0,28:12 my thought process when watching this was.. did skizz ever watch little mermaid..? 😭
0,oh my god the little chibi faces… so cute
0,"""For us Americans""

*glare*"
0,"When skizz said ""how about some hair,"" the feature most iconic to ariel, right when the timer stopped, i actually had to pause the video because I was laughing too hard."
0,The more I watch this series the more I’m convinced Skizz may have Aphantasia
0,I saw the thumbnail and thought it was a pink pickaxe
0,Someone tell Grian yellow subs exist. There's more than just military. There's YELLOW research subs. XD
0,"I saw the title and immediately said ""she knows what month it is and that's why it's rainbow isn't it?"" HAPPY PRIDE GUYS!!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

Edit: SHE POSTED THIS ON MY BDAY- OMG!!!!!!!!!"
0,Tell jimmy i swam with manatees in an unforgettable experience with my family and i reached for my phone to google what they looked like. I completely forgot they were even an animal.
0,Skizz is such a treasure. I am bawling my eyes out at 32:59 🤣🤣🤣
0,GAY!!!!
1,"Please no one ever, ever, EVER teach Skizz how to build animals. As a species we can't afford lose him and his builds. It'd be a crime."
0,"14:41 why did you put highlights on his ""eyes"" (holes into the void)"
0,"So Skizz clearly has Aphantasia, right?"
0,Not Skizz not knowing what Ariel looks like when he has a daughter 😭😭😭
0,Skizz with yet another masterpiece
0,the little head caricatures in the corner are so adorable!
0,"If there was Purple, I think an octopus would work well"
1,This video has the absolute best and the absolute worst flamingo's ever build in Minecraft.
0,"The way gem asks jimmy his favorite color and he responds with blue, you can hear the disbelief in her voice. Shes trying to see if its just the hermitcraft server thats obsessed with blue lol"

1,Skizz’s choice of eyes for the pumpkin killed me 😭😭
1,I'm convinced Skizz is AI😭
0,That Flamingo just screams depression. It looks like a flamingo incarnation of a person ať the end of their long shift😂
0,“that looks like a FACCCEE 😡 “ lord help me skizz because i don’t want to know what else you were trying to build there
1,8:28 that reminds be of the hipster whale from Crossy roads
0,3:55 😦
1,skizz makes me laugh so much i have tears some of the time i must say. particularly in this video obviously
0,I love the skizz flamingo honestly. Very evocative. Looks like it took off its bill like a tie and is now dejectedly vacuuming after a long day of office work.
1,I skipped past the last round of building (better that way tbh) and got blindsided by the My Little Skizzmaid and nearly passed out laughing
2,"8:11 WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE
A YELLOW SUBMARINE 
A YELLOW SUBMARINE"

0,Everybody say it with me ... SKIIIIIIZZZZZZZ WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?

0,Mommy im scared😭😭😭😭😭
0,"You think hoover is weird? In Dutch vacuum cleaner is ""stofzuiger"" which literally means ""dust sucker"""
3,"The submarine being yellow through and through shows just how much the British majority plays an influence in these.
Also the Grian-Skizz dynamic in EVERY single one of these is a masterpiece. And it looks like groundhog day too, EVERY time skizz makes something atrocious and Grian screams in agony."
0,"Skizz's flamingo looks like old asian granpa, the way it's hunched over and has one wing behind it's back"
0,fun fact cats eat grass to help digestion (and other reasons) so you should not automatically assume your cat is sick simply because it threw up some grass

0,Gay edition! :D
1,"42:36 'Skizz needs to go to a zoo'  I don't know why but this instantly put an image into my head of all the hermits & friends visiting a zoo together and Grian showing Skizz the Giraffes and Flamingos, pointing at them and yelling at him 'THIS IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE SKIZZ! LEARN FOR NEXT TIME!' and I can't stop laughing lol."
0,I love the lil head icons for the POVs. I’m curious who is the artist I can follow?
0,That don’t look like a submarine.
1,FOR PRIDE? PLEASE BE FOR PRIDE!!!
0,"_""A chicken?!""_ Again?! 🤯
Skizzie's bird recognition is seriously clucked up! 😂"
0,"science fact: red is the first color to fade away in the ocean, therefore submarines should be red for cameoflage, like some fish do"
0,"You know. I feel skizz. When he said his brain couldn’t come up with a flamingo I felt that because I think I have that thing where you can’t picture anything in your mind and I felt so seen cause i know objective facts about flamingos and their image but if I have to think of one, I just can’t."
0,16:19
0,"Does Skizz have Aphantasia? It's the inability to picture images, and it makes drawing things from memory impossible."
0,"I did this on my world, but it’s survival so it’s all the harder😂"
2,Happy Pride Month!!
1,i think skizz isn't able to picture things in his mind

1,"14:27 i felt that ""oh no"" frustration right across the other side of the world😂😅"
1,"Flamingos feet and beak are pink,!!!"
0,we dont have the sizz's giraffe in the hall of fame
0,“Colors speak loudly to skizz” which is what makes his orange tailed Ariel and flesh colored giraffe all the funnier
0,"I would love to watch a video where people teach Skizz tips and stuff, to help him with future builds."
3,HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!!!!
0,"skizz's whale actually wasnt that bad, it looked way better then he thinks"
0,I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time between Skizz’s little mermaid and the flamingo. 🤣
0,"5:44 we all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine"
0,"I actually just set that flamingo to my Home Screen, that is a delight (I’m gonna cry every time I pick up my phone now)"
0,That don't look like a submarine
0,"My first thought when Jimmy said his submarine was yellow, was a song not any thing about Jimmy's ability to actually build a submarine."
0,"10:00 this reminds me of that episode of Bluey where Indy is trying to make a model of a horse but she can't figure out why it doesn't look right and its because the neck is wrong. First it's too short and looks like a cow then it's too long and it looks like a giraffe. This flamingo neck is 10 shades of wrong and it's absolutely hilarious. Never change, Skizz, you're awesome!"
0,That flamingo truly shows that birds come from dinosaurs
0,"""This just looks like a gray blob"" Honestly ,pretty accurate description for a manaty."
0,"21:51 i love knowing why gem says 'oh my god' when jimmy says blue is his favourite colour
also your girraffe is actually really cute gem :D"
0,the flamingo just gets funnier the longer you look at it
0,I think skizz might be  trapped in a room his whole life and has only ever had things described to him through a 5 person game of telephone.
0,The first guesses were going so well until we got to skizz...
0,When did gem change her prompt from lobster doing its makeup to Ariel? Did I miss that change?
0,"What I appreciate about the way Skizz builds, is that he realises what he's doing is wrong, but he keeps going regardless. No crippling perfectionism for this guy.
and honestly that's kind of inspiring"
0,The bi sneakers on your skin are amazing!
0,Last episode of guess the buildi? 💔💔
0,"""Let's get a bit of blush in there. This is a GeminiTay video."" 😂💯"
0,wait is the premise they want the colour to be guessed at the end or they dont
0,I was surprised when people got bus and immediately used yellow cause where I come from we just use normal buses for school so they're all basically grey lol
0,i actually could not stop laughing when the hunchback flamingo was revealed 💀 literally had to pause the video so i could catch my breath
0,they need to take a family field trip to the zoo with skizz so he can learn what animals actually looks like. i feel kinda bad for him. it must be hard living life without being able to identify basic animals
0,the fact that skizz has built a flamingo before in one of the other guess the build videos and this one is 1000x more cursed 😭😭
0,Skizz is very unique you will never be able to build like him
13,"36:00 Bruh, that's worse than his giraffe build 🤣"
0,I can’t stop laughing 🤣 😂
0,The flamingo accident & The mermaid accident ❤
0,How on earth did jimmy figure out those monstrosities were a flamingo and a pumpkin?!?!
0,42:40 Gotta love skizz

3,Skizz implying the pumpkin rides the short bus 😂 17:00

0,"I would like to say, when I saw the thumbnail, I guessed Skizz's theme correctly, and I feel pretty accomplished by that"
0,too bad the giraffe playing limbo while painting toenails red  didn't make it to the hall of fame
0,manatee not a bad guess
7,"45:25 It actually circled back to the pumpkin missing the school bus, incredible."
0,"39:07 Love that Grian had no question that nothing would be more hall of fame worthy then this. He hesitated with the little mermaid, but the flamingo was too much."
0,Jimmy was SUFFERING
0,I'm loving the skizz's hall of shame idea
0,I love how Grian logic’d his way to the submarine being yellow

15,"skizz is the glue for this series he just makes it so so entertaining to watch. ill watch the video, see what he builds, and ill be so excited to see how the others react and im literally giggling to myself knowing whats behind those walls"
4,"7:22: is that a fork, or is she deeply religious???"
0,That Skizz Ariel is rough lol
0,"This series would not work without this perfect blend of builders.  You have Gem, Grain, and Joel all at A tier,   Impulse at B tier,  Jimmy is D tier, and then there is Skizz standing strong in his own ""s"" tier imagination."
0,4 out of 6 of these are somehow associated with water
0,"I just had to pause the video to cry with laughter at skizz’s mermaid 😂😂😂
Skizz you’re the best never change"
0,I havent finished the video yet but the incorrectly colored beaks in this episode is driving me INSANE 😭😭😭😭
0,Someone please take skizz to a trip to the zoo.

0,"18:20, ""A vacuum cleaner for us Americans"" Gem you're Canadian 💀"
2,Wait… this is the last episode?
49,"""Buses are usually yellow"" - Impulse forgetting he's working with british people"
0,Watching Skizz suffer from aphantasia gtb after gtb and nobody understanding that that's why the Skizz hall of fame is so expansive is as funny as it is sad
1,skizz had the right colors for ariel in his inventory and then popped out orange for no reason😭😭
0,I really liked Jimmies chicken. It was cute.
1,dying at the chicken guess CHICKENS DONT FLY SKIZZ 😭😭😭
0,"Gem“ try make sure your colour stays all the rounds”      Joel “ I, really gonna throw people of”"
0,7:28 why does the owl look like Z from surfs up
0,"I love the video, I hope gem and the hermits also do one for mens mental health months, since its also in june. You know for equality, because thats what its all about."
0,I thought it was a  pink pickaxe in thumbnail 😂
1,"Grian’s submarine looked incredible💛 Jimmy’s chicken was absolutely adorable, and his apples were great!🤍 Impulse’s flamingo was surprisingly good! That beak? Stunning!🩷 Then we have Skizz’s mermaid… which is quite possibly the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen💔😂"
9,"21:47 Gem “What’s your favorite color?” Jim “Mine is.. blue” *little Jimmy giggle* 
It took me a second and then I couldn’t stop laughing🤣🤣"
0,"I have an idea :D guess the build: mad libs, the first build has to be the start of the story, and then every guess and build has to continue the story

I.g the first build chould be a princess in a tower, then the guess would be a dragon attacking a princess' tower etc. 

The goal is to have at least one character survive to the end and/or have a fun story"
0,I kept seeing the thumbnail and thought it was a pink pickaxe… skizz…
0,"What about “shrink” edition for the next one, where the building area shrinks every round. So everyone have to build it smaller and smaller"
0,"Why is Jimmy's build of a chicken bobbing for apples so cute, what the heck!"
0,Skizz makes me so happy. Every time he's in one of these I laugh so hard I cry
0,We need a Skizz learns to build arc
0,"Skizz, we have multiple zoos in Arizona. Please go to one."
0,3:55 this is the LAST ONE???
0,"Someone along the way in this video mentioned it being the last one that was recorded in the session, and I think you can tell xD"
0,35:53 that is NOT my ariel
0,"I’m honestly impressed with Impulse’s vacuum cleaner. Really showing improvement in this game over time, strong work to him!"
0,That mermaid gotta be in a hall of skizz fame. Grian laught so hard and still didn't add it. I think thats a crime.
150,"29:53 Honest question, is Skizz colorblind? because his track record is proving time and time again it might be true. That aside, Ariel being part goldfish, 10/10."
0,I don't understand how Skizz has so terribly failed- this _has_ to be on purpose has he never seen an animal or living being before
0,I understand her question to Jimmy. Asking him his favorite color and its the same as many others in hermitcraft. I get it!! 🥰
0,Jimmys manatee is eerily reminiscent of skizz’s dolphin

0,Love how Grian and Joel did the same exact thing with the fishes.
0,The music change for skizzleman was so well timed
0,Skizz's flamingo looks like Markus from the vr videos 😂😂😂😂😂
1,These submarine builds were congested with fish! 🚡🚡🚡🚡
1581,I love how impulse and jimmy seem to get better as the series goes on and skizz is posessed by some entity from another planet that guesses what things look like based on stories it heard from captive humans
0,"""Skizz needs to go to a zoo"" 😭😭😭"
0,"Impuse got the color orange, so he decided to make a yellow school bus, with a lil wooden pumpkin in the background 😂"
3,33:13 Reveals begin
0,i feel like skizz somehow better understands really weird niche builds than simple ideas like a green apple.
0,"Grian: Whale theme
Skizz: Flamingo theme
My brain: ~Whalemingo~"
0,"Jimmy builds a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
Jimmy mi builds a yellow submarine, yellow submarine."
0,DID GRIAN SAY THIS WAS THE LAST EPISODE?? did he mean last recording for this particular set??
0,"MAJOR ""last episode of the session"" energy. Joel's owl and whale, Skizz's flamingo, Gem switching from a lobster to the little mermaid for the red theme, Skizz's... ""mermaid""
hoo boy"
0,"Aw I love how its rainbow themed, is it because of pride month? x3"
0,10:18 Maybe becuse he is missing  his hole BEAK
0,I guess happy pride?
0,"the guts of Grian saying ""submarines arent yellow"" and then building a vibrant blue whale."
0,"That first ""flamingo""... lol That was hilarious."
0,21:50 not Gem having PTSD flashbacks to hermitcraft
0,"shoutout for the edditing on this one, the cuts between ""this is awful"" and ""this is going really well"" are absolutely hilarious"
1,I will miss this series 😂❤
0,"The accurate first guess and then skizz comes ""that's a chicken"". you can't write this, it's gold"
0,"I have to admit although I knew there was a flamingo in this video, I did not realise that that was it in the thumbnail"
0,21:51 😂 the on going bit
0,18:53 I love how annoyed Grian by the yellowness of the submarine
0,"Joel, dolphins do have white tummies sometimes"
1,"10:17 ""WHATS WRONG WITH HIM?"" Maybe the fact it doesn't have a beak Skizz?"
0,"The concept of getting a color through is brilliant! I really like these new ideas coming in!

Also, Jimmy nailed it on the head that he was immediately looking at a hall of famer. XD"
0,the last guess the build series episode?! noo guys!! please make more 😭😭😭😭 3:58
0,"Gem: don't write your colour in the book 

Joel: instantly writes a colour.... Lol"
1,if i had a nickle for every submarine ive seen that looks like that
19,"20:26, 
The cut to Grian just creating chaos😂😂😂"
1,"In a game entirely about communicating with colors, Skizz received a prompt about an incredibly popular Disney character who is extremely recognizable by her iconic color palette. But when recreating this character for this game, Skizz chose to change the color of every single element of her color palette. 

The twists and turns that this man's mind makes on a daily basis need to be scientifically studied. 

Skizz is of the right age to have seen The Little Mermaid as a kid when it first came out. And he has kids of his own, and I'm certain he's watched Disney movies with them. I know, without a shadow of doubt, that he has seen the movie and knows what Ariel looks like. My mind is irreparably boggled."
0,Happy pride everyone❣️
0,The flamingo made th hall of fame but Ariel took me out for a full minute
0,"I think he’s awesome, but how does Skizz’s brain work? Like, how?! Love him to bits, he’s amazing, but I’m genuinely baffled 😂😂 Fab choice of theme Gem ❤ 🌈"
0,"as soon as Skizz did the orange tail i knew it was going to be a laugh. hen when everyone reacted i was howling.  cry laughing so loud my sister came to check up on me
lol"
0,Could it be that Grian's previous job or degree as an oceanologist is affecting how he's interpreting the submarine prompt?
0,In skizz's mind everything is a chicken unless it is actually a chicken in which case it is a duck.
0,13:07 Jimmy with an amazing win of being able to decipher all that is skizz
0,I’m just wondering why the flesh colored giraffe is not in the Skizz Hall of Fame
0,I am obsessed with the cute faces that show whose perspective it is
0,"I'm so glad skizz is in guess the build, he makes it so hilarious"
0,Me going “I wouldn’t get that in a million years” then him gets it immediately like. WHAT? I love it
1,So when is the Skizz flamingo plush gonna be available?
1,From the thumbnail I was thinking that was a cherry wood pickaxe mining gold.
0,Grians crash out over yellow submarines will keep me mentally fed for years.  😂
0,Grian giving his whale blush because “this is a GeminiTay video “ absolutely sent me. 😂😂😂

7,"43:35 You guys should totally have a meet-up build battle where you all go to the zoo (have fun first) then all choose a different zoo animal to build doing some kind of action! Sorry, it just sounds like it could be fun lol."
0,"We got not 1, but 2 absolute bangers from skizz this episode 🤣"
31,"38:40 
Could've sworn it was a pink hammer from the side profile and video thumbnail.

I watched Skizz attempt to build this and I was still gobsmacked when it was unveiled...
God is dead! Skizz killed them!"
0,I love the “pip” in the whales mouth in Grians first build.
1,Gem: alright a lobster..... Gem ten seconds later: the little mermaid thats the theme now.

0,I like the flamingo. It's giving tired middle aged man
0,"Quote-o-matic:

""It's that or a schoolbus.""

""I'm loosing my mind, I'm loosing my marbles. This just looks like a gray blob.""

""We lost the color and this is a crime"""
0,"Idk if it's intentional, but for the rainbow themed episode to come out right before pride month is pretty neat"
0,That flamingo looks like it had a rough day at work and it's coming home to clean house
0,From the video thumbnail I really thought the flamingo was a pink pickaxe.
0,impulse absolutely slayed that jack o lantern

0,Thx for the colored subtitles ❤❤
0,HAHHAHA SKIZZ MAKES ME LAUGH SO MUCH I LOVE HIS BUILDS❤❤❤
0,38:50 okay but I can actually vibe with this guy. Like I understand this flamingo even if he’s missing some bits and is a bit wonky
0,"I'm confused how they ""lost red"" was the bikini (if you can call it that), not red? Did that not count? But they did get blue?"
0,Not me thinking the red clothes on Skizz's ariel were something else 😂😂
0,"Skizz... flamingos have _beaks..._ 
Chckens don't fly..."
0,"18:56 joke's on Grian, because there's at least two yellow submarine in this world, and they're located on Lanzarote and Tenerife in the Canary Isles. The submarines are used to give underwater tours, and features large portholes, as well as TV-monitors connected to cameras outside the submarines, so that the passengers can ""observe the underwater world in detail."""
0,A CHICKEN IM SOBBING
0,1.99M SO CLOSE YAY

Skizz: Wait a minute--
Me: yes, thank you
Skizz: --she only has one fin!

0,I love gem sm bro
0,"...
You say ""rainbow theme"" 
But

1,Why is no one talking about Impulses vacuum cleaner. Has he never cleaned in his life
1,"8:24 it looks like a walking banana 😂



Skizz just broke this time"
0,"the thing about the flamingo vs the little mermaid is that skizz /chose/ the flamingo. he did it to himself. at least ariel he has the excuse someone else wrote the prompt and so it isn't to his best skills.

though all the chicken bobbings... those are definitely my favourites"
0,"Aw man I was excited to see Gem and the people behind her build a lobster :( one of my favorite animals (and foods)
Didn't Ariel make an appearance in a previous guess the build as well?


I have no comment on Skizz's contributions to this video."

but on the other hand, jimmy's builds were actually so cute in this round!!!!! 10/10 loved the chicken scene, and the manatee i wouldn't have guessed what it was, but it was still so cutteee <3 !!!!!"

0,I am just- always astonished by skizz

0,"8:15 don’t worry Jimmy, I think we’re all too distracted by poor Skizz’s flamingo to come after your submarine 🥲"
0,i love Jimmy preemptively laughing before skizz's mermaid is unveiled

0,someone doesn't remember that things have necks.
15,"3:58 WAIT THERE NOT GUNNA BE ANYMORE AFTER THIZ
or 1z th1z the last one they recorded"
0,The number of times I’ve seen everyone else look up a reference image on Google. I wish Skizz would just do that once. Just so he knows what the animal looks like a little bit while he’s panicking and unable to think clearly.
1,"Gotta agree with Jimmy, the mermaid build is maybe the worst thing I've ever seen in this series. It's almost aggressively bad whereas the flamingo just looks goofy."
0,"Please build Skizz's Flamingo in the hermit craft Museum, or hide the mermaid in Grians base!"
0,I’m curious about the ratio between those who know what yellow submarine is and those who don’t.
0,"Dude, it’s 10pm and I’m laughing harder than I’ve ever laughed before. THE COMMENT ABOUT SKIZZ WITH NOTHING BUT  PENNIES AND A STRING 🤣🤣🤣"

0,"Omg I'm legit crying. Skizz.i love this man 😂 but the flamingo killed me. I had to paused the video and i couldn't breathe 😂😂
ETA: the mermaid! Whyso large. Whybso orange? WHY DOES HER BODY LOOK LIKE A GIANT MOUTH???  Oooh Skizz 😂😂😂 i love how Jimmy reacted ""he said it's obvious.... what is this?"" ""I know for a fact this wasn't a manatee"""

0,"H... how does someone screw up a flamingo THAT BAD? Skinny head with a beak, long neck; skinny head with a beak, long neck; why is the head just two blocks thinner than the body with a short pudgy neck?"
0,You guys should do a new cast every now and then. Id love to see bdubs
0,My perents ask my why I'm laughing a 2am : 32:15
0,i think skizz needs to review his birds… flamingos have BEAKS (and black feet but that’s not terrible to get that wrong) AND CHICKENS CANT FLYYYYYYYYY
0,When I am watching these videos I always wonder what the world looks like to Skizz because I refuse to believe that he just doesn’t know what anything looks like at all
0,"honestly I'm impressed by skizz, I haven't seen someone more talented than skizz in being the best at making living creatures something completely different and horrifying. now that takes real talent to take the shit out of beautiful creatures. 😂

edit: 21:31 seeing such a detailed builder that cares about builds and that is honestly making me think he has atelophobia (whatever its called) which is joel, then right after him we see skizz made me burts out laughing from hoe horrific that build is (wait i didnt notice the orange think was the jack o lantern until i saw the prompt 😭🙏🏻)"
0,21:46 scientist break

0,"i love how the toilet paper was on the RIGHT ear, not the left xD"
3,10:22 brooo the beak!!!
0,"Okay, not everyone can be a good natural 3D builder and I think Skizz has improved. Not every build is wonky. But I feel sad for him. Everytime he went silent I have the feeling that the words hit hard. When he gets loud, he is okay, that is Skizz, but silence... I hope he feels okay."

0,skizz's ariel is a monster
0,Grian’s laugh when he first sees Skizz’s flamingo is probably my favorite part of the bideo
0,Is it only me or does skizz’s flamingo look like a pink Godzilla?
0,As someone with aphantasia I really think skizz needs to look into it because there’s no way that man can imagine images with the way he builds
0,I am not a good builder but someone has to give skizz a children book about animals
0,"I don't know what you're all talking about, that is very clearly just an old man flamingo. Definitely."
0,"I didn't know Gem was an American. Gem, why do you have so many British friends?"
0,"Well, at least the flamingo is pink. It could be flesh 😅😂"

1,"Given when this was posted, I thought it was going to be pride flag themed, and although it wasn't, I'm still not dissapointed because it's guess the build"
1,"I always love how Skizzes guesses are always so wrong and include the phrase, ""I mean That's obvious."" XD"
0,"its always so hard for me to follow who is who. I feel like i need to be apart of the group to understand alot. group meaning figuratively and that I've needed to watch alot of others to understand who is who. everyone always talks abt skizz and im always trying to find out who that is, I find him once and a while but I'll end up losing him and vice versa for everyone else."
9,"8:05 honestly looking at that flamingo, it could have been vacuuming its melted body parts instead..."
0,I feel like Skizz builds are beautiful examples of outsider art
0,Poor Gem having to be surrounded by people who all have blue as their favorite color.
0,I am absolutely baffled that Jimmy got Skizz build correct.
1,skizz's mermaid has hyperpigmentation
2,You needed three extra colours in the dispenser so that no-one was sure which colours were part of the builds as 3 wouldn't get picked.
1,"21:50 The Hermitcraft experiment continues, and the results seem conclusive."

15,36:48 it’s hyperpigmentation
1,Skizz's flamingo looks like its been through 2 divorces and their children no longer speak to them
1,Sometimes I wonder if Skizz has aphantasia
0,When Jimmy guessed exactly what Skizz's flamingo built was 🤯!!!!!
0,Omg the sad jack o'lantern! 😂 Technically there are 3 types of chickens now so even more colours.
0,This game was so cursed. The only line that didn’t end up cursed was the submarine and the owl if you don’t count it turning into a chicken 😂
0,jimmy doesn’t get enough credit for deciphering skizz speak
0,"At the very beginning of the video, I guessed Grian got blue, Impulse got orange and that Gem would get red

I'm so surprised I got those"
1,- how about some hair? - NNNOOOOOOO
0,"Jimmy being the one to guess Skizz builds saves so much grief :D
He just has a knack for figuring it out. Usually."
0,Almost at 2 mil!
0,these videos makes me non stop laugh that it hurts at those moments with skizz and what is builds are😂 skizz is the best
629,"Minor spoilers


I really like how both Grian and Joel had two minutes left and were just like ""how many fish can I spam into this build in these two minutes."""
0,can someone take skizz to the zoo?
0,"Skizz saying ""How about some hair?"" as the timer stops gets me. That's so funny."
0,I can't with skizz crashing out building that flamingo 😭😭😭
0,When I look at that flamingo I can’t help but see a pink oil pump jack lol
0,i feel like most people can sorta figure out their way into understanding how colors and shapes work when making art but after all these guess the builds I think the one exception is Skizz.
0,I freakin LOVE the little icons for everyone! They're so ADORABLE >w<
0,Great video. I hope one day u could make a video like this where we the viewers are also in the dark about what everyone prompt is. Will be fun also figuring out what Skizz is building
0,You guys should do an episode where you teach skizz building techniques 😅
0,"8:14 I wanna make upset Jimmy

It doesn't look like a submarine. It's looks like a banana walking in land"
1,"I dont know why you keep inviting Skizz, even in hermit craft. His not a good builder and thats why hermit craft is all about and in here guess the build where he just ruins everything"
0,"GEM! (and GRIAN since he heads this series) Video ideas for a friend, have someone who isn't on ""guess the build"" do  a video where they pick one of your prompts from each video and show what yall made in 5 minutes, and then they recreate their version of that prompt but they get like 30 minutes or an hour, but they get to make it bigger and cooler, and they have all of the context from the video. It would be great content for someone who wants to take on that task. Maybe they could pick one build or prompt from each video since the crew puts out 6 videos at once. Thank you."
1,let's all just note that skizz had green terracotta in his inventory. and he used orange for ariels fins
1,"This actually wasn't my expected take on the prompt but it was really clever and tricky ❤ As a former Floridian, it was fun to watch people building flamingoes and manatees 😂❤ (I also like that flamingoes ended up in here given that Pink Flamingoes is a popular cult classic that fits very well into this month (definitely NSFW though, from what I've heard and the clips I've seen).

I love that the Skizz flamingo ended up in the Hall because it's adorable, and I honestly think there have been much more confusing Skizz builds than that one...such as the orange Ariel, or the one where someone was hiding from the police and they were blue thumb people or something 😂❤ Tbf though, I also gotta say that IRL ""red"" hair is not (unless dyed) like, bright apple red, it's usually more of an orange color and we just call it red. So I think if the bikini and tail were the right colors, people still would have guessed Ariel. It's just that Disney used very bold red with their cartoon magic, I think she also had sisters with bright blue hair or something which is not IRL natural either. (Actually it's additionally cool that the Little Mermaid ended up in a video for this month if you know anything about the inspiration behind one of the greatest Disney villains ever imo, Ursula ❤)

For Joel's, I could see the owl, because he definitely made the face round. But at least it remained a white bird at the end 😂❤ As for his whale, though...I'm honestly not sure what happened there 😅 but I loved the resulting guess and build.
Thanks Gem, this was hilarious 😂❤🎉"
0,I think it would be so funny to send skizz to build school and everyone helps teach him how to build like animals and stuff
0,"Oh, the thumbnail was a flamingo, I legit thought it was a pink pickaxe, and was like, why is that pickaxe pink?"
3,Skizz' little panic attack over the flamingo had me howling. That man is a gift to this series XD
1,Wait Jimmy actually got Skizzs build! I'm actually impressed. Although i'm not sure which is worse. Skizz's flamingo or his Ariel....
0,I’m watching Skizz build Ariel in so much abject Horror bro. Like I can’t do better but the color choices alone are terrifying

0,every single cut to skizz KILLs me
0,i was laughing so so so so so hard during this
0,Lmaooo the blue curse is real gem disappointment at jimmy fav colour lol😭
0,The flamingo was a Skizz masterpiece but I’m over here thinking his mermaid should’ve been the hall of fame cause of the attempt of 3D that looks like 2D plus the incorrect colors lol
0,Impulse calling his flamingo bad when it's actually one of the better ones in this series XD
0,32:18 skizz broke
15,19:53 was not expecting Impulse with the flawless Scar impression

0,I laughed so hard at skizz builds that my stomach hurt
0,Petition for skizz to go to a zoo and see other living things
7,Skizz is never allowed to build mermaids again. I feel like this isn't the first time he had built a cursed mermaid.
1,both joel and grian finishing early and then spamming fish buckets for 3 minutes 😭😭
4,Happy pride month!
0,"Grian: Colours speak strongly to skizz. 
The giraffe: *Am I a joke to you?*"
0,"Every time I see the skizz lava lamp in the background, I keep thinking someone is just popped in and watching them each build their prompts, and I keep expecting someone to turn and be like ""what the--??"" 😂"

0,I fear skizz is getting better at building
0,I don't think I've ever laughed this hard 😂
144,I have to say the posture on Skizz's flamingo actually does capture the drudgery of vacuuming.
0,The cuts to Skizz were diabolical 😂 I think my favorite was “Skizz hasn’t done me any favors.” “I’m an artist!”
3,i really love that all of them thought of the yellow submarine!! it is so iconic
0,Skizz is such a gem in building. It's the Skizz world and we are only allowed to be in it to admire his art.😂😂
0,Happy pride!
0,The flamingo happened and I was crying inside and outside. The whale happened and it was recovered. Then the owl happened and I'm just done 😂
0,"I am CRYING LAUGHING at that ""mermaid"" skizz built 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
0,36:50 that's some hyperpigmentation
0,Bless Jimmy for knowing that atrocity was a flamingo. I would have maybe guessed a plucked turkey or a chicken pig hybrid.
1,21:50 ITS ALWAYS BLUE
562,"13:20 I couldn’t believe Skizz just said “it’s obviously a chivken” so I went to my mom and asked her what she thinks this creature is. She, a woman that has not once in her life played minecraft, correctly said that this is an owl. I’m laughing and crying at the same time"
6,"7:46
Joel making the sound his creation makes"
0,"Two fish are in a tank. One says to the other, ""Hey, do you know how to drive this thing?"""

6,19:45 thats definetly a snake. A very cute snake. But definetly looks like a snake.
0,Gem you totallt shot yourself in the foot by changing it to Ariel instead of a lobster (or something else red)
0,“Try and get your colour all the way to the end” skizz and his colour blindness* is really gonna send this off the deep end isn’t it 😂

35,"Another great Grian Quote: ""Oh lord, have mercy on your soul!"" 39:05"
29,I love Grians aggressiveness with the fact that submarines are gray. 18:51
0,Skizz somehow managed to build hyper pigmentation 😭💀
0,LAst episode ??!!?!
2,It would be cool if they did this again but their goal was to get their colour to the end without anyone guessing what their colour was. So they’d have to make it super abstract like building a bird if your colour is orange and hoping everyone includes a beak but then they guess white in the end
0,HOW DID JIMMY GUESS SKIZZES BUILD?? i would be so confused
0,I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PICKAXE IN THE THUMBNAIL

0,36:50 why does Gem say “Skizzzzz” exactly like Paul says “Carllll” in llamas in hats 😭 its the same inflection and everything
0,Skizz: fyi. birds have beaks.
1,I was munching cereal while watching this and nearly died choking when they were doing the reveal of skizz’s builds XD Grain’s manic laughter certainly didnt help either
0,why does everyone assume all birds have orange beaks 😭
1,Did you get kicked off the hermitcraft server or something?
0,skizz is so precious
0,"I love everyone focusing on minute details but missing the most significant features. Skizz worrying over what colour a flamingo’s legs are, but forgetting the beak, Joel deciding that the eyes are why the whale looks off, despite the whale having no fin on its back. It’s beautiful."

0,"I'm not the only one that said ""uh oh"" out loud when Skizz said he was doing a flamingo, am I?

I remember his last flamingo attempt and all I can say is... Thank you Skizz, because I can't build for shucks either. <3"
0,I refuse to believe that Skizz is a father if he doesn't know what Ariel looks like.
0,"Skizz, somehow, inherited HP Lovecraft’s imagination, but made adorable"
2,happy rainbow month :)
0,i love how skizz picks one of the most recognizable animals and proceeds to make it the most unrecognizable monstrosities i’ve ever seen in my life😭😭
1,In limited life Joel really wanted to build a submarine and now that he gets given the prompt with a submarine he has to google what it looks like 😫😂
2,"2:29 seconds
Me:  I cannot wait to see skizz build a friggin flamingo
🤣🤣"
0,I think they are getting worse and worse at building in this series. Maybe pretending to be Skizz messed up with their brains.
0,"Traditional sirens somewhere in between the mermaid version and the bird version actually had two fins, and that is what the Starbucks logo is so when Skiz gave her two fins that's what I thought of"
4,this is some real iconic Skizzing
0,How. How jimmy. How did you get that guess perfectly from skizz's flamingo monstrosity
0,Lobster turns red after cooking :D So good thing that you switched to mermaid

0,Am I the only one wondering if white is actually on the rainbow cause ummm i feel like it’s not
0,We need to get Jimmy and Joel to join the rest of the GtB crew in some REPO
0,It is traumatizing how regularly Skizz can make a build that is so offensive on the eyes.
0,"Jimmy's chicken bobbing for apples and Impulse's little flamingo were both cute =)
Very entertaining--especially the flamingo and discount Ariel!"

No, that's a good Flamingo.👏👏👏👍

Love you too Impy🫶 Sorry for stating the obvious🤫🫣

16:30 🤦😂

20:07 I take it ALL back! Impulse at least got the one leg part of the Flamingo, but ""Is that a cherry tree he's building???"
0,"10:25 Love you Skizz, but the defining characteristic of a Flamingo is... IT STANDS ON ONE LEG!!!!🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡

I hope Jimmy knows Skizz🤞...
 
YEAH! Jimmy and Skizz ARE on about the same level though🤣😂🤣😂🤣

28:20 it's also green Skizz!!!🤦🤣"
0,"Re: round 2 guess - leave me out of this, skizz."
0,how can it be possible that skizz knows and watches a lot of movies BUT can't recall what ariel from the little mermaid looks like lmao
0,"the flamingo prompt was so promising, and then I got to here ( 8:09 ) and I have no clue what's happening😭😭🤣🤣

edit: HOW DID JIMMY GUESS THAT RIGHT💀💀💀"
1,im convinced that skizz has never seen an animal in his entire life
0,"Gem, you sound like an elementary school art teacher observing your students art projects."
0,Can everyone use Gem’s indicators from here on out?-👁Arc Anna
0,Skizz does not have a good time recognizing birds

0,"Skizz only starting to place down blocks for the Ariel build a minute in, only to scrap it and start over completely at minute two sounds about right."
0,The faces in the top left are adorable!
0,35:55 is possibly the worst skizz build ive ever seen. I laughed soooo hard
1,"Honestly I love the flamingo, it looks like a dad vacuuming"
1,"This guess the build round has illuminated the fact that gem cannot build vehicles. Kind of strange cause she’s well rounded as a builder otherwise. 

What if you tried to build the characters from the Pixar movie cars? Since they’re living cars you may be able to treat them as organics."
0,I can relate to skiss’s flamingo on a spiritual level
2,Grian HOWLING at Skizz's builds will never get old lmao
0,The worst part is that I saw the thumbnail and did manage to land on flamingo vacuuming but not before nearly laughing myself out of my chair
0,I see what you did there with the theme 🥳
0,somehow the thing im the most distraught over is skizz calling that owl a chicken.
0,Jimmy's favorite color being blue Gem's survey is so diverse
1,"So from this round of GTBs we have firmly confirmed that Skizz has never seen any bird in his life ever. Flamingo, chicken, seagull, owl, duck.. nope. I think the next hermit outing they all do requires them to make a zoo trip for reference!"
0,"The Skizz flamingo ranks right up there with the Skizz giraffe from several months ago 😂. I get it though, the pressure of a 5 minute build can get to some people 😅"
1,32:48......
0,WONDERFUL VIDEO + HAPPY PRIDE MONTH 🔥🌈
0,Gem referring to herself as an American has me dead 😆😆
0,ariel the hairless mermaid and the poor flamingo that lost his back got me dying😂

0,Happy pride month! < 3

0,That flamingo got gamer posture fr
0,Guys is it just me or is smalishbeens (cannot remember his name for the life of me) whale look like a snake
0,I’m crying at Skizz’s Ariel and flamingo build 😭😭😭😭
0,White not making it was on Gem since white isn't part of rainbows.
0,What i cant get over is the fact that if Gem had gone for Lobster we would not have the gutbuster that is Skizz's Ariel
4,"13:46 A Chicken,??!  😂"
0,the thing is skizz already built a flamingo on a gtb video before and it was WAYY better than this one 😭
0,That Ariel is a crime against humanity
1,"Sometimes watching Skizz build is like watching dora the explorer.

""Can YOU remember what a flamingo looks like?""
It has a beak! 😀
""👁️👁️""
A beak Skizz!
""Does it have a hunchback?""
Any kind of beak, Skizz please! 😟 Even if you don't make it black and hooked, it's a bird it needs a beak!"
0,jimmy has become an authority at decoding skizz builds
0,"What in the herbal infused air was Skizz breathing ? 😂😂

1,"Can we get a Hermitcraft & Friends journey to a zoo vlog during our next large charity event, with the sole purpose of showing Skizz what the hell a Giraffe and Flamingo look like?"
0,8:11 Jimmy’s submarine definitely looks more like a submarine than whatever Skizz is building does a flamingo
12,Grian crashing out at 33:43 😂😂
617,"Grian: Debating for ages on if the submarine should be yellow or gray

Joel, instantly: yeah I think it's a yellow submarine"

0,"26:15 ""....What does Ariel look like?""

SIR!!!"
130,"Please never stop with these because Skizz getting roasted for his builds constantly is such a highlight. That poor poor flamingo. I'm also astonished that Jimmy managed to figure out what it was. (And, he said as soon as he saw it that he thought it was Hall of Shame worthy and it indeed was.)"
0,The flamingo is just... I lost it when Skizz was building it but it got so much funnier when it was revealed!
0,love the rainbow theme just in time for june :)
1,"It's so funny how everyone instantly thought ""yellow submarine"" despite the only reference being the song! hahaha :D No real submarines are yellow yet.... they all knew :D"
1,"I genuinely though groans prompt was unshakable, I forgot that we have a skizz in the mix-"
0,Rainbow?!?!  Is anyone still using Rainbow today???  Rainbow hasn't been updated since Bukkit was replaced by Spigot!
19,35:53 OMG I actually cried laughing that is SO CURSED 😂
0,10:17 why those he forget the beak 😭

0,why does skizz keep making carpet people broad but 1 -2 blocks deep?
0,"first the giraffe, now the flamingo. does skizz know what any animal looks like? :'D"
18,28:22 The fact that Skizz has nothing built 2 minutes in is sending me
0,20:26 the hard cut to grian just spamming fish everywhere is Killing me idk why it's so funny
2,"2:38 I see the reference there Jimmy, even if it was unintentional. That is a good song by the Beatles."

0,What would happen if they did a guess the build in vr
28,38:48 GRIANS LAUGH IS KILLING ME 😭

0,OMG that theme choice though! Happy pride month everybody 🏳‍🌈🌈
0,It's not a guest to build video unless skizz it's like muttering and making anxious noises. I want a hug skizz .
0,Skizz's little mermaid actually makes me mad. The way THAT didn't make the hall of fame is a crime.
0,I hope that with the creations added to the Skizz Hall of Fame that Grian is also copying over the book prompt for each one because I think it's really important to keep that context.
0,Grian: lets add blush. This *is* a gemini tay video.
0,Jimmy building a yellow submarine now has a certain sing stuck in my head
0,Skizz's brain is back to being weird. For a second in the other videos I thought he learned something.  Phew...

18,29:30 Grian being unreasonably proud of his apple 😂
0,"Impulse - 'we dont have any yellow stairs and slabs' - so, bamboo just isn't real. just ignore the bamboo. It's not important. You made up bamboo, it doesn't exist."

0,"32:43 ""skizz has not done me any favours here"" *literally two seconds later* ""I AM AN ARTIST BRO"""
1,I'm at like the 5 minute mark and i had thought it was very clever of Gem to go with the lobster since in popular media they're very known to be red so the colour would propably stay till the end- THEN CHANGING IT TO BE A LiL MERMAID AND IM SURE SHE WILL BE REDUCED TO JUST A -MERMAID- which could be any colour!!! I shall watch forward and see how this turns out😂
0,love how grian actually kinda says his colour at the start since he had blue and said turquoise

0,WHITE owl 😭😭😭😭
0,skizz really baffled me this entire episode…
0,"I was hugging my puppy and he saw Skizz's flamingo and he started crying. Skizz, you should be ashamed of yourself, you made a baby cry.

edit: I have 3 dogs on my bed, 2 by my head and 1 at the bottom of the bed, Both by my head are so disgusted by Skizz's flamingo that they'd rather be on the floor.

edit 2.0: The 3rd dog, the one at the bottom of my bed, sensed the horrid flamingo and had to hide under my bed."

0,the way i IMMEDIATELY knew this was gonna birth a new Skizz classic

0,I love the freaking cartoon faces! They are ADORABLE!!!!!❤ >v<
1,WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
1,The Jimmy in constant denial that it looks like a submarine is everything 😂❤
2,"I’m glad Jimmy suggested the mermaid for hall of fame as well. I think if she had been bald like she was at end if time, it would have won over the flamingo. Also - Jimmy guessing that flamingo was INSANE. he has a Skizz translator in his brain or something because HOW???"
6,"I did the exact same jack-o-lantern design that Impulse made last Halloween!!

Also, it would be so funny if someone built the Hall of Skizz on Hermitcraft. This is art, no argue about it."

8,"""this is terrible!"" says Impulse, building the most accurate flamingo beak so far"

0,"I have never felt so physically weak and sweaty from laughing so hard, I feel like I just got home from a 12 hour workout with a lich as my spotter draining my life force away until I was just skin and bones. Skizz please never go to a zoo or watch a disney movie please I need this. Life is beautiful (speaking of which, got the rainbow theme in just before june lol, happy pride! <3)"
0,yay
7,"I am NEVER recovering from Skizz's Ariel and Flamingo Builds 😂
I'm also impressed that Jimmy managed to get most of them right"

1,I love how Grian was crashing out over the colour of the submarine 😂😂😂
0,"27:38 and here I was like, Joel knows what a submarine is, he built one in Limited Life"
0,"Does skizz have google, does anyone know?"
1,the flamingo weirdly looks like a pink Big Bird from sesame street.
3,I like the idea of Joel and Skizz both stressing out over having to build an accurate looking bird that someone else has to guess.
0,Few things make me giggle like British people saying the word Blob
1,15:18 he knows his best friend well
0,The flamingo looks like an ostrich that lost all of its feathers gem😂👍

They really do need a family trip to the zoo"
0,Love the hall of shame for skizz
0,where to donate for Skizz's zoo ticket?
0,Rainbow theme on Pride Month let's goooo!!!!!
0,"I'm pretty sure at this point that Skizz is a mid tier Aphantasiac, if not a few steps higher."
1,"I thought the premise was to try to have the correct color appear in the final build, but not to have the final person succeed at guessing the color.

I was really confused with how everyone was reacting at first going through at the end, but I thought there was a different game going on. I do like the game that I thought it was - a trade off with needing to tie the color to the premise to get it to the end, but subtly enough or with enough other elements that people can't guess it."
0,Gay edition 😮
3,"13:15 ""This is a chicken"" ABSOLUTELY SENT ME LMAO"
0,30:06 SKIZZ???!?!?!.?!
1,skizz's etho deserves to be in the hall of fame. he's recreateable

339,"24:00  Yes, Skizz.  The standard brown toilet paper.  Over here, I have white toilet paper."
0,21:50 just the agony of the fav colour being blue in gem's vice is chef kiss
0,"I think the mermaid deserved the Hall nod over the flamingo, but really, I think we have to bend the (brand new) rules and let both in."
0,6:24 i was eating and at this shot i bursed out laughing. Um.... Don't eat during these videos 😅
0,"18:10 ""for us americans"" bro you're CANADIAN"

3,"4:51 Thank you for saying ""terracotta"" instead of ""flesh color(ed)"" like y'all have been."
0,"I always love GtB videos for all the laughs, but I love the little extras that get edited in by different people. Probably Gem putting the chibisvs Minecraft faces to help keep track of who's POV is my favorite
Edit to add: Skizz's mermaid turning everyone into a squeaky toy is the best way to summarize this series 😂🤣"
0,Skizz doing animals in 5 minutes be its own series
0,Those chibis at the top AWWWW I LOVE EM'!!!
0,"Looks just like the yellow submarine at liverpool airport Jimmy, well done 😂"
1,"i disagree at the end that the flamingo was the worse skizz build than ariel. the flamingo was at least recognizable as a flamingo, there’s 0 world in which that was ariel LMAO she was also stabbing herself in the face while the flamingo was clearly vacuuming"
0,That flamingo looks like it got home from a long day at the zoo and needed to do some chores.
28,"""Buses are usually yellow"" Impulse forgot he's playing against 3 brits, who are more likely to think of red for a bus"
5,"impulse thought his flamingo beak was terrible, but he legit got the closest of anybody to that point"
0,Has Skizz ever seen birds before?
0,Lobsters are not red. Until they're cooked 😢
2,Um grian what do you mean this is the last video in the guess the build series
0,Jimmy is just missing a suspiciously rich man holding a game controller on his prompt. 🎮
0,skizz needs to find the middle ground of people sizes
0,I love how these kind of videos have been coming out for so long now that we don’t even get an outro for them. We kinda just know what’s going on
9,"At this point, I'm impressed with Skizz's ability to make things confusing. It's a gift."
1,13:23 i love you skizz. Indeed it  is a big chicken
1,"I could not stop laughing the Skizz ""mermaid"" 😂😂😂"
0,nice
0,"Skizz brain: if bird, is chicken lmao"

0,all the little corner faces are so cute and helpful! I love them!
0,"grian ""this is the last in the guess the build series"" nah man, this has become a staple. chicken staying white the whole way is because all of you have bias, who's to say a chicken is white now?"
4,Nobody ever let Skizz run a zoo. He has no idea what animals are meant to look like.
0,"It's nice to see that Skizz IS improving. At least with color choices and eye placement. Because last time no one would have guessed giraffe in a million years and here Jimmy was able to guess it correctly, largely due to the color choices"
0,i can’t believe no one’s talking about gems “oh my god” when jimmy said his favorite color is blue
0,"I love the color version of guess the build! I was a little unclear on whether they were trying to get the person at the end to guess the color, or get the color to the end and then have someone else pick the wrong color. But I hope they do more of this in future!"
0,"""For us Americans""? Aren't you Canadian? 😜"
0,30:10 -- SKIZZ! 🤣
1,Ok so homework for Skizz: Watch more Disney movies and go to a zoo lmao this whole thing had me dying of laughter

2,9:56 this is what I’m here for.
536,"I'm giggling because both Gem and Skizz started by saying ""I'm not sure I know what a flamingo looks like"" yet their two interpretations are literally night and day different"

20,"Oh god. Skizz brought back the item frame and ghast tears.

Final guess the build fatigue really set in"
0,"Skizz... I'm not a good builder either, but that flamingo"
1,Joel learning to build the arms from Skizz and then learning to make the aquatic animal sit down from Skizz isn't on my bingo card
0,Skizz's builds are hilarious... but Grian's reactions are priceless!
2,"Whoever gave Skizz that picture book of animals, I'm sorry to say it didnt help."
2,"3:55 GUESS THE BUILD IS OVER? 

NOOOOOOOOOOO"
2716,I need more people to acknowledge impulse's absolute s-tier jack o lantern
0,21:48 I love how he knew
3,9:37 not sure Joel will ever see this comment but some defining features of an owl are that they have the roundest faces and biggest eyes among the birds of prey. Their faces are shaped to be concave like a satellite dish so they can intake as much sound as possible to their offset ears hidden underneath their feathers
2,"We need to start a charity to raise money for skizz to visit a zoo

And also force him to watch the little mermaid movie"
1,no one did a mumbo flamingo

6,"Watching Skizz build that flamingo--I am literally crying 😂 and saying ""no no no, Skizz"""

0,Skizz!  never change!!!
0,skizz’s flamingo has so much emotion in it
0,LOL JOELS WHALE IS SO FUNNY SORRY NOT SORRY
6,"36:00/38:50 I think Skizz needs to be banned from building characters/animals altogether after these monstrosities XD
Truly his worst builds ever/j"
4,21:47 Gem asking Jimmy his favorite color and he says blue * hermitcraft color research flashbacks *
0,These are so funny. I was tearing up.
0,The worst part is that this isn't even the first time Skizz tried to build a flamingo (that ended up going south really quickly)
0,"18:22 Gem just called herself American. Like I know she means North American, but I thought Canadians tended to try to distinguish themselves from USAmericans..."

0,I love chaos 🙃
0,"the fact that Jimmy put the toilet roll on the right ear of the manatee. . .

0,that flamingo looks soooo tired
0,Seeing the Flamingo just makes me think its had an unfortunate head removal and is cleaning up the fluff from it
0,"If I was doing this, I’d say what I see in a sentence, then whatever the subject of the sentence was, that’s the color I’d go with! Everyone seems to have the subject of the sentence as their color!"
0,"It's pretty reasonable that *white* didn't make it through, given that white isn't actually a color.  Anyone guessing the build would be inclined to pick an actual color, so *anything* else in the build was more likely to be guessed."

0,"""a bus is typically yellow"" Impulse knows he's playing with 3 brits, right? lol"

1,Pride months come early chat!
0,35:54 Grians laugh is so infectious XD

0,"Granted, a jack-o-lantern is a pumpkin, but why?  If you see a pumpkin you call it a pumpkin.  If you see a jack-o-lantern what do you call it?  Why not just call it a jack-o-lantern instead of calling it a pumpkin?  

My reasoning:  how do you expect ""jack-o-lantern"" to reach the end of the build(s) if you just call it a pumpkin."
0,question: would it be cheating to write: [*cue beatles music* WE ALL LIVE IN A -- SUBMARINE]
0,"Ok, but that head artwork in the top corner is seriously cute!"

0,"Skizz: I’m so stupid mermaids only have one fin
Meanwhile I couldn’t stop laughing because he made Ariel’s tail orange when he had green in his inventory made her top red and her hair orange 😂😂😂"

2,1:50 ... Joel... cmon man LMAO

0,"I would love to see a coop guess the build, but instead of both building and guessing, Gem, Grian, Joel do the guessing and prompting, while Impulse, Skizz, and Jimmy do the building. So they would pair up where Gem and Skizz, Joel and Impulse, and Grian and Jimmy pair up or some other pairing of master builder and ""novice"" builder pair up. I feel like this could be very fun and hilarious. And they could even add more people to it to have 6 pairings or something. But that could be too many people. Just a random thought I had while watching this video."

1,I wonder if dolphins would stay alive if left in shallow water? Like only 1 block deep? That way they would always be in water and have air available.
0,20:03 GEM!?
0,The return of Sky Zoo!! Have you been playing with Docm?😂
0,GEM DON'T SPAWN THE ELDER GUARDIAN IT GIVES MINING FATIGUE
0,I love your videos so much!!!! :D And thank you for creating subtitles c:
0,"Wow, Gem's about to hit 2mil subscribers!! Thats awesome ❤"
0,"Am I missing something, or wouldn't the Elder Guardian keep giving you mining fatique???"
0,maybe use gates instead of signs on the entrance to the aquarium?
0,14:59 “I have 8 glass and a dream” 😂
0,"Don't feel bad about the dolphins, their AI is incredibly dumb, they'll drown themselves and not try and save themselves"
0,For frogs a mangrove enclosure would work
0,"Gem axolotls can breath air a little so it doesn't actually have to be a fully water enclosure in fact they might like a semi air enclosure better, think lush caves pond. You should have clay and leaves."
1,Oliver where you at 🔥✌️

0,"I play too much minecraft. 
My thoughts at 2:05 : One, Two, Three, Four, Five"
0,"FYI I've seen pufferfiish harm the other mobs with puffed, even though they won't activate because of them, they will activate when you're near.

Also the Elder Guardian is going to give you mining fatigue isn't it?  so that might need to sit *well* away"
0,"If you're trying to use as little glass as possible, you should make glass panes for the windows."
0,No tropical fish?
0,Hey are you can’t put dolphins on leads it stresses them and kills them after a wile also same whith squids
0,I work from home and this is my comfort video for the day as I work on my emails. Thanks Gem!
0,Much more of this plz
0,"its a long shot that youll ever see this comment, but keeping a dolphin in an aquarium in minecraft is an absolute nightmare. the only way ive managed to keep one alive is name tagging it, trapping it in a minecart, and trapping that minecart in a bubble column with a block on top so it doesnt just fly upward. Ive lost DAYS to my dolphin aquarium"
0,5:08 gem please fix the sideways stripped birch log 😭😭
1,HI!!! gem i am by far your biggest fan i love your vids so much i hope to be as good at mineraft as you one day also pls pin me!!
0,So close to 2 mil Gem!!
0,"should also set up a little dripstone farm in the meantime, so when you do get lava you have plenty to spare"
0,a humane way to keep a dolphin alive in minecraft? RIP. inhumane ways? sure
0,what one block is this
0,I'm just amazed you got pointed dripstone in a chest. I had to wait until a wandering trader turned up with it for sale.
2,20:26 it sounded like it said “gemini”
0,Are you going to finish off season 10 of hermit craft
1,GEM PUT THOSE 2 TADPOLES AND SALMON AND COD IN THEIR ENCLOSURES IN THE NEXT EPISODE!!!!! ( sorry if this sounds mean I'm not trying to be mean)
0,30:18 Tequarium
0,"To get the other frog varients, as some commentors suggestioned, you just need tadpoles from any color frog. Sp she cam grow all 4 taddys to frogs there, and if she wants the other colors she can just breed them, scoop up the taddys and bring them to whichever biome she would like. Thays how it works on bedrock anyway."
1,Fun fact: You can name spawn eggs to have the mobs spawn with said name :)
0,"Do you have other bioms in this world if you bridge from your platform?

Is so you could probably get other frog variants from the tadpoles if you wish to."
0,Aww yay zoo time! Love getting to watch it all expand while also learning a ton about the mobs and animals while watching! Keep up the great work Gem and looking forward to more to come! 🥰
0,"My understanding is that mobs that swim stop pathfinding when you’re a certain distance away, so the dolphin just sits there. The problem is that dolphins need air, so they drown because they are no longer pathfinding to find air, so the only real way to keep them alive is to keep them in a bubble column."
1,GEM GEM GEM YOU HAVE 1.99 MILLION SUBS!!!!! SO CLOSE TO 2 MILLION!!!
0,Love this series and it's inspired me to give it a go. Can you tell us which single block mod you're using to play please as there are so many and they're all slightly different.
0,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0,Can someone help a noob out and explain how to get this exact Oneblock map? I'd love to play the one with biomes. I've tried looking it up but I'm either missing something obvious or searching for the wrong stuff bc I haven't figured it out yet lol.
1,"4:51 I WALKED all the way to a snow biome just to get two of those cool cows, and when I put them in the pen. They escaped… I gave up and didn’t go back 😔"
0,Like the polar bear enclosure you should add a palm tree to the turtle enclosure
0,"You should ask etho why you can’t keep dolphins as pets in minecraft 🙈 he had a very nice, but sad, explanation."
0,I'm gonna recommend not spawning the elder guardian until you're sure you won't need to break any more blocks :P
0,"The best way to keep dolphins alive is to keep them in a 1x1x1 bubble column. It doesn’t look humane, but it’s the best thing to keep them alive as they need both water and air to survive, but stop moving when you’re out of render distance and they will either drown or dry out when they stop moving"
0,Snowdrop is so cute
0,"HELLO GEM I’m here to help. You literally can’t keep dolphins alive it’s impossible. 

The reason why is if someone it not in the same chunk as it then it will freeze in spot until a player arrives or the chunk is loaded since the chunk was loaded it’s cause you went in the chunk and it froze and drowned also dolphins like to down/suffocate themselves for no reason

Edit: same thing with Squids I’ve been able tonkeep them but I’m not too sure how well their pathfinding works so sorry gem
HOPE THIS HELPS"
0,can we js talk abt how close gem is to 2M?
0,Gem! For the all water aquariums and you have enough resources you can put lights in them so we can see the animals more
0,Ask Scar how he kept the dolphins alive in his hermit zoo. I think he added some bubble columns so they survived
1,"A tip to “mine” blocks faster. If you put any kind of non-full block, like slabs, two blocks below the one block. Then any gravity based block will break itself without the need to mine it."
0,"Hopefully somebody in Gems wonderful community can answer this question. What version is she playing on my daughter plays on my old Xbox 1 and there are so many versions to choose from.

Thanks yall"
0,I think I've been watching too much Hermitcraft 'cause when that first Guardian spawned I fully thought it'd have to go in the zoo 😅 - This series is so fun and the creativity behind starting from one block and seeing everything expand is so cool.
1,I love this series :D
0,Maybe you could try and grow the other two frogs up elsewhere if there is a different biome nearby? Have different coloured frogs!
0,Commenting for Gem's YouTube algorithm
1,Gem don’t build out of wood when a Ghast spawns in on the next Phase your doomed 😅
1,"Gem, Congrats on 2 Million Subscribers 💓"
0,0:27 my heart dropped i thought she was gonna fall off (im way to used to people playing on hardcore)
0,"I remember one of the guys on Hermitcraft figured out how to keep them alive in a small space for the dolphin highway. It was a single block of soul sand water with a block above it, so it has a pixel of air and still water and is technically in both which it needs."
0,Anybody who watches Dantdm has PTSDD: post-traumatic stress dolphin disorder
0,"Don't know how to keep a dolphin alive, but you did save them (and the squids) from dying right on the platform. You cannot be held responsible for their stupidity. And it does weird things to the vertical surface of the water, but if you get desperate for more glass, 6 blocks will give you 16 panes, and they *will* hold the water in."
0,And now you understand why Scar is serving dolphin burgers! 😄
0,"I'm not sure about the exact layout of the biomes in One Block, but if there are any others than the standard Plains biome you start in, maybe you could put your remaining tadpoles there to get the two other kinds of frogs for some variety!"
0,Hapoy birthday
0,does she play with mods on skyblock?
0,"8:33 In stories, there’s a narrative element known as foreshadowing…"
0,29:34 is that a blue axolotl there super duper rare!!!
0,Minecraft dolphins are simply very bad at staying alive.
0,I know IRL dolphins likes to be a donkey and bully pufferfishes to get high but in return risks overdosing/getting pricked to death by pufferfishes. Not sure if Minecraft follows that mechanic tho
0,"Don't forget that Elder Guardians will give mining fatigue, EVEN THROUGH BLOCKS!
If you keep Eldon the Elder, you NEED to put his enclosure FAR away from everything else."
0,You should try to make a lush cave for the axolotls. That’s their natural habitat
0,"Gem, do NOT spawn in the elder guardian unless it's VERY VERY far away, cuz u'll never be able to mine normally again without milk buckets lol"
0,"I love the way Gem says ""polabear"" instead of ""polar bear"" :)"
0,the one block aquarium makes it’s return but better 😎
0,Chuck the dolphins on a water logged slab surrounded by fences. Or bubble columns.
0,"Is it just me or does Gem drop the R in ""polar"" when saying ""polar bear?"""
0,Didn't you know that fireflies are poisonous to Frogs?
0,I recommend making a backup when you get to the nether stage.
0,You haven't lost a single animal? what about those poor sheep! they died from neglect!
0,30:18    finally frog deserved to has the firefly  since it don't add together in the wild update.
1,4:59 careful the snow doesn’t melt! That could be bad news for the polar bear:(
0,Happy Birthday Gem!! 🎉🎂🥳
3,"Gem, you could have made your life so much easier by just adding a layer of blocks 1 block below the top of the aquarium, making that full water and then breaking the blocks to fill it 😭❤ I know you didn't say anything but why struggle💀❤❤❤ I love your vids so much btw. My ultimate comfort creator❤"
0,"Just a heads up, goats don’t kill sheep in Minecraft wolves and foxes do. I think a fox got into your sheep pen then got out too."
0,28:38 Can confirm :(
0,Yall 10k ppl need to subscribe shes so close to 2 mil i know gem will never see this but if u do and ur not subbed pls subscribe she makes great vids
0,Dolphins suffocate when you are too far away. Ask Scar about it. He's the dolphin expert.
0,"30:18 Just learned this because of another cool youtuber who made one, but technically since the frogs enclosure has both water and air, it would be called a paludarium."
0,Thanks for another skyblock series. I haven't played MC much in the last year or more so it's fun seeing how you handle new mobs and stuff.
0,22:31 Dolphins die if ur more than a certain blocks away because they freeze and then drown.
0,The barn at the front of the zoo shoud be a petting zoo!
0,I’d put the tadpoles in with the turtles
1,Happy birthday geminiTay!!!!!!
0,Gem! I love that this series is coming back I renember watching the first one a while ago :0 could you name one of the frogs tad? In memory of my dead pet frog :)
0,Happy late birthday gem 🎁 here a present!💝
1,"0:30 Oh, my heart sunk. GEM, don't do that! 😂"
0,Can you do a live stream?
0,Gem's zoo being created faster tgan Scars....

0,When are you going to do the series with the snowy village it's been a long time and I like that series.
0,What happened to your hardcore world??? I’ve been waiting for new videos
0,Careful with that Elder Guardian. It will give you Mining Fatigue III constantly....
0,OMG YOU’RE NOW SOOOO CLOSE TO 2 MILLION SUBS🎉🎉🎉🎉
0,Fun episode! Also yeah dolphins suck lol.
0,"nobody cares, and it'll never catch on, and this is apparently pedantic... but axolotl is pronounced ""ash-ah-loatch"""
0,i cant wait for the next episodeee
0,"Also the level of water is important with dolphins, there is a y level where they try to get air and if there is water above that y level then they suffocate, i made an “above sea level” aquarium and they suffocated. I think the last time you had dolphins you kept the “surfacel level at the same as the one block and the pool
part was beneath so they could come up for air."
1,Am i the only one but idk like GEM YOU NEED TO HURRY IN POSTING THE MISADVENTURES VIDEO I AM DYING RN
0,"Hi Gem, I would like to ask you to look up how to correctly say Axolotl from a Nahuatl speaker. It's a common mispronunciation, but it would mean a lot to some people to hear the word said even _approximately_ right. It'd be nice to hear _any_ Minecraft youtuber get it."
0,HAPPY BIRTHDAY GEM!!!!
0,Hi I’m the axolotl trying to escape 😃
0,Please upload regularly 🥺🙏
0,"You might want to go ahead and get the dripstone started it takes a long time for it to grow. Then you'll have more later once you get lava.
If you can raise the tadpoles in hot/cold biomes you might could get all 3 colors. I'm not sure if the 1 block changes to the biomes it's giving blocks from but it might be worth checking."
0,<3
0,GeminSKYTay! woot!
0,I was wondering if i was just crazy lucky getting 2 tridents from drowned before the free one in the final chest
0,You should breed them so you can have an infinite source of fishes
0,"I've been enjoying this series, Gem.  Thanks! 😄"
0,"Haha, I love how she goes from saying terrarium to saying tarrarium by the end of the video 😄"
0,"Hi Gem. Look up how to keep a Dolphin alive in 1 block minecraft.  there is a way to keep then alive. It's a bit of trickery doe to the game's rendering & path finding limitations. You will want to look it up there is 5 things you need to see about it.
If I was friends with you. in FB. I could just send it to you.  But we are not friends that way. Good luck.  I asked how do i keep a Dolphin alive in 1 block minecraft."
0,Love this series!
0,Dolphins die easily because they need air and water so whenever they are out of render they drown
0,"Yayyy, what a great episode! Some of my favourite animals added to the zoo (axolotls and frogs!!!!)"
0,Excellent. Was looking forward to this episode to see how you dealt with the aquatic mobs. I was inspired to play a one block game by you starting this series and have really enjoyed it. Am starting again with some different self enforced rules / objectives that may make it interesting. I'm continually amazed by the quality of your building. Unfortunately for me I don't have a particularly artistic flair but enjoy trying nonetheless.
0,"The only surefire way to keep a dolphin alive (to the best of my knowledge) is to trap it in a bubble column. Sad as it sounds, dolphins are dumb. Their Ai shuts off before they're rendered out, so they continue needing to breath and swim, but can't pathfind to air / water respectively, so they drown. If you get them into a bubble column and trap them in it, they get air and water permanently and can survive forever."
1,Oh no ! the frogs are gonna die because they'll eat the fireflies that are toxic to them ! /s
1,GEMMMMM WHERE WERE YOU- thank you so much for every single video you post
0,31:40 oFISHally
0,"the fun stuff with Dolphin, is that... you can't keep them alive, the moment you put them in an enclosure, they just die cuz their A.I scks... they don't even consider breathing air."
0,"Minecraft dolphins cannot be kept alive without containing them to only be in a bubble column. They will literally drown themselves eventually otherwise, by just not going to the surface to breathe often enough. Just ask Scar, Impulse, or Etho about it."
0,2m countdown 🙉🙈
0,I loveeee when gem starts a single player world
0,"yeah, ive never seen anyone keep a dolphin alive successfully. scar has had like 11 die in this current season of hermitcraft"
0,"28:39 😂😂😂
32:21 air bubbles ✨"
0,20:33 that one almost landed a trickshot LOOOOL
0,Just loved the gameplay ❤ I mean the way you were trying to save each animal is so good 😊 I just love how you play oneblock❤ hoping for more gamplays!!!!!!!😊
0,"Waiting for the next 100 days for this world, please ❤"
1,"If you ever decide to name the frogs, Hop and Bop would be really cute. 😊"
1,HAPPY LATE BDAY GEM!! Hope you had a great weekend with your family❤❤❤
3,"for the dolphins, I'd follow Scar's advice and turn them into burgers :)"
1,Gem did you just destroy the last grass block ... ? 😶😐
28,"If there's a nether phase where magma cubes spawn, maybe consider bringing a frog or 2 across to eat them (you have to battle them down to the small ones) so you can have froglights.

The colour of the froglight depends on what biome the frog grew in."
1,If u render out they stop trying to breath and suffocate
1,Almost 2 million!! Awesome!
1,looks like scar has an influence
2,Maybe it's better to add a farm in the east of the island + it could be an automatic farm too 👍
1,Maybe Scar knows what had happened to the dolphin...
1,why did you stop putting live stream in the corner? it's nice to have a face to relate the voice too!
1,30:52 Use the lava from the stone generator to make your lava farm.
1,hiiii
1,Hehe “wadur”
4,"28:50 You can actually craft leads with 4 string and a slime ball (they actually changed the slime ball to another string in snapshot 25w18a, so it's just 5 string in the new recipe) (but idk what version you're playing on and you're probably not on the snapshot)"
1,Beware of stage no 9 as there are so many bad mobs vex silverfish skeletons on skeleton horses and the warden. The warden borders on impossible because he kills you with the sonic beam and he can smell you at 25 blocks away and he doesnt  despawn :(
0,To keep the dolphin alive you need to make the floor soul sand so theres air in the water thats the only actual way itsr eally dumb
1,"You probably could see if impulse knows anything about dolphins. I think he has some in metro mayhem? I could be wrong. But i want to say he was trying to toy with dolphins grace for part of the race.

I think Scar has killed like 40 of them, though. Lol."
0,It's called a vrereom not terereom
18,I love the way gem said salmon at 29:09
14,0:28 I'm very impressed she didn't fall there😭
1,"Without bubble columns, the only thing I can think of to maybe keep the dolphins alive is to have them dangling with a lead that keeps them partially submerged in shallow water."
1,Love the zoo! Very fun to have different habitats :]
1,You should name one of the frogs Frodrick (frog fredrick)
1,Gem playing zoo tycoon
1,Save the other tadpoles for a different biome to get different coloured frogs c:
1,oh i'm tuned in
286,"Gem, quick suggestion! don’t grow the tadpoles into frogs before expanding the island and raising them in other biomes where they will be different colors and potentially be used to farm different colored frog lights if that’s even possible in this pack. There are three frog variants: orange (from normal swamps), white (from mangrove swamps), and green (from cold biomes). Good luck!"
6,"If you place water top of slabs and then remove the slabs, it'll fill the entire space underneath it with water. I can't believe you manually filled that aquarium up, Gem. You're crazy! Work smart, not hard!"
1,"You should turn your glass into glass panes, that way you'll have a lot more blocks to use"
6,"You're having the same problem Scar had earlier in s10 when he was building the aquarium car on his train where the dolphin ai stops working and they sink to their death. Grian also had issues when he was transporting them on leads over land to his dolphin's grace/depth strider speed highway after seeing etho's speedzone in his base. Scar reached out to Impulse and Tango to get either one of their help to get a redstone mechanism to open bubble columns every once in a while to keep them alive, but i dunno if they managed to do it yet and i dont know if you can get the required redstone stuff. Grian and i think etho as well, stuffed them in one by one bubble column pods to build the speed boost things. So i think maybe Etho or Cub could help if you really want an enclosure like thing cause i think they die with leads on as well. Or Doc"
2,Scar worked out that you need a constant supply of bubbles to keep the dolphins alive.
2,"Hey Gem, maybe you should make a path out to a different biome and put the other two tadpoles there so you can get different color frogs.  Only problem I can see is that you would have to stay there until they grow up because of chunk loading. 😅"
9,"28:40 Fun fact, squids actually have a donut shaped brain, and when they eat food, it goes right through the middle"
1,man I been waiting for this one <3
2,GUARDIAN HAVE TORN?!?!!! SINCE WHEN??!!!
1,Hey you should create a animal log book where you can keep track of how many there are of each and which ones died and which ones didn't you could Even put names for them and details about them you don't have to it's just a suggestion love your vids your awsome❤
3,It would be good if the map at ocean level would give the players a silk pick so you could get the pretty coral. Always get to watch your vids
1,Eeee I am LOVING this series!! The zoo is looking so cuuute 🥰❤️
1,"Hey gem, for the beach in the turtle pen , I think a great idea would be to add a lounging chair and a mini umbrella!"
1,12:09    you've just been     axoloteled
1,"Maybe you could name the cyan axolotl Peekaboo, because it poked its head through the trapdoor at the end!"
1,YAAAYyyyy! Skyblock!
0,You should name one of the frogs Grian 🐸
1,Maybe you could try to get all three frog varieties for the exhibit!
1,"gem, its official... the race to 2 mil....you or bdubs who will win?"
1,"If it's even possible to keep dolphins alive, Scar would be the one to ask."
1,I don't know but I feel like you NEED to name the polar bear Sammy
0,BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!! ❤❤
0,"Dolphins are like squids. They don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. So don't worry about keeping them alive.

Also gem if you want to do a building/getting wood, expanding the island, and general upkeep of the island in a stream. We would probably love that

Also also, when you're able to, try to make sure you build a house around the one block from fire and blast resistant blocks. Especially when you have one bucket of lava. We don't want to have issues when creepers, blazes, and ghast spawn"
0,"ITS A GOOD DAY WHEN I GET TO WATCH GEMINITAY

(Ooh that rhymes)"
0,Ask Scar about keeping dolphins alive.  He has been dealing with that on his train.
0,DON’T ADD THE ELDER GUARDIAN TO THE ZOO IT WILL GIVE YOU MINING FATIGUE
0,"If I had a nickel for each hermitcraft members video I watched today of them making a zoo in minecraft, I'd have two nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird it happened twice."
0,Gem you don't need a nametag for the elder guardian. If you name the spawn egg in an anvil then it will spawn with that name. Also I don't think elder guardians despawn anyway but you can never be too sure
1,Gem is great
0,"Not sure about the dolphin, but the squid definitely died by breaking the lead and then probably instantly despawned. Naming any future squid should keep them alive. Also, your aquarium looks big enough to fish in for loot if you wanted to try to get name tags that way.

No name tag required for the Elder Guardian. So long as you don't switch to Peaceful or kill it, it is a permanent mob."
0,wooohoooo new episode
0,"Gem's videos are so relaxing to watch, keep up with the hard work!  :>"
0,"Gem, what happened to your hardcore series?"
0,"You should name your fox Ruby, I think :3"
0,"The dolphin's AI will turn off if the player is too far away. If the dolphin is loaded but the AI is not loaded, it will drown and die.  Grian found this out in Hermitcraft 9: Episode 34."
0,"You're the second Canuck I've heard add a third 'n' to the word 'infinite'. Maybe it's a weird accenty type thing... makes me wonder how you pronounce 'finite'....

Fun series though. Thanks."
0,I could be wrong but I feel like I heard that dolphins die if they are in too small of an area? Like Mojang was trying to discourage kids from keeping dolphins in captivity or something. 🤦‍♀️
0,"""So far we haven't lost a single animal"" *The sheep that was murdered by goats.* ""Am I a joke to you??"""
0,hey gem do you have a ps2? i have my original Baldurs Gate 1&2 on disk. if you have a po box i could send it to you
0,Dolphins are notorious for not wanting to stay alive. scar has the same problem on hermit craft and I don't know anyone who has successfully kept dolphins lol. I saw a short once that said that dolphins need both air and water but even if you give them access to both if you unload the chunks they stay still and drown regardless?
0,Does anyone know which mod gem uses for the armor to be mostly invisible? All the ones i can find make them transparent not cool accessories 😢
0,Any chance you can number the episodes somewhere? I'm loving this series!
0,"Yep, knew the dolphin wasnt gonna last. Should of asked scar."
6,I love Gem's voice when its so calming and its a change when shes just been screaming at the dads in REPO. Ily Gemmy!!
0,Wait Gem don't grow up the other two frogs yet don't yo want the hot and cold variants of the frogs too?
0,Unless you have soul sand I am not sure.  Maybe if you had the Dolphin trapped inside a 3x3x4 box with a single water source in the middle.  Mainly the water would have to be shallow enough so that the dolphin can still get air and just deep enough to keep it wet.  Also the side of the enclosure would have to be tall enough to keep the dolphin from jumping out.  I will say last time I played this mod I just gave up on keeping the Dolphin.
0,a terrarium with water is often called a paludarium :)  I have froggies IRL
0,frog enclosure goes hard
0,I did not know you can craft snow layers... can you do that on Bedrock?
3,with both pointed dripstone and a dripstone block you can also farm dripstone for a new renewable building block
0,"23:42 its called a paludarium
The word means something like swamp or marsh"

0,Gem is channeling hermitcraft Scar with the zoo
0,The new animal pens and aquariums are really cute! Your zoo is gonna be so lovely with all the different animals!
0,"The dolphins are likely dying because their ai stops at a certain distance while still being rendered making them stop moving so they end up drowning since they're frozen underwater, the best bet will likely be to make a section specifically for the dolphins where the floor is entirely soul sand so they'll constantly be bouncing between the air and water"
0,If only I’d watched this video before going thru the ocean phase. Lost so many mobs 😢
0,I would love to see one of y'all one block content creators to do a version with realistic textures. live stram would be great.
0,"Gem, this series is so cute. I love watching your stuff. I'm new to Minecraft and loving it. ❤"
0,If you want to keep just completely trap them with water with no escape.
0,"""i punched it and it worked"" is truly the geminitay way"
0,Obsessed with the way Gem pronounces polar bear
39,Woah there Gem. Putting fireflies with frogs. You’re gonna make mojang take them away again.
0,Gem what do you mean you’re gonna have elder guardian in the zoo the zoo is tiny it’s gonna kill everything but especially you-
0,oh it looks so good! i’m glad you posted again i love this series :)
1,"I love Minecraft but it makes me so nauseous, any advice?"

0,4:30 I find it absurdly hilarious that the literal polar bear is more well behaved than the goats. 😂
0,YOU'RE ALMOST AT 2 MILLION SUBS!
4,Could have made the aquarium loop around the fighting ring Gem then if you get creepers just break a glass block or maybe stairs that are water logged 😊
0,"Etho had a similar issue, dolphins just don't pathfind to water/air correctly so they end up drowning (suffocating?). Some soul sand blocks should do the trick."
0,Maybe the dolphins sniffed the puffer fish too much lol
0,22:43 Try bubble columns
0,"Ever seen Star trek:the one with the whales? thats my assessment of dolphin holding bays. gotta beam them into the giant tank as the ones who fall, make more buckets when available, and be ready to pick up the fishes with them, transporting to an actual aquarium, while the holding tank is for the dropped mobs to be placed. if sands available again, much more glass eventually would help, because it'd at least give ideas of how they're pathfinding behind the blocks"
0,Who’s the creator for this mod
0,Dolphins and squid are just dumb. I dont understand why Mojang doesnt set the parameters for them to the same as fish/tadpoles/axolotls and stuff.
0,"You don't need a nametag to rename spawn egg animals, I am pretty sure you can just rename the egg in an anvil and it will spawn the mob with that name."
2,7:12 yay the post next to the stairs is fixed... I can rest now.
0,14:16 You know what that means...
0,The only way I've ever seen someone reliably keep a dolphin alive is if it is stuck inside soul sand bubbles
0,"Another awesome episode, im absolutely loving this series only downside is having to wait for the next episode 😆"
237,"13:45 “so far we haven’t lost a single animal” 
The murdered sheep: 👀"
1,What no lilly pads in the frog enclosure?
0,"It's not that a squid can't hit the side of a barn, it's that it can't not hit the side of a barn"
1,the axolotl need air btw
0,Loving this series
0,"Drink water every time she says ""frog"" and you'll be so hydrated by the end of this video. ♡"
1,Let’s goooo I was watching your empires 2 series yesterday but now I’m watching this video now
0,Gem the dolphin AI is really back as they will just suffocate them selves if there not stored in bubble elevators.
2283,"Gem, don't forget you can actually name creatures in buckets and spawn eggs with just an anvil, no name tags required for them"
0,"You win some, you lose some. Those dolphins...smh GG"
226,"Be careful with that elder guardian. It will target and kill other mobs. Plus, if it’s anywhere close to you you will constantly be getting affected by mining fatigue. Since it’s a one block and you need to mine it to move forward that could become a real headache. Also, moving forward into the next phases of the block you might want to consider building an enclosed box around the one block to try and contain any flying mobs that will eventually spawn. Like parrots, bees, and phantoms. You will also have to deal with blazes and ghasts when you reach the nether phase. Best to contain those mobs so they don’t burn down your platform."
0,Great video! :D
0,This series is so fun I can't wait for next episode!!
0,Does anyone know if their is a bedrock mod similar to this oneblock series?
0,Shift right-click to pick up domestic animals!
0,thank you for getting me into hermitcraft :D
79,"You don’t need a name tag for the elder guardian, you can rename the egg itself (once you have an anvil) and the mob will spawn with the nametag"
0,"I'm not trying to hate on ads here, but am wondering if others are seeing way more ads on youtube (generally? idk) too? I got 8 ads on this 30min video, which i feel is a lot more than usual
To end on a good note: absolutely love that you made individual pens this series rather than grouped pens!"
0,Wow Gem this is the MOST prepared you've been for this phase. Impressive.
0,If you are too far from the dolpfin he locks in place and forgets to get air so it dies
0,"Umm... at the time 5:15 seconds look at the barn layer 1 birch logs. One is offset, so I just wanted to point that out."
14,"Yaay, another One Block video to enjoy <3 Thank you for all the effort Gem, we love it :D
Awesome! You used my name suggestion, I'm so happy!!"
13,"I’ve been checking your channel daily for this upload. You’ve encouraged me to restart my own OneBlock world after I lost motivation in my previous world. Just hoping your desert phase gives you copper before the suspicious sand instead of making you break every block before getting a single ore. 🙃

Edit: Never mind, you got copper from the drowned. Lucky!"
0,If possible you should try and get the different color frogs <3
0,Does Gem like Poutine?
0,i think it'd be funny to interpret a frog enclosure as a magma cube farm. also to name one of the cod Grain
0,"Dolphins need enrichment in their lives, you gotta keep an item in the tank for them to play with."
0,i think instead of the signs guarding the aquarium fence gates would’ve helped stop the dolphins/squids escaping! you can open/close as needed
0,FINALLY!! someone puts a pond under the one block to save the ocean mobs!!
0,I dont like Zoos because they are just cruel to animals - even though its just a game
0,"Good choice, not to grow all 4 tadpoles yet. If you can locate a warm and a cold biome somewhere in teh void around you island, you should grow them, in those two biomes.
Then you can get the other two colors.
Alternatively you could one grow in the nether, but that is really tricky as you need to place them there and feed them a full stack of slime before they die to insta grow them."
0,"Unfortunately, squid and dolphins are entropy personified."
7,33:05 🤣🤣 I had the weirdest audio glitch. I couldn't hear anything at this point and I thought it was a bit about how the axolotl was always watching you!! Until it came back mid sentence. Sometimes life just gives you funny unintended moments. Cheers!
0,"dolphins are so annoying, if your too far away from them they just stop moving until they die"
0,How do I keep dolphins alive? Ask Impulse and Scar. Lots of experience between them. Can you name tag them?
0,"I love this series, it has such a nice atmosphere. I could watch this all day."
0,HERE 1.99M
0,HERE BEFORE 2M
0,How about putting a dolphin in thin layer of water? Like not a source block but at the edge when the water is spread
266,"Gem: ""I can't wait to make an aquarium for the Elder Guardian!""
The never-ending mining fatigue: ""bonjour""

Also I don't think you can do much more to stop squids from dying. They have more tentacles than braincells"
0,"Hey Gem, you can name the spawn egg in an anvil and it SHOULD let you spawn those mobs with the name you chose, allowing you to save a name tag!"
0,"Gem, careful with the Elder Guardian
Or rather, dont forget he gives Mining Fatigue."
0,What’s with the British accent sometimes and the Lizzie style *5 hours later*? I love it but I’m so confused 😂
0,"Dolphins breathe air, which they only get from jumping, so they’d suffocate because of the anti-jump walls (even if what other commenters say about the ai turning off isn’t true)."
0,You could build a chunk loader by the aquarium and then that'll fix the issue with the dolphins drowning. Might cause lag though
0,"ah, that is tough, but the whole thing looks great so far.  Hi Gem. 😊"
0,Literally earlier today I made a frog enclosure (pond surrounded by fences). Then remembered frogs could jump. So now it’s frogs on leads tied to underwater fences in my pond.
1,I’m pretty sure the pufferfish killed the dolphin the monster party probably scared the pufferfish into puffing up
1,yay sunday uploads?
6,Should add a Palm tree for the turtle pen!
0,"Gem, the frog enclosure would be a paludarium since its semi-aquatic."
0,Build a Gazebo type structure over the one block before the Nether. Something that will contain the blazes and Ghasts which will spawn.
690,"Important note for the future: When you get to the Deep Dark phase, remember to take into account that the Warden can hear and will attack any mob that's close enough to it, so it might be a good idea to surround the One Block with wool when you reach that phase."
1,"Love this serie, looking forward to the next episode. Whit out knowing it, I would't put the pufferfish with the dolfin"
0,you sould make a grave yard of all the dead animal:3
0,Maybe ask Scar about keeping Dolphins alive? He has a zoo on hermit craft.
1,noooooo im 3 hours lateeeee
22,"Lots of people mentioned Dolphin ai turning off at a distance and drowning them, but I have also seen stuff about dolphins chasing items in the water and if they get locked on to the item but cannot reach it they will just stay underwater trying to get to it until they drown."
2,"If you want villagers sooner, you could set up a mob farm and convert a zombie villager into a villager so you can get things like name tags.

I think you should probably also be able to get name tags by fishing as well."
0,"Gem: ""Why did my dolphin die?""

Scar: ""First Time?"""
0,23:45 FROGGG HOUSEEE
0,"For the frogs, see if you can grow the other two tadpoles in a different biome."
1,"unrelated to the dolphin extinction and i don’t know if this would be something worth considering but to make the falling into the void aspect safer you could add water in different places to flow down as you expand the island, just so you can catch yourself in case you should fall (not that i think you will)"
0,maybe give the aoloteles some air space or some land area they might like it
0,Are dolphins not capable of despawning ??? I thought they could despawn
0,"Great Video Gem, I couldn't help but laugh though about the Dolphins & Squid 😅"
0,IM EARLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
0,question:  isn't snow carpet melt on rain? and you can try raising the 2 extra tadpoles in a different biome for different color
0,"Apologies for the double comment (I usually don't)
31:17 I think its worth mentioning.. Elder Guardians give mining fatigue.. try not to place it until its far enough away that it wont effect you if you to make an exhibit."
455,"I love this series!!!  One tip, if you want to keep the Elder Guardian, don't forget to put it FAR away because it will constantly give you mining fatigue which would probably be annoying."
0,You can fish for name tags.
0,"Fun fact! A combination terrarium and aquarium is called a paludarium :D if you're interested in seeing an irl one built I'd suggest the channel tanks for nothin. He put moss frogs in his paludarium :>
I also suggest, Gem, you could possibly take your other 2 tadpoles into the other biomes in the world to get the different colours. Obviously that would require a lot of bridging and looking for the correct biomes but it would be cool"
0,Doesnt mangroove propagule require water beside it for it to grow ?
0,You should look for different biomes by bridging before you grow the other frogs! See if you can get different colored ones that way!
0,"16:44 Gem sees fish.. grabs out the soap.

Who knows what this is a reference to?"
0,"Don't forget that when you make the elder guardian farm, it needs to be at least 50 blocks away from your one block..."
0,Dolphins are weird because they need water and air to survive but sometimes they don’t always go up for air then they die
0,I thought axolotls breathe air?
0,"You can talk to Scar about dolphins, the reason he  made them into burgers."
0,Yess one block I've been so waiting to watch episode 3!!!
0,"In order for the dolphins to live, you would have to have a bubble chamber to get them to move up for air since they'll stop moving when you're away..I believe.. as for squid? They're hopeless."
652,"A semi-aquatic vivarium (general word for aquariums, terrariums etc), like the one you made for your frogs, is called a Paludarium.
The Palu- comes from a Latin word meaning 'swamp' or 'marsh', so a paludarium is the perfect name for the cute little home for your frog friends! 🐸"
0,GURL U HAVE ALMOST 2 MILL 🥳🥳🥳🥳😁😁😁❤❤❤
0,You could use glass pains to make your glass go a little bit further
0,Dolphins are hard to keep. Ask Grian.
0,HOW DARE THE ALGORITHM HIDE THIS FROM ME FOR TWO WHOLE HOURS
0,Gemmmm
1,Ask Scar about dolphins
0,"Fun fact, if it has both aquatic and terrestrial elements, it's called a paludarium 😊"
0,"was waiting for this video since a long time , ty for posting gem :)"
0,"If it's got critters, its a vivarium. Yay for pedantics! ❤"
0,U know sometimes if i'm busy i just play ur videos im the background and just keep up with my assignments.. luv u be safe out there 💗💗
0,Domain Expansion: Frog Enclosure
0,"The Elder Guardian sounds like a great addition to the zoo, but the mining fatigue within a 50 block radius would probably become extremely tiresome pretty quickly"
2,"Y'know, I should've figured the squids would perish. They have this odd bug where they tend to beach themselves."
19,32:31 You have a murderous puffer....
1,"You could also make a small dripstone farm to make more pointed dripstone which could use to make dripstone blocks as another building material (pretty much a infinite block source in a way) :)

Also you can name animals while they’re in buckets so you don’t need nametags to name axolotls, fish, or tadpoles"
0,Looks like Scar has some competition!! 😂
0,Puffer fish killing your dolphin
0,Tortles! I love tortles! :ô: They are so cute \(>w<)/
0,"Yay a new video on my birthday!
Best gift ever GeminiTay"
0,We should name the axolotl binky
33,"To prevent a dolphin from suffocating before you have access to soul sand, use a lead on a high enough fence post so that the dolphin is bouncing in and out of the water."
0,"The only reliable method to keep a dolphin alive is trapping it in soul sand bubbled water so it will always have both air and water and won’t move, an enclosure with a roof and fully soul sanded water will work too"
0,"..... better not get the elder guardian before the end of the series, the last thing you want in oneblock is miningfatigue"
1,Gemmm
81,Thanks for saving the frogs. That is 1 nice looking frogarium.
65,"Goes without saying, when you do make the Elder Guardian exhibit, put it very, very far away from the main area. Unless you want a fresh dosage of mining fatigue"
0,17:01 just ask. Lol 😂
0,"I literally tried seeing if you had posted exactly this series two hours ago, and then you posted it an hour later… aboo👎 yt hid this from me"
0,"Years ago I had a single player world where I tried to keep dolphins alive without using bubble colums. Since then, I've seen many creators and posts involving dolphins in-game, which lead me to still have not seen a realiable way of keeping dolphins alive without using bubble colums."
0,"Could you use glass panes?
Did gem discover it?
I mean it might look a little bad but?"
0,The only way to keep a dolphin alive is with 100% soul sand bottom and full water blocks sealed with a lid with no air. You couldn’t have kept them alive with the supplies you had.
1,I just finished watching ep 2! What amazing timing!
0,Almost 2 million!
1340,"A possibly important fact for later in the series: dirt can become a renewable resource once you get lava and moss. Lava and water make stone, moss can spread to the stone, growing a large spruce tree converts the moss to podzol, you now have dirt."
0,love this series <3
0,Those goats aren't goated.
7,It’s honestly a joy to watch her work. She’s so upbeat and makes the game so much fun.
0,"U could put dolphins in the circle u made around that ""1 block"" so they swim around you while u mine that one block"
0,"Pro tip: You cannot keep a dolphin alive in any way. They have ridiculously bad and frustrating AI, allowing them to not even care about going up to the surface to breathe, no matter if it’s in captivity or in the wild. Actually there is a way, and it’s to put the dolphin in a 1-block pool, which is not very aesthetically pleasing but it’s the only way."
0,Do you have different biomes for the frogs?
0,A mixed land/water vivarium is called a paludarium :)
0,I love the new zoo enclosures!
0,"Maybe let the tadpoles grow in another biome, so they are a different colour :)"
0,Can't build a zoo cuz scar dun it
0,"heads up, elder guardian curses you."
5,"For the axolotls you could build some pink stairs or a lawn chair, you know - if they're supposed to be there. 🐧"
0,"You said ""I don't know if Squids despawn"" and I replied out loud ""IDK either, I just know they're terminally dumb and like to suffocate themselves"" lol"
12,Scientists say that octopi are really smart. They never say that about squid.
0,"I don't see a comment yet, won't the elder guardian give mining fatigue?"
0,Great episode
1,Love these series! You're amazing Gem!
0,i am pleased to discover that Gem pronounces god and cod very similarly. we need a cod god
2,"I've been enjoying this series!! The zoo is looking good, and I'm glad you were able to build some cute enclosures for the mobs that don't play well with others. 😅

Also, aquatic mob AI is so bad in Minecraft, and I don't think there's a lot that can be done for it with the limited resources available in Skyblock.

I started playing this after the last episode and my squids and dolphins also didn't want to live. I also played the previous version of this datapack, so I definitely tried to plan ahead. I had a solid rectangular pool to reduce the amount of corners they could suffocate in, but dolphins forget to breathe even when the chunks are constantly loaded. No idea what happened to the squids, but they're gone, too. It's kinda reassuring to know that it probably would have happened even if I also tried using leads."
0,Dolphins are just nearly impossible to keep alive
1,"24:06 bUt gEmINiTAy, fIReFliEs pOiSoN FRogs"
0,This series is so satisfying and I find the updates right when I'm about to do something I hate. Dishes.
396,You should wait to let the other tadpoles grow and do it in a cold and warm biomes so you can get all the variants.
0,Fun fact. The enclosure for frogs is paludarium.
0,dolphins and squids are basically impossible to keep alive lol!
2,29:09 sammin' :D
0,your zoo needs all types of frogs - which spawn in different biomes. You could have an enclosure for each type!
0,Dolphins lose their AI when you're not close by (I think it's like 16 blocks or something like that). The only way to keep them alive is to stay close by or use bubble blocks. Scar had the same issue with his zoo and Grian had the same issue with the sesason 9 dolphin highway.
0,"The dolphins are dumb and if they are not loaded in the chunk, they basically suffocate, so you need to have sould sand in the water, to make sure they have water and air at sll times"
0,"I guess the dolphins get stuck in blocks of the roundish aquarium you built and then can't swim up and die of suffocation? 
Maybe a 20 by 20 flat cube area might work? Might be even better to have a larger area for them. I usually test things out in creative to see if it works first."
0,Hermitcraft?
0,Yay more of this series :)
2,"Im so glad that i got introduced to the hermits (i am still a base level fan aka i binge watched the life series and am only subbed to Grian,Scar,Gem,Joel,Mumbo)"
2,"Omg what a day, first new hermitcraft episode from scar followed with joel and now a gem video! Im being spoiled"
0,I love your content gem
0,Alomost 2m Lets go
3,Now THIS brings me back
1,I love this series! ❤
0,Dolphin’s are impossible to keep alive in Minecraft 😅
0,Name tag them! 😊
0,"The only was to keep dolphins alive is to put it into a bubble column.

They need water and air but the AI is kinda broken so you need both in one block."
0,♥️♥️♥️
1,"22:24 Gem dolphin ai js sucks, unfortunatelly when you get a certain distance away from them they start not moving anymore, and because they also need to go out the water to survive, yep, thats right, they die. Only thing you could do so they last a little bit longer is to put soulsand so the bubbles of it keep them alive for some time, but even tho, no garantee :("
349,"22:25 Dolphin ai is pretty flawed. When you’re far enough away from any Minecraft mob, it will stop moving. With fish and squids, this is fine because they don’t need air. With dolphins, this causes them to drown as they cannot resurface for more air…
Basically the only surefire way to keep a dolphin alive in captivity is to put it on soul sand bubbles. This major flaw has existed ever since the dolphins were added and hasn’t been fixed"
1,The problem with the dolphins is the stop moving when you are not nearby.  So they die by drowning.
0,"Soul sand at the entrance, also I think bubble coeloms help them breathe, also it makes for a good exit."
23,"Gem, you should grow your tadpoles in different biomes to get different colors. Once grown you can put them with the others."
0,:D
0,Pls do more episodessssssssssssssss
1,YESSSS I LOVE THIS
0,you could have saved on the glass if you had made pains for the small window sections :) 16 pains from 6 glass blocks.
0,❤❤❤
0,you should probably just rename the egg instead of looking for a name tag
1,Please make a new life series again pls pls pls
16,"Hey gem! With the dolphins, when you despawn the water, the dolphins stay spawned and don't have water to breathe! Their AI also likes to get them stuck in walls 😔"
0,"After watching this, it's confirmed, Gem can do anything lol"
389,The only way too keep dolphins alive is with soul sand. When the chunks aren't loaded they suffacate because of a lack of air/water while a bubble column supplies both.
0,the dolphin is like the bee.. they are in the world to off themselves XD more then likely it suffocated itself in the wall . sorry for your loss XD
0,"27:48 YouTube series > twitch streams for sure for sure, all day everyday"
16,How you keep it alive I think is it Needs food but there was food in there idk? 22:45

2640,"22:20 okay gem, grian had an issue with dolphins in s9 of hermitcraft on his water highway. I read in a comment once that dolphins are stupid. If you are far enough away, their AI turns off and if left long enough, they either die due to lack of air/water depending on where they were last.

Note: I am not sure if this is true, but grian solved it by sticking it in a soul sand bubble column so yeah, good luck!"

0,yay!!
103,"22:38 dolphins are really finicky and they will die if you aren’t staring at them. They don’t have ai loaded if you go too far but the dolphin is still loaded, so they either suffocate or drown"
1,Hey have you heard of flashback? Its a new mod that does the same thing as replay mod but better and it's created by the people who made axiom so it's that kind of UI and stuff. Just wanted to inform you because I saw that you use replay mod and flashback is a big upgrade from my experience. ❤
0,Can you please please make a ep every Sunday i love your videos
7,i've never really been interested in skyblock but your skyblock vids are making me want to give it a go :)

1,Hi😊
2249,"To my knowledge there is no way to keep the dolphins alive because their pathfinding turns off before they stop being rendered, which means they drown unable to move to the air right above them
Edit: Thank you everyone for pointing out bubble columns, I do believe those might kill the other creatures in the tank, and even if it didn't Gem doesn't have soul sand."

To be exact: Bonemealing running water to make sea grass will turn the running water into a source block."
0,Not me over here watching this and yelling at you that you have leads which you can use to move the goat or to move that arctic fox. You did remember it later though.
0,GEM!!!!! WILDFLOWERS ARE RENEWABLE TOOO!!!!!!!
1,"ᰔ 🐐ABOUT GOATS: 🐐ᰔ

FOOD: Wheat

SPECIAL ABILITY: VERY HIGH jumping (can jump over fences and high walls) 

PERSONALITY: Naughty 

COOL FACT: In Minecraft, goats typically spawn with two horns, but they can lose one or both horns by ramming into specific solid blocks (such as stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, logs, or packed ice), which causes them to drop a goat horn. A goat with only one horn is therefore one that has already rammed a block and dropped one of its two horns but still retains the other. Below, I address the probability and mechanics of encountering a one-horned goat in the game, based on available information."
1,"Sheep: gives Gem death stare 💀👀

0,"I really love her Bass. Really cute and home like. But there's a problem. Everything is wood. And wood is flammable to anything fire related like gast, blaze, and magma slimes which have a chance to cause there currently landing area aflame. Maybe make a stone grinding and make the center area a literal stone box. Add some decorations like glow berrys vines and some leaves to maybe make it look pretty. But please make it nonflammable please please please."
1,Name the wolf .... wolfy
0,What if you do more levels or steps upwards and build like an inverted piramid por the island?? I think that would be pretty cool 🩷
0,"FYI for future playthroughs: you can make infinite water with 1 water source and 1 bonemeal (and two buckets of course), so you didn't really need to wait for the one block to give you a second water source.

Put the water above another block in a way that it flows vertically downwards - you'll have a water source, and then flowing water 1 block beneath it, and then a solid block. Bonemeal the solid block with the flowing water on it. That'll turn the flowing water into a water source. Now you can bucket up both water sources and turn that into infinite water!"
0,You should name the dog Apollo!
0,Currently fighting for my life through a levels and these videos genuinely bring me so much comfort in this craaazzzy time

0,please name the dog lucki! (its my dogs name)
0,ALMOST TWO MILLION?!?!? this feels UNREAL
0,Gem! You should go through with your idea of making the arena out of tough blocks more quickly then you think because Nether will be a phase within the next couple phases most likely and saying as your entire Island is made out of wood it would be very FLAMMABLE to blazes..
0,"5:15 I mean... it's definitely the shape of *some* thing. Lol Gems so pure n sweet she doesnt see stuff like therest of us dregs 🤣. Stay classy, Gem. 💎"

0,"""What happened to my sheep???""

Suspiciously one-horned goat: ""🤷‍♀️"""
0,"Hey wanted to mention that if you are waiting to get another water bucket for an infinite water, you can also do so with one water, dirt, and bonemeal. Basically you start by making a 2 deep hole in the shape of your keyboard arrow keys with one block per key. Then you fill 1 layer with dirt so that it is a arrow keys hole with dirt as the floor. Then you place a block adjacent to the hole but one up right above the middle block or what would be the down arrow key. Then you place water on this block so it is one above the middle block aka one above what would be the down key. Then you bonemeal the dirt collect the water you placed, and if you should have another water source in your hole."
0,"You should name the dog ""Mr. Fluffy but"""
0,"Love the barn. also, I really like the new (grey) chickens because I have a couple of black silkies which look a bit like them"
0,not sure if you already knew this trick but if you put a 2x2 spruce tree on moss (already renewable with bonemeal and a cobblegen) it can be used for infinite dirt because it turns the moss into podzol!
0,"Gem, maybe when you get more materials in your one block series. Try taking inspiration from your past smp buildings like: Empires(both seasons) and Hermitcraft etc.  and incorporating it into one of your future builds:D"

1,Does anyone know what map this is and is it on bedrock?
0,Nilla sounds like such a fun doggie name!!
0,"Dark Oak is my favourite wood type, but it also irritates me to an unreasonable degree. Why? 

Because the outer dark is significantly less saturated than the actual wood. Trying to build in a warm colour palette means that I can't use regular Dark Oak Wood... I have to use Spruce, because Spruces' outer bark is the same colour as Dark Oaks inner wood. And it annoys me. 

Now, why am I commenting this on this video? Because while watching Gem build the barn, I just kept thinking about how those being same colour would look really nice. But they're NOT."
0,"6:30 ""the old skyblock trick with coarse dirt"" makes me feel so so old. Last time I played skyblock coarse dirt wasn't even a thing. First time I played skyblock *hunger wasn't a thing*. I suddenly need orthopetic help for my lower back pain that started right now. Make way for the elderly."

3,I havent watched much minecraft in the past few years but I remember watching the original one block skyblock series and playing it for myself. Im excited its back because ive recently gotten back into minecraft.
1,"One of the things i dont understand when people do skyblock or one block
Whenever they expand, they turn wood to slabs, but always expand from the top half of a block, rather then the bottom half, which prevents hostile mobs from spawning
Ive seen one person do that, and no one else"
1,"I love wholesome chill vibes videos while I'm doing stuff in Warcraft or Ark. But equally so I love sassy zero chill vibes of the GIGGS streams <3 Keep up the amazing work, Gem! Thanks for being my Go-to background content this semester! Cheers to the inevitable 2mil!"

0,Freshly cut oak wood has a density of about 950 to 1100 kg/m³. And a block in minecraft is in comparison to the real world 1m³. So you chopped MORE than a ton of wood. 😂
0,"There is actually a way to generate dirt. U take moss blacks and grow a 2x2 spruce tree with bonemeal. It transforms the moss into podzol, which then u can farm for dirt and replace with new moss  

Tideous for sure, but technically infinite dirt"
0,"5:09 yeah, made me spit my coffee out giggling."

0,"I started this and... oh boy.. it's a one block zoo at the moment... too many animals.. I don't want to keep them alive :) just a pair of each is enough thanks... Why do I need 10 horses... in...skyblock... why? :)  I got the goat bumping my sheep off the island, the fox just killing every chicken and the wolf killing foxes and sheeps, lol.. It's a mess.

Just a thought"
0,"goats are murderous, they have a tendency to ram things within 7 blocks of them"
0,Day 2 of asking to bring the webcam back... just like the old skyblock... having webcam
0,"Gem: *puts goat in the sheep pen*
Me: *chuckles* they’re in danger"
1,Goats attack other mobs. They attack by ramming into them. You can create a farm that can harvest their horns by taking advantage of them ramming other animals.
0,You should name your dog Clarence!!
0,"gem one of the best creators!! im inspired lol!!

Edit: i did not realize pigs followed potatoes. i have also been playing this game for abt ten years and i have indeed learned something new"

1,That dog looks like a Rufus

0,gems in her winter arc 💀 those who know 💀💯💯>>>>>>
3,"I love keeping the spawned animals alive because it feels like a fun Pokemon style ""gotta catch them all"" type challenge. Plus it can add extra building opportunities since all the critters will need new homes!!"
0,"Can you name your dog, Sushi?"
5,I can't imagine how time flies so fast. I was watching gem way back during her hardcore series 4 years ago and now I am in my 1st year of college. I really love watching your series gem!

0,That second fox is 100% dead. If it didn't run off the platform the wolf would have killed it
0,"Can't wait for another relaxing one block video, Gem! ❤️"
0,"I was actually gonna comment when I saw you put the sheep and goats together that goats are SOCIOPATHS but I figured to wait and see if you mentioned it. 

They can kill pretty much any mob that isn’t being regenerated in some way. They killed my horse and two of my frongs before I became aware of their torturous ways. They ram any nearby mob every so often (like once every 3 ish minutes) doing damage slowly"
0,i really like youre episodes but can you pls play yes steve model pls
0,Seeing this posted just made my night! Thank you for the quick turnaround Gem!! ❤

0,9:26 that one birch is gonna bother some of us
117,17:35 - Goats will charge other mobs and the charge does cause damage - Keep half an eye on your sheep!
0,"Hey Gem, I know you would love to get to 2 million, and I think its incredible you are so close, but you don't need that many to be awesome. I subbed when you had less than 100k and saw you grow. The first Empires season was incredible. I think you're incredible. Even if you only had 7k subs I would still watch your videos. So entertaining"
0,I'll throw the names Sky and Courage into the suggestion for what to call the dog.
1,5:10 barn shape very sus! 😂
0,"Name suggestion: Scratch, because bg3! the best boy for the best oneblock!"
0,"I've never watched any One Block before, so I am following this with keen interest!  I don't know how the rules for spawning work here, so I'm not sure how concerned to be about all that grass in the barn.  I had arctic foxes spawning in my grove base All The Time in my last world, until I finally gave up and removed all the snow, grass, and dirt variants."
1,"i love the zoo concept, its like a noes arc, or a spaceship with earth nature in it! i play my one block this way too :)"
0,Aaaah what a lovely video.
0,get goat horns please!
0,missed this series ❤
0,Don't forget to prepare for the aquatic animals!
0,"Should name the wolf ""Bunker"" because ""Safespace"" is a silly name for a dog."
0,The Ruthless Roofless Cyclops Barn
1,Gem the goats ram all your sheeps😢
1,"Every time one of these videos ends I'm always shocked that it's over. They're just so fun to watch that I don't realize it's already been 30 minutes.

Also yay, you're keeping all the animals! That's honestly what I'd spend my time doing if I played this map."
0,Hey Gem? Are you going to try to be proactive and do a little prep for the next stages of building? Like a pond/lake for the aquatic stuff and trying to prep for the eventual villagers etc.
1,"Minecraft is 3d art, starting from one block makes the mechanics of the game the paintbrush; We get to see the combination of Gem's artistry in the foundations of Minecraft through the lens of her artistry in video making, I love this series!"
3,Dag name!! Name her Gourdie!! I remember how much you loved the pumpkin for decorations and naming dogs from things you love is always a great way to ensure happiness<3<3
0,Does anyone know of a proper One Block like this for Bedrock?
0,5:10 “Barn Shape”

0,"I'm actually going somewhere today, but fiiiiirst! Let's watch Gem's playthrough 🥳"
0,"oh i absolutely love when you keep all the animals. After i realized the last season was done i got hungry for more skyblock, and i was horrified when they let all the bunnies and foxes just go and die xD"
0,Love how she's quirky and enthusiastic
0,Yaaaay! Early again! 💛
11,Please think about naming the dog Pebble <3.
6,"14:58 theres a bit of a transcription error thats confusing here- for others who need them, she says ""roofless"" not ""ruthless"" i think"
0,"The EPIC brainrot is strong today. Gem said ""roofless"" and my brain immediately turned it into Rooflessness"
1,"Wouldn't it be useful to build your slab floor a half block up, so that everything is at an .5 height and no mobs can naturally spawn on them? Saves the trouble of lighting everything. 
I'm mainly asking because while I know it works, or at least it still did last time I played, there are a million interactions in Minecraft, so maybe you lose something else in the tradeoff? Just curious."
0,"You could name the dog Achilles, since you plan on doing a gladiator arena design around the one block, and he came from the one block. Also, saying 'Achilles, heel,' would be funny. Amazing content btw ^^"
0,"Consider naming the dog Pebble, please <3"
19,U nailed it fr 🔥
0,You should name the fox slushy!!! or the wolf
0,William the wolf!!!!
1,Gem is great

0,i loved the book adaptation of this!

0,Jared for a dog name don't know why he just gives that vibe
0,You're adorable
1,Just a question but can’t you make more torches out of charcoal?
0,"5:09
Please tell me Gem fixed the roof"
0,rip sheep
1,What I realized that was really cool to me was that you can use one bottle of water to get unlimited water. For future reference: with a cauldron you can use a bottle of water on it 3 times to get a whole bucket of water. Hehe
0,Commenting for Gem's YouTube algorithm
0,"As soon as Gem let the goat stay with the sheep, i knew right away they will headbutt all the sheep 😢"
0,Delilah for the dog go name :)
0,Rabbits are attracted to and can be breeded with dandelions. I just know this because i watch a lot of Pixlriffs streams and he plays bingo from time to time
0,"Amazing video! Quick question, gem are you still continuing the hardcore series?"
0,"You have brand back skyblock, now I wanna see you bring back hypixel build battle :)"
0,I’d hit the sub button but it appears I already have.
0,Blitz? For the dog? 🤔 it was the first thing that popped in my head. 😂
0,5:16 anyone else seeing what I’m seeing 😂
1,21:00 Sisi is a cute name
1,Yay!!! 🎉 new upload!
0,You have to name the fox sky!
0,Gem you should name the doggie Aspen!! It’s a winter name and it suits him/her in my opinion since you got them in the winter one block!
0,My brother LOVES one block so I’m using this series as an excuse to watch gem with him
0,I found you through you old one block sky block series and I have rewatched it so many times so this new series makes me so happy!!
0,love that this series is back! look forward to each episode ❤
0,"If/when you make the bunny meadow, you could incorporate the firefly bushes into the design!"
0,"The flowers and bunnies thing applies solely to dandelions!

0,OMG yass
0,"Am I the only one seeing the asymetric roof? It's even in the tumbnail 😅 There is a slap where an upsidedown staircase needs to be, front and back side🙃"
0,"25:03 Goats will attack players aswel as mobs if they stand still for to long. This is what most likely happend to the sheep, also proven by the fact that their is a goat missing one horn."
0,24:43 goats will ram any mob or player they are around after three minutes if I remember correctly.
1,"Gem, I find it funny that you went to the trouble of getting the leads, then immediately went back to using wheat to lure animals"
0,"i like that the rabbits folllow dandelions, as that's much much healthier for them than carrots"

0,Cabin Core <3 she did it!
0,badger
1,9:27 will haunt me forever. That one block...
0,Can I have a 1 block world in pocket edition? I’m so obsessed with this series and I want to try it myself too
0,Hey gem just started watching the series and im loving it its very relxing during exams but the whole vid one of the oak pillars in the central arena was missing!!!
0,Goats hit any mob who stand still for a minute that is why there was death chikens

0,"9:55 it's not called a *jail,* it's a *hutch.*"
0,the new dog should be steve
1,Doggy name: Atlas......you are after all on a floating platform on top of the world
1,I love the approach to keep all the animals alive.
0,To get more coal just smelt oak logs
2,Fun fact if you make a stone wall and let the goats charge at you you will get a goat horn
0,"Hi Gem, I would make a big cobble cage around the oneblock with cobble walls aswell. It'll be very helpful for when you get to the nether stage bc blaze spawn n stuff"
0,I love this series ❤
0,"We got prox chat, what we planning 👀👀"
0,The reason your sheep sadly died is cuz goats ram into mobs that stand still for too long damaging them. Also cuz of the whole fox fiasco you had throughout the video you should name your dog Copper after the dog from fox and the hound cuz it's cute :D
0,Gem you’re making me anxious 😭 pls built another protection thingy around the block 😭😭
0,11:13  when gem said “in theory” did it activate anyone else’s siri or was that just me 😭😭
1,"Also, you can surround the one block with a 3 block deep pit so if monsters spawn you can just kill them from above or knock them into the pit. When you get some upgrades you can add hoppers at the bottom to collect loot


Edit: I modified and know the pit should be really deep and there is a skinnier platform surrounding the one block(also there is a block or slab under the one block itself and a staircase leading to the skinnier floating platform for easy access) so you can easily collect what the one block gives you without it falling into the pit and just knock any mobs that spawn on the one block into the pit and just keep hitting them form above"
0,dog name jim
1,'One bark' for the dog? like one block? is that silly?
0,"Oh... Wait, so if one of your sheep was killed by a goat, does that mean you won't be able to get any more?"
0,Name the dog Dennis
1,Pretty sure you can craft granite! Search the Minecraft wiki
2,"When i first saw your channel you  were starting a one block series as well .. and it was a really calm experience watching u just building around ...   it really helped my anxiety back then and now u r just my fav mc gamer at all times 
I luv u .. be safe ❤"
4,26:17 they didn’t update one block in this way! It’s a new feature in 1.21.5!
2,"Hi gem, loving the series so far! You could add fences around the one block to prevent mobs from escaping, then you could transport them a lot easier. It would also make monster raids super easy!"
0,Omg the way I was screaming about how the goats were going to charge the other animals...poor sheep and chickens😢 Hopefully more will spawn.
52,"Maybe Snowdrop would be a cute name for the dog! Snow, because it's from the snowy biome and drop, because it dropped out of nowhere really. And mostly because it's an adorable name <3

Also, I'm so happy that you're making this series, it's really cozy and relaxing to watch. Thank you for all the effort Gem ❤"
0,"17:08 Docm77 in sky block after all, despite him not wanting to!"
0,YES! more one block!
0,What that armor resource pack?
1,Is there a mod like this in bedrock
0,"goats randomly charge nearby animals, that’s probably how the chicken and sheep died"
1,I’ve lowkey had two really shitty days this video comes at the perfect time :). Thank you gem 💞
0,how about arfur dug. for the dog?
0,Gem be careful with the goat in the sheep pen! I had my goat with all my animals and it killed all of them by ramming into them- it might kill your sheep- the only animal I have left on my island is my dog and my cold chickens
0,"considering this is technically skyblock, the obvious name for the dog is Air Bud :)"
0,"Which one block are you playing, I've tried one, inspired by you, and it was rubbish compared to yours i know java v bedrock would be different, so suggestions from anyone would be welcome. I don't want to keep buying them until i find a good one. Thanks in advance."
1,Dog name suggestion: Sabrina
0,"I swear if I ever find a Time Machine I’m going back and finding a way to get married to Gem. She’s such a wholesome and inspiring person that never ceases to draw you in. I haven’t heard about your college in a while, but I was also dealing with stuff myself.

Love that you’re still doing these sky builds. They’re my favorites ♥️"
0,I can't be the only one who noticed the stripped log that got placed wrong and never fixed 😢
0,"I've really been loving this series so far, it's really cool to see what you're doing with all the random things you're given from the block!! Very fun to watch!"
0,i love that you're coming back to this series! i just recently rewatched your regular skyblock series and it inspired me to start my own skyblock world :D
0,The dogos name should be Charles
0,"you should create another island that is a zoo
edit 1: and a farm island and an island for each porductivity, but that might just be my adhd brain
edit 2: u prolly already know this but foxes can jump 3-4 blocks
edit 3: rabbits can jump 2 blocks
edit 4: goats jump 10, frogs jump 8"
0,"Scooter for the dog
Idk, I just think it suits him"
1,GEM THE STRIPPED BURCH 9:27
0,The goats ram entities that stand still for to long
1,I always name my first dog in Minecraft Ozzy Pawsbourne
0,The goats must’ve rammed and accidentally killed the sheep and the Chicken! Thats why they died😓
0,Goats are such menaces.. they ram anything that stands still.. I found that out when they killed my bear 
0,Pupper name suggestion: Zephyr
0,"With the goats be careful of the YEET! They will slam you off to the moon, it killed me more then once and in skyblock it seems like certain doom."
0,"Here are some name suugestions for your dog.  

Penelope, Atlas, Diana, Max and Chase.

I hope this gave you some good ideas and I love your videos❤"

0,just to clerafi the kiling of sheep and all the dead mobs was raming gots gem i highly recomnd separting the goats form the  rest of the mobs also this was a great vidoe love your content cant wait for the next one :  )
82,"Now that you have infinite water, you can make a big enough pool to prep for the aquatic stage (plus can fishing rod for things, albeit the string being a rare resource). Us commenters also always mention mob farms, but even an inefficient, temporary one one might be worth the effort, just to get things like string, spider eyes, bones, etc."
0,i m poupinh
0,"Thank You So Much for the video, Gem. Can't wait for the next one"
0,NAME THE DOG EMMANUEL
0,"Goats need to be separated from ALL OTHER MOBS. Every 30 seconds to 5 minutes it will attempt to ram a non-moving entity that isn't a ghast or other goat. This ram if it hits will do between 1 and 3 damage. Screaming goats (you don't have any at this time, but you'll know it if you do) have a ram cooldown of between 5 and 15 seconds."
0,Gem please please expand the farm befor you start mining the one block again in the next episode you will get over run with them and make it harder to move the animals when you do expand it
0,Anybody else just learned that you can steal wandering traders’ llamas without killing the trader?
0,I haven't played MC in so long. I didn't know the foxes went after the bunnies or wolves went after the sheep. Seems legit lol Very good and scary at the same time lol I'll have to remember that in next play through.
0,Strudel
0,It was definitely the goats who killed your sheep. They can target any other mob within 16 blocks of themselves but not other goats. So thats your culprit
0,Gem needs to bring back emotional support chicken !
1,whats the mod that makes the helmet look like a crown??
0,"gem please, your missing an oak pillar by the stairs to the barn"
1,The dog should be named Wesley
0,29:91 haha lama butt😂
0,I hope the animal farm doesn’t end up like the book
0,u should name the dog king tbh
0,15th on trending sheesh i think u will reach 2M before ur bday nevermind this summer 🎉
0,Yay for new Gem vid! And yay for aiming to keep all the animals alive!
0,When Gen picked up a raw chicken and a blue egg. I think something happened to her new chicken 😐
0,Hey dude is this what you eat? To a goat is crazyyyy😂
0,Just what i needed to calm down before my exams start🫶 perfect timing thank you so much
0,DEXTER
6,Monster parties always destroy those 2 blocks on each side of the OneBlock. The layer underneath is what you need to keep blocks from falling into the void. (parties only break blocks on the same level as the OneBlock)
0,The goats definitely killed the poor sheep. I had a feeling it may be a bad idea putting them together with sheep but wasn't sure myself until the poor murder scene of sheep came up. I hope you'll be able to get more sheep to fill that back up and maybe don't keep every single animal that spawns. It got a big amount really quick with especially the goats and rabbits. And it would be easier to manage as well in my opinion. (Plus avoid potential lag from too many mobs in one place)
1,It's great to see how you're able to take random materials and make stuff that actually looks really nice. I'm trying to learn how to do that myself so this is great to get some inspiration from
0,Your sheep died because goats will ram into other mobs! I learned the hard way as well!
0,Hopefully you can get another sheep at some point. I think the fox ate the one you lost.
0,lily illy silly molly gem 2.0 some names for the doggy
0,I have tried Sky Factory before but I get the feeling this will be more fun for me.
0,:D
0,"I only got 2 goats and one jumped to their death @_@
What triggers merchant spawns? I haven't gotten any yet"
0,For the dog you could call it Geminitayrier like your name plus terrier.
0,Goats ram. Thats why the sheep died
1,This series is so fun! Uh as for dog name suggestions; naming them after the biome wave so like Arctic or Tundra would be so cute! Plus its a white wolf like snow n’ stuff so it fits!
0,"Snow is a SUPER FAST block to accumulate quickly. If you position a golem in the middle of a 2x2 square of fences, it puts it directly over 4 separate blocks. If one of those is a slab or other ""partial"" block the golem will place snow layers on the other three. If you position yourself correctly, you can mine all three at the same time. I'm not exactly sure what blocks all work for this, I'm using an enchanter as a nearly indestructible block I can't break while using the farm. My settup uses a pair of hopper minecarts on a circular track underneath to collect and distribute the snowballs across 8 hoppers feeding into a pair of auto crafters. It can fill a double chest of snow blocks in a couple minutes. Perfect for large construction projects or as an fast-breaking temporary block when building. WAY faster than any cobble/stone generator"
2,"Some of your captions are wrong btw. ""Highlight"" instead of ""Highland"", ""ruthless"" instead of ""roofless"" etc. Might want to talk to whoever does that"
0,Great name for your dog would be Jimbo 👍
0,"I have an idea for your dog’s name: Duck, because he will always be sitting there, he will be a literal sitting duck :D"
0,"Doggy name suggestion: Wanda.
(Because you got it in the winter theme and Wanda kinda sounds like Winter) :3"
0,I’m so happy this is back gem. Thank you !
0,"cant believe you are building a zoo, totally copying scar! (Just came from his stream replay haha, i love this series)"
0,"goats kill other mobs, like sheeps"
0,Remember that goats ram things. Leaving them with other mobs might allow it to kill them. It can also ram you off the island. So make sure the goats are properly thought about.
1,"Gem your different series are so great that I started minecraft again... didn't even know I'd ever be interested in it again... especially building in survival. Seeing you do so much in either your one skyblock, hardcore or hermitcraft really is inspirational. 

Plus knowing you could do all that, be a content creator and still do your academic really is amazing (especially for me as an current uni student)🔥"
0,BABE WAKE UP GEM ONE BLOCK IS BACK
0,"name the dog ""Ichi"" means one in japanese 🥰"
0,I wasn’t around for the first one block series but I’m really enjoying this one! Glad you brought it back!
0,Im guessing the goats rammed the sheep since thats what they like to do is ram things
0,"Fair warning for anyone planing to play this update of OneBlock who wants to keep your animals alive... (slight spoiler so read at your own risk)











You want all your animals at least 20 blocks away from whatever arena/containment cell you build around the OneBlock. One of the phases spawned me a Warden and I lost all my turtles to it's sonic attacks before I could kill it. By the time the Block randomly generated me more, it had already spawned the End Portal and this did something to mess up their breeding... even when I put sand at/around the OneBlock they wouldn't lay eggs anymore. It was as if their ""home beach"" coordinate was corrupted by the Portal just below. I eventually had to use commands to fix the issue and ""replace"" the bugged turtles with ones that could actually lay eggs.

A similar issue: any villagers spawned by the OneBlock will function like normal villagers for trade, but cannot have children... So you *have* to use cured villagers or villagers from the *very rare* spawn eggs found in chests. Once you have those, you can make a standard breeder and have infinite villagers."
0,"The moment you put the goats in with the sheep, I was like... NOOO! RIP sheep!

Goats will charge and headbutt any other animal.
Hope you get another sheep!"
0,"5:10 gives me ""how i met your mother"" vibes - it's a penis..."
0,i loved the original series so im a very happy bunny youve brought it back
0,"Absolutely gorgeous barn! And I agree with the other comments, your goats are probably ramming your sheep :(, maybe upstairs ought to be goats-only so you can spread them out and hopefully minimize that"
2,"1. having converted many a coarse dirt to regular dirt in skyblock i find it easier to use a stone shovel and path it, which converts it to normal dirt! no extra tool needed, and since you're on java you can offhand the dirt and hold down right click while also pressing left click to path and break it!
2. the wandering trader update where he buys things isn't just a skyblock thing, it's new vanilla! and getting that sugar cane so early in one block is insanely lucky
3. i'm so excited this map got updated to the most recent version bc it didn't get an update for so long and now there's so many cool things! i love that the cold mob variants were included with the tundra phase. i started playing one block again myself after seeing you start it up again and just finished phase 2, so i'm eager to have them in my own world :)"
1,"Your original OneBlock Series is what introduced me to this variant of skyblock, so when I finally got around to buying minecraft (after having just watched Hermitcraft for years) I decided my world would be on OneBlock. I'm now several months in and have a large number of farms and am in the process of making so many more. I've died plenty of times, but I've only lost my stuff to the void on a handful of occasions. The one that really hurt was being blown off the edge by a few Breezes that spawned from the Block... most of the other deaths felt like ""my fault"" but that one was frustrating. Their wind charges opened all the doors I had trapping other mobs into my arena... so they broke containment."
1,"I love gems videos, they give off this warm cozy vibe that is difficult to find these days, gotta love that ❤"
0,this type of series being back in 2025 was not on my bingo card but I'm so happy it is🔥

0,"Not a name for the dog, but would you consider naming the highland cow Cooper?"
0,"The island already looks so nice!I like the way you plan and build, so creative :) Can't wait to see more :D"
0,"I'm not sure what order to put them in ( Hermitcraft - OneBlock - Guess Build ), but those 3 keep me watching 100%"
0,You should definetly make the middle look like a colloseum with pillars going up in the circle around it so that its a fighting arena just like you said that would be sooo nice !❤❤ and you could make it like fall apart and make it look overgrown!
0,Name the Goat ETHO! 🐐
2,"I think that Bitsy is a cute name for a dog, also your dog has one of the new dog personalities, I think it's the happy one."

0,Yes goats kill sheep
0,"Gem, can I interest you in a subscription to your friend Pixlriffs Chanel...you're be amazed at what he could teach you about survival minecraft...say dandylions and rabbits😅"
0,Hey gem I hate it when people play Minecraft and they call a tame wolf dogs I mean they are not dogs they are wolfs call it a pet wolf bc that will fit in the fantasy of Minecraft bc in real life you can’t own a pet wolf
0,That was so convenient that a wandering trader spawned when it did so that you could get leads to help you move your animals!
0,I have a dog name! Crystal would be cute. (in my opinion) Or Amethyst!
0,"love this series and the hard core with che multi village hope it will get update too
1"
4,I think a cute name would be snowball or snow flake because she/he came from the snow biome ❤😁
0,My mind was just blown; for 14 years I thought you could only breed pigs with carrots.
1,23:08 I love highland cows and i am so lucky for my neighbours having them in their field❤❤❤
0,Nods. OG barn.
1,"Gem mentioning making a bunny meadow, it would be such a cute place fo also keep bees if she can get some! Maybe some fireflies or frogs? Idk but A meadow sounds like a super cute idea"
2,GEM ITS PAINFUL TO SEE U USE WOOD FOR FUEL MAKE CHARCOAL! Step 1. Put any wood log type of choice into furnace and burn it (cant be planks or stripped or 4 sided) Step 2. Take it out and u have charcoal <3 edit: you should name the wolf pearl bc she has a wolf in almost every series she does<3
0,The dogs name should be tilly
5,"My little cousins suggested Dennis for the wolf!

24:35 My guess? A goat only had one horn so I think they've been trying to ram you. One probably went to ram you when you walked by and rammed a sheep by accident :(

Keep up the amazing work Gem! <3"
0,"24:38 a goat might’ve rammed into a sheep, causing it to die"
0,You could name the dog Lithos it means precious stone in greek
0,Goats do headbutt and kill other mobs so it was good that you separated them from the sheep!
0,✨💚🤩💚✨
0,I would love if in the next episode she makes a big cool farm area
0,Hey Gem! Heres a tip! In the new update it made it so you could just shear the leads off of the animals! That could be useful for getting wandering traders lamas next time!
1,"I know it’s just being resourceful but the named chests are really bugging me because the names have seemingly nothing to do with the contents. Also I think the dog looks like an Elizabeth, Zeus, or Diana something grand to signify their importance in guarding and watching over the growing world. Love your channel by the way and enjoying the new series"
0,Not every animal have their own chicken friend
0,PLS POST MORE YOU ARE MY FAVORITE
0,Yayyyyy another episode!!!
0,You should name the puppy Oswald!
0,"9:37 gemmmm in the last 10sec u placed one of the stripped birch logs sideways instead of upright, idk if it’s important but i thought id let u know"

0,This series has convinced me to try the map.
0,Ahhhh I’m so pumped for this series!!
0,Love the One Block series. I feel genuinely sad that there is just one remaining lamb. Naughty goats.
1,"The reason why the goats killed the sheep is because goats will like charge at animals or players causing damage. Also fun fact if you have a goat charge at you, but it hits a solid block you get it’s goat horn love the content keep up the good work❤❤❤❤


Edit you can place mushrooms at night with no limitations I think"
4,"These videos are the best for a lazy sunday. Just sitting here petting my cat, Playing Vampire Survivors and watching Gem. Cozy with cute animals and a bit of violence. perfection"
0,GEM!!!!! YOU LEFT A STRIPPED BIRCH LOG THE WRONG WAY ON THE BARN
61,"Fun stuff!  Since you're mostly using stone tools, you can extend them by merging worn tools in the crafting square.  The benefit is you get an extra 10% wear points from merging!  So two 50 point tools give you not just 100 points but 110.  You have enough chest space to store the worn down stuff in the meantime, so plenty of options.  This works for any non-enchanted item.  Have fun!"
0,9:27 please fiz this birch sideways!!! 🥹
0,I vote the dog's name is Woofus.
0,5:08 I was laughing my 4ss off. Gem didn't realize that looks exactly like a penis
0,"Since the dog spawned in the episode where you built the barn, perhaps the dog's name could be Barney?

I think the fox that decided to live with you in your house also deserves a name btw. She clearly loves you! Roxy the foxy perhaps?"
1,"So close to 2 million subs!           

Edit: I posted this before she said that also LOL"

0,"Dog Name: Barley (and my other daughter says ""Fluffernutter"""
2,"I also love the new mob variants. I think the new chickens are my favorite (wish the warm biom chickens had green tail feathers), but I like all the new variants. They even updated wolves further with different personalities. There's about 6 new cadences from a deep ""woof"" of a big dog to one that sounds like it's sick all the time. 😊"

0,21:00 dog name can be Chim please 😃
0,"24:55 goats attack every mob (including players) that don't move for long enough. I'm guessing that's what happen to the sheep, and the chicken a bit earlier in the video"
1,"Pro tip: The goats eat the other mobs. That’s why you can’t put them with the sheep. It’s also why you found a raw chicken on the ground. And why the sheep died.
Another pro tip: You can place mushrooms on blocks normally at nighttime because it’s dark. Then you can bone meal the mushrooms to grow giant mushrooms and get even more mushrooms. You just have to wait for night to fall to plant your mushrooms on a block other than podzol or mycelium. Alternatively, you can buy podzol from wandering traders to start farming them."

0,"Gem, I think one of the goats rammed the sheep. One of them was missing a horn."
3,Build a small house (with door and roof) around the one block and where the monster party spawns. It will contain the monsters. Add a few spaces where you can attack through the house. Big help.
0,"I started playing this map after your last episode. I'm excited to learn how you figure out how to handle a particular challenge coming up! You're way better than me though, I found out the hard way that foxes like bunnies and chickens!
I started playing in beta and quit playing shortly after the combat update except for periodic ""one week phases"" where I never messed with foxes"

Ya, definitely not me judging the half built roof..."

anyway. I think the dog looks like a Jamie."

0,Mean goatee killed dem sheep I bet 😢
1,GEM THE GOAT WILL KILL THE SHEEP!
0,Can anyone tell me when pigs started wanting Potatoes? And do they still go for carrots? Lol
2,I think the reason the sheep are dying is because they’re standing still. Goats will charge at things standing still. Hope this helps!
0,I started playing one block for the first time because of your first episode! I am enjoying it and have so many plans for both the world with my partner and my own. Excited for the next video!
0,"I tried to play oneblock once and was absolutely devastated when I reached the nether phase almost everything I had built burned down after the stone wall I had made around it had exploded. Took me two years of mourning to continue it again. So just a reminder before you start the nether phase, create a stone wall with a roof around the block big enough to contain a ghast."

1,Douglas the dog.
0,"I think you built a fence/wall around the one block to prevent surprise attacks from mobs. That would be a good idea this time around, at least to keep unexpected guests fenced in"
3,"Gem: ""How did my sheep die!"" 
The goat with a missing horn: 👀"
0,have the snow golem open so they van help you with enemies when they spawn
4,The absolute best thing to watch whilst eating cereal in the morning.

0,Under 2 hours
0,Gem got a lot of goats simply because she's the ____
0,"Hi Gem. Fun series, I love the attention you put into your builds. Pro tip, you can get infinite water with a single water source and bonemeal. When you apply bonemeal to a block with flowing water on it, it becomes a water source block."
1,"So since Gem got ice this comment is useless for her. I am wondering how many people know that you can make an infinite water source with 1 water bucket,  and what other item?

Answer below















Answer is Bone meal."

0,Gem lets plays are always my favorite ^_^
343,"As someone who loves building cute little farms in minecraft... goats are menaces. They will headbutt everything you love. They ABSOLUTELY killed your sheep AND the chicken that was in there, I was worried as soon as you put the goats in there with them. They must be contained by themselves and they must be contained on all sides because they WILL jump out. Little menaces."
1,you should name the dog something feirce for the fighting arena like hunter or dagger or warrior or maybe a warriors name so it can be tuff and cool!
0,A wolf name suggestion could be firefly or daisy maybe I don't know. :)

goats will target and ram a mob sitting still within 16 blocks of it. this however does not include other goats, I do not specifically know if itll try to target mobs further than it can actually reach (through fences) but 
1. goats can only coexist with other goats
2. if theyre still ramming, they just need to be 16 blocks away from other mobs

hope this helps!"

0,You should name the dog Rufus
0,what a lovely episode again gem!!
2,Penny will be a cute name for the doggy:3 It just fits with the whole video I think? Hehe
0,i love the barn! you could just allocate the grass to the sheep because in reality they are the only ones who need and put it to use to grow wool.
0,Name the dog Snowball or Winter because they spawned during the icy phase
0,You should call the dog fuzz ball or marshmallow
0,The goat probably rammed into the sheep and killed it unfortunately.
1,"Wow, you really do learn something new every day!
-You can un-coarse coarse dirt
-Bunnies follow flowers??
-Wandering traders now buy items for emeralds (I actually discovered this yesterday, new feature)
-You can tame trader llamas

These are things I've never done in my 12 years of playing this game!

Proverbs 23:12"
0,hi gem i think you should name your dog winter cause you got (him/her idk) in the winter phase and he/her fur is white
0,You could name your dog coco or daisy

33,"Seeing new people start watching because of this series feels so surreal because I remember my first video of yours I saw was the FIRST episode of the 1.16 update! You’ve come so far, it was such a wonderful journey to see Gem ❤"
0,Did the goats charge and hit the sheep?
0,"I am an real noob with Minecraft and learn so much from this! Can someone explain to me how the ice-block gives her infinite water? Would it also have been an infinite source if she would have used only water buckets, or does it only work with ice blocks? (28:28)"
2,Being chronically online and finally see a hermit video mainly gem is extremely exciting
1,Skybark
0,"I think the dog should be named Ruffles, I don't why but it just popped up in head."

1,What about Arctic? because you got the wolf form the Arctic level.
0,loving this series! also have you ever tried Vintage Story? i feel like it's a game you will seriously like!
0,given one of the goats was missing a horn (lost from ramming a wall) i'm guessing that yes they killed the other animals in the pen
1,You got me playing this… was zero deaths until the later rounds where a warden spawned and my 40 arrows were not enough.
0,❤

484,Goats like to ram walls! They probably rammed into the sheep and did damage a few times :)
533,"The obvious name for the dog would be Winnie of course, but if you don't want yet another dog named Winnie, I would suggest naming the dog ""Isla"". It's a nice name and it fits since the entire map is a floating island!"
0,earlyyyy
0,YAYAYAY EPISODE TWOO. Hiya gem <3

2,Name the dog winnie plsss 🩷🩷🩷
0,what a great thing to wake up to
0,AHH im early f pr once
1672,"7:54 Welcome Gem!! Also, not all flowers, Just Dandelions... Rabbits IRL also eat dandelions, and are said to be quite fond of them too. Xisuma used this in his S7 Potion Brewery for a MASSIVE rabbit farm for rabbit's foot (Leaping potions)

(Edit) 24:40 the Goat has one horn, that means it rammed into, and killed, the sheep. Goats ram anything that is standing still for a specific period of time. Goats need to be kept seperate, they'll even kill each other if they're kept together."
0,YES GEM!
0,"Just woke up and went to YouTube, Gem popped up and I got so exited"
0,Seems like you should build a shelter around the one block area so mobs don't escape. Fence gate walls with a roof

0,is this gonna be continued? :3 love watching skyblock and oneblock :)
0,OneBlock was the first series I binged of yours after you joined Hermitcraft. I loved it and I'm glad you're back!

0,Looks like you kept waiting on coal.  Could've used the oven to cook up charcoal and make all the torches you need.
0,Found your channel through the OG One Block series before I ever played Minecraft. You inspired me to start playing and now the game is such a core part of my life. It feels like a special full circle moment to see you come back to this concept. SO excited to watch 💜💜
0,Can you guys please more swp
0,"Struggling over coal, don't forget you can smelt logs into charcoal...."

0,YOUR THE BEST YOUTUBER IN THE WORLD'!!!!!!!!!!!!!I also Gemma🤓😎
0,It’s her daughter Gemma I love your vids and could you please 🙏 visit New Zealand 🙏 pretty please I’m your biggest fan I’m begging you
0,Hi I'm a new follower to the channel and i love your videos
2,"Woohoo! 🎉 We're back on one block! This is one of my favorite series that you do. I mean, I love everything! But this one has a special blend of coziness, risk, and satisfaction 🙂

I do the coliseum thing as well. However, I like to build a 5x5 pit around the one block, so all the mobs drop down two or three blocks. I can stand on the edge to mine it and occasionally hop across to collect things, but creepers and such don't just walk into my good areas. In the past I've tried stone walls and stuff. Anything that is placed in a two block radius around the one block will get deleted, I believe. Or at least it used to. I'm glad this series is not hardcore so that regardless of how aggressive the mobs get against you or your builds we'll still have a full series out of this one 😅"
0,"even though she's only posted two episodes, I've already rewatched them both a handful of times <3 this series is quickly becoming a comfort series and I can't wait for more. :]"
0,"I haven’t watched gem in SOOO LONG, and omg I missed you so much girl. BUT J AM BACK"

1,"These solo plays are a fantasic contrast to her plays with others like the REPO videos. How sweet and loving Gem is. Then the twin comes out with the Dads and gang where she is tearing them apart with no chill, Especially Pearl. All done with that same love and devotion just not the sweetness. Love yea Gem!"
0,11:19 SHE KNOWS THE MEMES

0,Always love your Skyblock series ❤
0,yay its back :D
0,4:54  Maybe We’ll skip over wooden tools *5 minutes later* 9:53
0,"Hi Gem, been following you for awhile. my name is Jerome. Been following you awhile. I’m wondering if you have any tips or tricks for up and coming Minecraft YouTubers. Thanks."
0,"AWESOME VIDEO!!! I just want to ask, where do you get skyblock? I’m on bedrock ;-;"
0,"My first death was because a stupid goat pushed me off. with a bunch of stuff on me.
And a fox killed all the chickens, so both of those are kill on sight now.
All because both can jump so high..."
0,YASSSSSS!!!!
0,Fun
0,"please have a look at the skyfactory modpack, i think you'd love it"
0,What happened to new life
1,Nice❤
0,"another amazing video published on this fine, established, google owned site"
0,"Wow, Gem!  This was so much fun!!!  Sometimes it is really fun to see just you and your content!  I love your single player vibe!"
3,2:38 you didn’t let grass spread
0,I remember the first video of the one block world 🥺🩷 I was soooo happy when I saw this today ❤
0,"I love One Block MC too, but tbh, I hate switching tools all the time. Maybe if you want I can recommened to you the Sophisticated Storage mod, which just only gives you backpacks and upgrade for it which does not change the out come of this series, also in the mod you can find a really cool backpack upgrades which allows you to automaticly switch the right tool for the right block in instant, which helped me a lot to enjoy the grind more ^^ great episode"
0,Pig no1 do be just standing like a chill guy the whole start
0,"""creepers and stuff can spawn"" well, that's utterly horrifying to hear given the situation... those things have taken me out on normal maps more than i can count let alone a map over the void.

OH MY GOD!!! I never even thought about Phantoms in One Block!"
0,"Wow what a surprise, i just found your channel 2-3 days ago and through the one block series only and i loved watching that series and wished if you would have continued the series but guess what you are starting the series again, hope this time you take it even farther. All the best with the series, looking forward to it!!!!"
0,"At this point, I'm positive you have already recorded more and probably have infinite water. Still, for next time, did you know you can make infinite water with 1 bucket of water and 1 bone meal? You should look into it👍"
0,You can get charcoal by putting logs in the furnace. You can also build the bottom section of a mob farm under the block to make it MUCH safer as mobs start to spawn.
0,Is there a reason nobody goes down 3 blocks and puts a torch so the falling blocks just break when they hit the torch?
0,"You're such a nerd.

I love nerds."
0,"Gem not realising move can't spawn on slabs, and that the only spawnable blocks were properly lit is so cute lol :P"
0,Exciting! Love one block
0,"I'm guessing you probably already know this, but just in case you don't, you can use charcoal to make a campfire too! Also our starter houses look pretty similar! Makes sense cause your builds are a huge inspiration for me. :3"
0,Gem pls s my d?
0,"If you build under the block you can mine from the bottom and the mobs should spawn on top so you will not have the jump scares. 

For extra spicy a water flow onto a hopper and you won't need to go up to collect the broken blocks. 

If you don't care about the mobs that can be a campfire over a hopper and you won't need to deal with the hostiles at all, but I like to collect the friends to add life to the island."
0,Yay back to one block!
0,She swooped that bunny. She saw her chance to catch it and gottem before it even flinched
0,OMG! SO super entirely stoked for this playthrough! yay!
0,"Gem I’m not gonna lie to you, I love you but… all your voice and videos are so relaxing I can’t really watch you cause it’s so soothing I end up just passing out. This is my 5th time watching this cause I can’t watch it without passing out 💀😭"
1,"Great energy and easy voice to listen too. Don't know if anyone else mentioned this but I think you have a grass block in one of the storage chests, it was a quick flash as you were opening the chests. You could have uses it in the fenced area instead of waiting for it to travel from the one block space. Look forward to watching the series progress. :)"
0,the lighting and mob spawning issue in early skyblock is why I love building most of the initial platform out of half slabs on the bottom half of the block to prevent spawning
0,plz more
0,"Wonderful! I've not really watched one of these fully before, so I think this will make for a good first watch."
0,Does anyone know a proper OneBlock like this for Bedrock? I find tons of different ones but I'm not sure what one is the right one.

0,I loved this series! Glad you brought it back!
0,"Nice to see you return to one block.  Your first try was my introduction to your channel and what got me to try one block too.  I moved and quit my world around the time you quit yours, so maybe it's time I try again too."
0,Hey GEM! I have a build for your oneblock that will make it SUPER easy to take care of anything that spawns from the one block AND it autocollects everything that spawns from the oneblock! It also puts you in a safe location away from where the block spawns entities! If you are interested let me know! I've got the schematic saved somewhere!
0,I've been on the road to Peak Anxiety all week. What a great surprise. :)
0,I remember watching that series tho i didn't know i was watching you for a long time

0,"She's an alright content creator, she's A-Otay"
0,Map from who?
0,"Thank you for linking the map!!! I’ve been looking for it for foreverrrr! The only maps I’ve found have been very boring: don’t spawn mobs from the block, it’s just grass, spruce, oak, stone, ore 🥱"
0,Are you able to get a happy ghast in this version of Minecraft??
0,Rabbits also like dandelion and will follow you if your holding it.
0,"Ive never played or watched one block videos before and this looks SO much fun!! Absolutely cant wait to see Gem's concept of the raised houses and colosseum area in the middle, thats geniussss!! Also forever calling phantoms ""sky rats"" now LOL"
0,"YOU might wanna change the wooden platform to stone someday, goodness knows what could spawn, and also to prevent creepers scaring you, you could build 4 trapdoors attached to eachother 3 blocks high, it will act as a mini mob farm, I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS NOTIFICATION, GEMM! YOU INSPIRE ME A LOTT❤"

0,"I think your voice is really cute, just listening gives me tingles.
Kinde wanna play with you on some Survivl and want to build some EPIC structures.
Hope you have a nice Time as a Youtuber <3"
0,WOOO I'm so excited for the series!!
0,This made me want to go back and try one block myself again. So I did. This map is vicious! Those vex are deadly and then the ghasts!? I was not prepared.
0,My kids watch a ton of minecraft youtube videos. So. I started doing the same to better understand them. And found your channel and it's awesome. Informative. Funny. And very chill. Keep being awesome.
0,Very glad you centered the house! 😊
1,"When I start, I always first collect iron, the cobble, then coal. Don't you?"
0,"So excited for this!! I recently finished binge watching your old sky block series, and I can’t wait to see what you get up to in this one! 🤩"

0,I was just listening to wicked then I started watching gem and I thought has gem ever watched wicked😮

0,"Lovely looking house! I finally decided to try OneBlock thanks to this video, looking forward to it!"
0,"Omg I’m so excited! I loved both your skyblock and your one block series, they are so fun"
5,"Hi Gem! I love your Skyblock series so much! I think it would be super cute if you built a little mushroom soup stand for your mooshroom cow, like a cozy little spot where she can share her soup with others. Just a fun idea! Thanks for all the cozy vibes!"
0,i love how the pigs are watching you 🥰
1,"Only just discovered you, but love the video! Such a cozy vibe to minecraft that I enjoy!!"
0,"You should try the ""Extreme"" version (just callend One Block Extreme).

The infinite block is ONLY dirt, and you have to craft every other block you want. It's really advanced,  and super complex. 

I recommend it."
4,"Oh my gosh, no way 😭 I remember binging ALL of your skyblock series a while back, you’re seriously one of my favorite comfort YouTubers 🤍"
0,Brand new to your videos but already in love. Looking forward to the rest of this series! ❤

0,"I am glad to see you return to some Channel Root content, very nostalgic to say the least. As always, keep up the great content that you always put out, Gem."
0,11:30 that would have been Cleo in episode 1 of 3rd life if no one noticed a tree grew on her.
0,"You could technically make your base creeper proof gem!
Waterlogged slaps and stairs dont explode since minecraft treats it like an explosion inside water"
0,I was so excited when I got the notification!!!!
0,I JUST finished the old series so thank you for doing this

1,shaders.
0,i cant be the only one who heard the snapchat call sound between the 5-6 minute mark?!?
0,"With all that wood, even a single piece of coal should enable an unlimited supply of charcoal."
0,Wow! I remember watching the one block series from ep1 and your bridges was so unique i tried to copy them and started playing alongside you. Lets finish this one tho. 😂😂
0,I’m so excited for this series to be back! I need a reprieve from all the other Minecraft content and just chill with Gem while she conquers the one block skyblock world.
1,YEAHHHHHHHH
0,Hi Gem! A reminder that you can smelt some charcoal for torches if you're running out of coal :)
0,Calling phantoms sky rats is so real
0,Automation of one block this time ?
0,i've been here ever since the first skyblock series and god i am so happy it's back! Goodluck Gem !!
0,yesss nostalgia time :)
0,"I never understood why people don't use the bottom half when doing slabs, so mobs can't spawn on top.. At least in the early stages, before torches are a thing."
0,heck yeah! more one block! :D
0,why not inclose one block area in fences to be more safe from creepers
0,"this is so calming it feels like what I should do next in mc, since I've been feeling like i need a change of paise after DAGESMP
.
[ Tue 3:09am 5/6/2025 ]"
0,I like your voice so muchhhhh
0,I'm so excited for this... I loved the previous ones and can't wait to see what you do with this one!
0,im not a regular viewer but i really enjoyed this video and am looking forward to the rest of the series
2,23:04 you should use MOSS for the roof! ❤
0,Gem threw that axe like she it was a camera and she was running away from a phasmo ghost lol
0,remember the old day?? we hopefully got the webcam back for the nect episode 😊❤
0,"hey Gem, absolutely love ur MINECRAFT episodes especially, expecting more of this solo series...love you!!"
0,"Don't forget you can smelt logs to get charcoal. This map looks so fun, might need to give it a try one day!"
0,"Okay so I know she said it before Wild Life, but I feel like since teaming with Joel, Gem says ""for goodness' sakes"" a lot more and I think that's so fun :D"
0,"This is the first Minecraft video I watched all the way through in a while. I love the chill, hangin' with Gem vibe."
0,"Hi Gem! 👋🏻😁  It's great to see you playing One Block again.  Yay!  So nostalgic. 🥰

You're doing surprisingly well with the block pallette so early in the game.  The house is looking pretty good even with the unfinished roof. 😲👍🏼

BTW, how in the world did you end up with non-suicidal bunnies? 🧐  They usually just yeet themselves off the edge. 😅"
0,omg no way my name is taylor and I’m also from canada🦭
0,Omg I’m soooo excited to see you do this again! I haven’t played one block since I switched to pc and you’ve inspired me!
0,Yo I absolutely love your skyblock vids
0,i missed this series so much
0,What do you mean you were a much smaller channel the first time? It was only a few months ago. Only... August 2020??? WHAT?
0,"That first skyblock series is how I found gem! Feeling very nostalgic, my life has changed a lot since"
0,"Super cute and super cozy! cant wait to see the one block coliseum of death! but you know, cute and cozy."
0,I saw the video in my recommended and thought it was the older one... SO glad I clicked on it!!! The nostalgia really is there... Cant wait to see more:)
0,wooden picks get be used as fuel in a smelter :P
0,"this here? this here is what i needed in my life :) thanks gem, feels like most youtubers rush through these things with the overly simple goal of beating the game like that you just take each episode in bite sized peices... loved your original skyblock world and am excited to see this one too :)"
0,I missed your voice 💙
0,I use old wooden tools as furnace fuel.
0,Let's complete this one❤😅
0,"I could watch this for hours. Please post more often!! Your videos are so cozy, they're perfect to watch after work."
0,Love how Gem just casually takes on creepers! I would be so shocked to even move! 😅😅😅
0,"I'd love to see your approach to a big modpack like ATM to the skies or Oceanblock 2. I've seen lots of technical minecraft players play them, but I would love to see how a aesthetics first builder plays the pack with all the decorative block options!"
0,"Play Dinkum please, i thing you would like it ❤"
1,"I've seen so much of you candidly from Hermitcraft and (mainly) GIGS Phasmo VODs, but I've never seen one of your videos until YouTube just recommended this to me, haha. Your ""YouTube voice"" is quite different from your candid voice, lol (Not a bad thing, just a funny observation)! I've always enjoyed these sorts of ""challenge"" series, so I'll stick around for this! Maybe I'll binge some of your existing Hermitcraft stuff too!"
0,What's crazy is I just watched the old videos yesterday!!!!
1,"If you had built the slabs on the bottom half of the blocks they would be spawn proof.

Once you have a furnace you can make plenty of charcoal by smelting logs. I don't remember the recipe for the workstation so maybe you don't have the mats yet."
0,"Okay, but the pig's death actually hurt to see."
0,[with the tree and the pig]
0,when the pig died the same thing happend last time with the chicken it was like a year pr two ago!!!!!!!!
0,Would love watching some Skyblock co op
0,A rabbit encloser would be so cute
0,"""Well don't seem so happy about it gosh"" was the most Ariana Grande Glinda phrase ever and I love it"
0,"Back on track!!!! Am sooo happy and this feels WAY more nostalgic than it should (I am getting old, help?) anyways, one block-ing is very relaxing to watch and Im looking forward to the next episode!!! :GemHeart:"
0,"i have to keep thinking about the quote ""its so easy being geminitay"" (said by gem herself) every time a mob volutarily jumps into the animal pen"
0,"Jokes aside, I'm excited for One Block, Season 2"
0,This is such a blessing!!
0,"""Fists are fine."" - GeminiTay, 2025 🤣🤣"
0,So excited for this! When I first found your channel I fell in love the your skyblock series and binged all of them. Happy it’s back 🤩
0,"one block is what got me on your channel and once you joined hermitcraft I was hooked, but I still loved one block and go back and watch the episodes that I missed, so I’m so excited its back!!"
0,Not sure if she remembers but Gem actually did finish a oneblock hardcore series. Used to watch it on repeat haha
0,"Why does everyone throw that first wooden tool into the void? 
It's fuel! Burn that up in your furnace and smelt some stuff. <3

One other thing, maybe build a fence around the one block to contain mobs? It's a strategy I've seen others use and it seems to work pretty well. 

What a fun episode. Can't wait to see more. :D"
0,Definitely looking forward to this series!
0,i found you from your original old sky block im glad i get to see it fresh
0,i love the chill vibes so much! this video is so cozy :]

0,"Love this, miss the hardcore vids tho!!"
0,Watching your skyblock was the first time I watched your channel!! I can’t believe it’s been so long!

0,"Oh man, Im actually quite excited to see you play this! I dont normally watch your channel out of the other hermits but Imma stick around for this series"
0,OMG YES
0,I really liked the old series. I'm glad you're back with one block
2,7:30 the one block! The One block is real!
0,YAY🎉
0,"I had thought I got free and here you go, dragging me back in to the ""life"" : )"
45,"Great video! Looking forward to the rest of the series.
(1) 1:53 Setting the first large layer of slabs one-half block lower (i.e., as bottom slabs instead of top slabs) would prevent mob spawning.
(2) 8:49 As soon as a furnace is available, charcoal is available in limitless quantities from logs and it does everything that coal does. The moment I understood this in my first Minecraft world, I stopped worrying about coal forever.
(3) 15:13 Using your first two iron for shears is not weird at all. It's the most logical thing you can do! It gives you infinite wool and, as you noted, the crucial ability to sleep away the night."
0,You can lure bunnies to a safe pen with dandelion :)
0,How did you know I watched your old video this week and was craving for more one block 😭❤️
0,"I first found you through your original Skyblock. I'm so proud of how far you've come and thankful for all the experiences you've brought to me. Keep up the amazing work, you're an inspiration"

1,"I used to be addicted to your one block series, you do not understand the emotion I felt running through my veins when I saw this"
0,"bring back the facecam gem!! thanks for playing one block again, was just watching that series"
0,I didn't realize this video was playing while i was busy fighting 3 people on Minecraft (bedrock :l) I'll sub later 😊
0,"I missed the first one block/skyblock series, im so excited to catch this one!!!"
0,What world/skyblock did you buy?
1,Noo can we please get another episode 😊
0,ohh i love this kind of series so much! it’s cozy
0,"you don't have to say ""literally"" for phrases that don't have a corresponding metaphorical use"
0,"16:11
Yes, so I remapped it to i
Yet I still drop things"
0,"its cool to see you do this again Gem, I first discovered you doing the same type of one block challenge"
0,Your original skyblock was how I found your channel originally! I was so excited because you were the first canadian Minecraft youtuber I ever found. And then you started hermitcraft and my status as a fan was officially cemented by the introduction to it!
0,"This is my absolute favorite series of yours, I’m so glad it’s back <3"
0,"In the time where bigger and bigger goals and achievements are being made, this video kind of feels like a slice of life.. something chill and nostalgic. Keep it up, Gem."

1,"I watched the other one block, it was great. looking forward to season 2!"
0,"Yayyy!!! New Gem One Block!!! I keep rewatching her old one, so this is perfect! :D"
0,12:30 the crazy flash back those chest gave me to early Minecraft 😢
1,Gem!! Monsters can’t spawn on slabs so your base it weirdly super safe at night!!!❤❤❤
2,can't wait for episode 2‼️😩
2,Heckyes!! I am so excited to see you on oneblock again.
0,i just love this! 😍 so sad the og one block is not available in bedrock
0,New Sub here I like this Skyblock idea. Different then traditional MC I'm hooked Please continue with it and set up an end goal.
289,"Hi Gem! Cool little tip that you might not know: Potatoes can actually be used to breed pigs. You don't just need carrots, you can also use potatoes and beetroots as well. Thought that it might be helpful since I'm pretty sure out of those three, you've only gotten a potato."
0,"I have always enjoyed the challenge of skyblock. I am curious though, why you are top blocking slabs instead of bottom. Did they make it so mobs spawn on bottom slabs?"
0,"Hi Gem, I'm happy to see you play One Block! 👍❤️"
0,"11:25 ""we should be completely o..ohh my gosh"""
0,REDEMPTIONNN
0,Nobody ever remembers about charcoal :(
0,You should block off the middle so the monsters can’t get to all the nice stuff u build.  Make a lil trap
0,Gem you can make charcoal by smelting logs so you can expand more and keep putting torches wherever you need them
1,So excited to watch you play this one. You're literally the person who got me into one/sky block.
0,I've been waiting...😢
2,"That was a really chill video, very pleasant to watch. Can't wait to see the island grow !!
Good luck and thanks you for the content."
0,"To get torches, you could smelt logs for charcoal which works just like coal"
0,My favorite series is back!!!!!!!!
0,When I saw you uploaded this I was so excited to watch it while on the treadmill. But I still have 30 minutes to go so... I need more!!! 
0,I'm just internally screaming when I see that gem is not letting the grass spread in the first few minutes 😱
0,I was craving to do one of these but with magic andtech mods. ♥
0,"One Block Series Again!! Your original one block series was one of my first introductions to your channel, and skyblock itself to be honest. I loved it back than and now I can't wait to see what you have planned for this one!"
0,Commenting for Gem’s YouTube algorithm
0,"""That tree is a murderer"" 🤣"
147,13:15 Dandelions are bunny food so you can attract bunnies with it like wheat for cows/sheep... And carrot/potato for pigs
1,So happy that One Block is back! Love this series. Btw I don't think you need to really worry about mobs spawning bc i dont think they can spawn on slabs. So just the full blocks are where the mobs will prob spawn.
0,can't wait for more of this honestly
0,What one block is this the name of it?
0,You WERE a much smaller channel back then. But you are such high quality. I'm glad I was there for it. <3

0,"OMG I've recently been binge watching all your one block and skyblock videos, this makes me so happy !! ♡"
44,"""Now you guys can be friends!""
Pig 1: *turns away from pig 2*
Gem: ""........"""
0,give us a darn facecam gem
5,"8:16 - Gem: Sheep, you look perfect in the sunset. Sheep:👁👄👁"
0,Im so happy this series is back! I loved it back then!
0,Adore these series! Can’t wait for the next ep!
0,"Don't forget, if you Waterlog stairs or slabs, it makes it impossible for creapers to blow them up!"
0,Omg I love one block/skyblock I can’t wait to see your series progress Gem!
0,"Building your house off center is no problem, if you off center it enough. So you can expand it later to a yard surrounded with cosy cottages. COTTAGE CORE🤘🏽"
0,"“Get the island to a healthy start” gem, does the island go to the dentist?"
0,This is so wholesome.
0,Love this!
0,How dare YouTube hide this from me for a whole 19 hours
0,"Hey Gem, just letting you know if you use slaps like you are then mobs won’t spawn on the slabs so you don’t need to be worried about lighting stuff up."
0,Oh this is soooo exciting 😍 I hope we're also going to get some One Block Streams 🤩
0,You’re close to 2M Gem :)
0,"Roman colosseum, Roman style even? Yes, please 🤭"
0,I remember finding the old one block series years ago! It was the first of your videos that I watched and introduced me to the fandom and the hermits. So glad it's back!
0,WOOOOO REDEMPTIONNN 🎉
0,"I'm playing animal crossing (way too much) while watching this video, and for a second I thought I was going insane, then I remembered that minecraft players swear by acnh and stardew valley music XD"
1,I found Gem via that one block series :-)
0,"I was legit watching the old skyblock one block series yesterday and now this was uploaded, I manifested it lol"
0,rent is due </3 /j
0,"I actually found your channel when you did one/sky block the first time. I'm rather happy that you came back to it and can't wait to see what you do. It's a nice break from the hermits but yet also being one of the hermits ( meaning that in the best way possible ) it's just different content but still from one we all know and love. 

May the 4th be with you"
0,"Gem. Your Minecraft oneblock and skyblock was the first thing that got me into Minecraft. Now it’s my special interest and a big part of my life. Thank you, Gem"
0,Omggggg so excited ❤ I love your content so much 😄😄😄
0,"i recently learned cats scare off phantoms, so if you position some near the one block, you can get a phantom phield"
0,OMG YESS THANK U
0,"Petition to name the first pig Reuben.

Edit: uh... Nevermind."
0,Excited for this series!
4,10:42 what about for FUEL!?!?!
0,"Yeah, waiting for more granite sounds like a good idea. Rushing good things like a good roof design could spoil it. Don't wanna take your roof for granite *ba dum tss*"
0,yesssss return of my fave series!
0,0:00 THIS is a crafting table
0,"i love your skyblock/ one block series, it was one of the first videos that i saw from your channel :)."
0,"hmm, that was not what I have expected. For me, “one block” rather implies that you start Minecraft with only one block. Which can NOT regenerate. That feels like cheating. :/"
0,Gem's voice is so calming in all her videos
1,We are at one block!
0,21:15 is when Camman clicked off
0,I AUDIBLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS!!! I MISSED YOUT SKYBLOCK VIDEOS! ❤❤
0,The first “series” is what got me watching you since
0,happy birthday month gem!!! so excited for this series to celebrate ^_^
0,Oh how I’ve missed gem one block
0,Loved and followed along on your last Skyblock. So hype for this one!
0,❤❤❤
0,I literally finished watching your previous One Block Skyblock challenge last week so this made me think my YT was glitched for a moment! I'm so glad I get to enjoy this in real time now!
0,ahh yes the sigh of relief turn to disappointment I almost feel bad for the house not being centered lol
0,Eggs? In THIS economy
0,"holy moly, i didnt even realise the original one block series was 3-4 years ago!? (Been a fan since minecraft 1.13 update, so it kinda just went by) Super excited, the more gem content the better!"
0,I found you from your first one block series. You introduced me to hermitcraft and the most incredible community on YouTube. This new series makes me so happy!! ❤🎉
1,Yaya! Love this! Does anyone just love gem and pearls videos? (Also grains too)
0,wow i’m alr waiting for the next part
0,Oh no I feel the urge... the two week minecraft phase one block edition❤
0,"i love everything you post but this content is my FAVORITE from you :) never stop, you’re awesome and i love these videos. they’re so comforting"
0,"I wasnt' around for the original series but I've watched it twice since finding your channel, so excited for a new one!"
0,YEAH!!!!!( •̀ ω •́ )y
0,"well done, you are like the Bob Ross of the minecraft builders. love the commentary and designs you create. can not wait for more episodes of this series."
0,"I remember the last skyblock happy that your doing that again! 

Im gonna shut up now since this comment is awkward and terrible 😂"
0,"sky rats, very accurate nickname"
0,I'm definitely liking this one block version of skyblock since it starts with a ton of wood instead of ugly cobble floors
0,I can't believe it's been 4 years I can't wait for more
0,"I literally just rewatched the series of your one block , so I’m here for the season two GEM"
0,Yay ✨️💕
0,I’m having flashbacks
0,YAY
1,I’m so excited for this series!
0,In big 25🥀🥀🥀
0,the cottage is so cute and cosy especialy the outside the leaves add so much more to the build
0,i hope you beat the game on this playthrough it was a really good first video and it made me wanna try for myself
0,"I remember binge watching your one block series about three years ago and im so so glad you brought this back, its healing some part of me cuz I missed this type of content so much, xx"
0,Sooooo Happy that Gem brought back One Block i miss watching her play it
0,"I remember just following you just before you hit 100k! I can’t believe it’s been so long since then and so long since your first one block video 🥹 I can’t wait to keep following you through even more of your journeys. Sincerely, a long time viewer <3"
0,Love your content gem!!! So excited to see this series come back!! 🤍
0,YES! So glad you're playing 1 block again! Can't wait to see what you do.
0,"THANK YOU, GEM!! <3"
1,You got this!!!🎉

0,"@GeminiTay:
[18:20]: If i recall correctly, the sapling & the flower need to be separated by one air_block horizontally to have any chance of getting a hive."

0,EEEEe!!!! Another Gem one block video!! I love these series I'm so happy for another one!!

0,Hi gem! I love watching your videos while I crochet. They're so calm and chill!
0,NEW GEM SKYBLOCK SERIES LET'S GOOOO
0,"Oh, exciting! I look forward to seeing how you do it this time. Definitely a cozy series =)"
0,"My only question in this early game phase is... 
Why didn't you build everything a half block down to make it all spawn proof?? That way you don't ever have to worry about the mob spawns until you're ready!"
1,Bro when she talked about when she was a smaller channel I remembered when she was in college 😂 Gem is life
0,Loved the last one. Will love this one!   Does anyone have a very very close version of this for bedrock?!  I've tried so many and they just don't match up well.
0,It as been such a long time since the last one block!❤ don’t forget to hide the animals from the artic fox!
0,kinda based
0,too bad you got rid of the facecam. you also never finished your other series. i think it was the hardcore one? and also a skyblock one? anyways. i like your solo vids. :)
0,"Gem breaking down and rebuilding her house reminds me of Pearl in Hermitcraft season 8 taking down her whole (finished, mind you) house to turn it 90°"
0,Name one pig bacon and the other bits lol
0,14:58 Ummm… Gem you’ve literally got sheep. Make a bed!
0,I love you
0,Had to rewatch both one block series first and now that that is done I am watching the new video

0,"i love how chill and silly your one block series is and your commentary is great!  Its nice to see some more solo content on the main channel, dont get me wrong i love the videos with hermitcraft/ giggs just as much but its just nice to see you doing a second one block series this and your stardew videos are some of my favorite ! I cant wait for the arena and everything else to come this is awesome !"
0,Im so excited that it's back!
0,ugh okay fine you've convinced me to play skyblock haha :P
0,**cough** still waiting for hardcore ep 7 **cough** **cough**
0,"I'm really sick right now and this is the exact kind of video I needed to lift my spirits a little, thanks so much Gem ♥"
0,"""i have no way to make torches""
charcoal: am i a joke to you?"
0,"I want this exact version, but I can't figure out which to download... I've got a couple and none are like yours!?!"
0,Oh my god I am so excited! I’ve been binging all the solo series so I’m really glad you’re making another!! :D
0,Gaahh!! I love your one block series! I’m so excited for this one <3
0,"I remember watching the old skyblock series while I was doing online school during the covid era. Crazy to think that that was only 3-4 years ago, and how much you've done since then. <3"
0,we're so back!!!!!!!
0,When the pig dies in 2025 4 years ago the same thing happened but with a chicken who remembers😅
0,heck yeah
0,"The one block series was the reason i found you Gem!! I'm so happy to get to experience it again, thank you!❤"
0,Woooo! I love watching skyblock

0,"Btw, thanks Gem for uploading in 4k! Pass the message along to the other hermits :)"
0,Facecam added so much to this series last time.
0,One Block is one of my favourite series you do! Glad to see it back!
0,"hey gem just a heads up, when u get to the phase that can give you spruce it will also spawn foxes and wolves which will kill your animals if u leave the block for them to get in. I speak from unfortunate experience lol. so excited to keep watching this series!! <3"
0,Yeeeeees here we go again!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
0,Well hello Gem. I am so glad to get to see you making a new One Block again. I was hopping you would of worked on your other one block. this is just as good. Glad you shared the One Block for us as well to play. thank you. see you again on your neck video. & the rabbits can jump 2 blocks high. you might want to put the rabbits in a cage. Good luck hope they do not kill them self.
0,"It’s funny, Gem has two modes.
#1: Solo Gem; calm and happy.
#2*: SMP Gem; stressed and annoyed.

*Conditions apply, primarily, Grian."
0,Love this! Look how far you've come since your old Skyblock
0,Everytime a mob popped out it scared me. I love that you threw you ax at the creeper. I wish we had throwing axes in Minecraft
0,"Seeing you trying to build with such a limited palette made me think how interesting it would be to have a guess the build, but you need to collect all the supplies for the build in a survival world. Just include a segment before each build where each person has a certain amount of time for gathering blocks. (Also, I thoroughly love your Skyblock content. I am in no way saying that you should be doing something else. Just an idea that popped in my head.)"
0,i'm so happy your starting up again i've always loved this series
0,made me laugh when even the hermits realize that hermitcraft starter houses are an entirely differnt breed of starter lol.
0,yay mushroom cows!!! i wasn’t around for your first one-block series so i’ll need to go back and watch them. this looks super fun!
1,Your first one block skyblock videos were the first of your I watched
0,I mean its easter and you get a lot of easter bunnos

0,My favourite now too. Started playing it because of you 😊
0,I love your Skyblock Series Gem from day one with I think it is 4 years ago feels nice to watch this nostalgic feeling while I build a Highland Village in survival.
0,Oooo so exciting! I'm using this map for my series too!

0,Hey Gem don't forget you can make charcoal with wood so you can make torches
0,"Omg, so excited that you decided to re-run! I wanted to see what ended up happening with the last island"

0,I was in love with your original one block series! I’m so glad it’s making a come back!!
0,proud to say i’ve was around for gems og one block series
0,Been watching since that vid haha!
1,"As someone who only plays Minecraft on my phone, I got a one block thingy off the marketplace, and the first animal it spawned was a silverfish that knocked me into the void every time I respawned and I lost everything I had. So I feel like one block isn’t for me 😂"
0,"The pig: I feel more comfortable and safer standing on dirt because it's a full block. Those slabs are scary.
The sapling on the dirt, growing into a tree: Safer, huh?"
0,I loved the first one hope this one will be even better❤
0,"The only time I've played one block, I fell off the edge with the only water bucket before I started a farm, didn't make a pen for my sheep before wolves spawned and killed them, and then became overrun by pandas and polar bears, because for some reason it only gave me the two sheep to start with, but pandas and polar bears _wouldn't stop spawning_

...I'm not good at this. You're much better. I'll just watch you."
9,"Your one block series was actually the first minecraft series I watched on youtube after playing since 2010! And it led me to Hermitcraft, which made me change the way I play Minecraft, which made me change the way I live my actual life in the same way! So I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm excited for this one just as much! ❤"
0,"Yay, love One Block 😁"
0,Don’t forget that the oneblock does have a nether phase in the future 😅 might have to upgrade your house to avoid it from burning up!
0,You should eventually build a castle!!
0,WOOOO

0,"I’M SO EXCITED FOR THIS SERIES!!!! Your past ones have been amazing and my favorite MineCraft to watch, so thank you for making another one."
10,"I loved the original one block series! I'm excited to see you make a new one!

Also don't forget that charcoal exists. You can use your trees to make infinite torches. For all I know you've already remembered this though."
0,"Love this series keep it up gem, thank you for the joy you brought us 😊"
0,Cottagecore Queen doing the cottages never disappoints
0,the animal crossing music makes me happy. You should record animal crossing for your second channel:D
0,Déjà vu here I come
0,I REMEMBER THE OG SERIES I WATCHED IT W MY BROTHERS
0,"Amazing video can’t wait to see how you build up this world! I’d love to see it all fully decorated with great ideas and builds. I loved your last one block series and all your builds throughout the whole channel they’re always my dream builds, not to mention your great personality and vibes 🩵"
0,❤
0,this was my favorite series i am so happy
0,"Yeah, Gem! Do more of this pls!"

0,WE'RE SO BACK
0,No way the original series was that long ago😨
0,Ogs remember the first series!
4,"16:15 yeah....yeeted my good pickaxe into lava in the nether that way before.
excited to see where you go with this!"
1,More one block... I must be dreaming--
0,"When I played this exact version, I lost all my gear to a guardian. I think how you're starting this is better than how I did (I do it in block by block with bridges, not circles)"
0,Loved the first one!
0,"Yes. I have indeed panicked so hard I threw my axe. It's like shock button pressing or something. I also use my axe to fight instead of having to save space for a sword, so it's especially vexing."
0,"Me the whole first 5 minutes: LET THE GRASS SPREAD!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Too bad it starts on a Plains biom. Seeing the new warm or cold variants would be fun. Maybe the next update can change the kind of eggs it gives you to be the brown and -blue- green ones.

The cozy vibes are some wholesome. Then suddenly Creeper! 😅😅😅

That's a nice little cottage. Here's hoping you can get glass soon. Mud would definitely fit in nicely with the aesthetic you've got going."
0,Loved this!!!!!!!
1,"3:27 And that's why we call them pigs.
Joke."
1160,"16:10 ""Do you ever just panic so hard that you press Q?""

Yep, that's I how learnt that, while Netherite tools are inmune to lava, they are NOT inmune to Creeper explosions :)"
0,"This is probably my favorite series, the first one inspired me to start my own one block world!! I can’t wait for the rest of it!!"
0,Happy to see you doing more solo series! I love the SMPs but your solo series are so cozy to me.
0,"LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, CHAT ARE WE HYPED OR ARE WE HYPED?!?!??!!?!?!??!?!?!"
0,"Keep an eye on those animals, eventually foxes and wolves spawn. Those will kill your chickens and sheep."

0,idk what it is about skyblock oneblock but i am so productive while watching this series
0,IM SO EXCITED FOR ANOTHER SKYBLOCK SERIES!!!!!!!! i loved the others and ik ill love these too XD
0,"I absolutely love one block, but I hate the monster parties. I always die 20 times every monster party, mainly cuz I'm bad."
0,Omg I remember watching the original years ago! So happy it’s back!
0,💚💚💚
0,So calm and fun as always Gem!
0,"One thing that I love about slaps, is that hostile mobs don't spawn on them at all. Well unless that's been changed this update"
0,So excited for this series!😄
0,One block was the first series I watched from you and ive adored u ever since!!! Im hyped
0,YEEEES! I loved the original oneblock and I'm happy to see it back! The original playlist got recommended to me one day and I ended up watching a few more of yours series. Your videos are great and I hope to see more ^_^
0,HIIIEAEAEAEAEAEEAEAEA
0,"I have never played Minecraft one block or skyblock before. But I want to try it, got any tips?"

0,Yay I’m so excited I love your one block sky block series ❤
0,almost 2 million subscribers is insane gem! im so happy for you !! x
0,16:10 1: no. My panic usually involves a flail. 2: I moved drop item to T for just this sort of thing.
8,"Love your content. I found you after watching fwhip and I love your energy! So excited for another skyblock series, I can tell you really enjoy it. 

One note with that Mushroom. You do not need to wait for podzil to farm it. I have a 'mushroom farm' in my storage/brewing/enchanting/lava farm/ dripstone farm/portal/mine entrance/wolf den/axolotol pool basement room. It's crazy. I started on just dirt, but they also grow on stone, and both types of nylium as well as they do on podzil. Bottom line, unless you want the giant ones, you can multiply either the red or the brown musrooms on basically any 'soil' block and more."
0,"one block skyblock was literally my gateway to becoming a geminitay enthusiast, soooooo so so so excited to see you back in the sky :')"
0,i rember waiting for the episodes to come out for the first one block and now i can do it again 3 years later
0,"Ohhh yes, a return of skyblock!"
0,yay skyblock!!
1,Another oneblock!
0,"I wish she continued the no passive mobs dies same with the previous series. 

The pig dying doesn't count as it was a total accident, though could've been avoided, but it is what it is."
0,yayyy i miss one block series so muchh
0,Whoo!
0,More please!!!
0,"YAY! New One Block! I loved your old series. I binged watched the whole thing and learned so much. I have played Minecraft since around 2012-2013, but really got into it after 2020, when my son was older and we played a lot, thousands of hours, but I had only ever played survival Vanilla.

I liked your series so much. It was the first time I played any kind of ""modded"" variation. It is so fun. I may just make a one block now to go alongside the series."
0,so excited for this series!!
0,"this was so fun!!! i had a great time watching. i love your original oneblock series, so excited to see it come back!!!"
0,"Sky block one block hardcore was the series that introduced me to your channel and I remember sitting down everyday excited to watch an episode! This is so cool that you are bringing it back now, I can’t wait to watch along and I wish you luck! 💕"

0,i think you can feed dandelions to the mushroom and it will give you saturation stew (6 hunger bars)
0,"Gem, pls start a new survival series!! The new updates are so you!!"
0,yay Gem one block series! :D
0,It’s been 5 Years since the first skyblock series?? How time flies🥹 Can’t wait to watch this one!

0,I'm stealing that fireplace for my world...super cute!

YOU'RE AMAZING GEM!!!"
2,imagine finish a series before you start a new one....

0,Yay! More Gem Skyblock!
0,Now I feel like I also have to play one block
0,Can't wait to see what you build out of the New Pale Oak or maybe the Mangrove wood
0,I love one block series so much and I'm happy to see my favorite YouTuber playing it
0,skyblock!!!
0,Loving this start! Just watching you build with limited resources like this really helps inspire me with my builds and get ideas - cos i suck at building and texturing myself ':D
0,YAYYYYY love this series so excited to watch!!!
0,this is exactly the kinda cozy video i needed today! cant wait to see what you do with your island <3
0,You can use dandelions to move the bunnies!
3,"Hi Gem, I love these series so much can't wait for this new one! An idea to not get hit by surprise mobs is to mine the block under a trapdoor! Love this vid!"
0,I played along with you last time you played Oneblock and now I feel like playing along again 🤗🤗
0,"I LOVED the og series, I’m so excited for this!!"
0,and now one block makes me think of Doc and the court
0,LETS GOOOOO
0,"Wow a new Gem Skyblock series!  I’m so excited, I’ve watched all your skyblock series so many times!"
0,14:53 “Gem and the Space Rats” sounds like the perfect band name for Gem and the Arizona dads
0,THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY GREAT!
1,11:29 the flashbacks i just got to one of the original series with the chicken xD
0,I havent watched hermitcraft in a long time started getting clips of you and impulse just talking in my recommended and decided to watch all your hermitcraft 10 videos almost cought up
1,YAYAYAYYYYYYY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
0,"I have a suggestion ☝️ I have seen this on many one block playthroughs. They expand tbeir bases using the lower half of tbe slab to prevent mobs from spawning, it saves a bunch of torches if you dont mind the darkness. Also you should smelt logs to make charcoal for early game renewable fuel."
0,I recently found you with your old sky block series
1,The creeper panic was REAL lol I felt it through the screen! XD
1,"11:28 Seeing that, I can only think about Cleo in 3rd life O_O"
1,"This is the video that has pushed me over the edge and subbed me to you. I loved the life series stuff, and the guess the build, and now this series is joining those! I'm normally very careful with my subscriptions nowadays but you have earnt it.
Much love from the UK <3"
0,You should build an area for the Mooshroom in the house for food supply.

3,"Love the series, but I caution you to think about protecting your sheep and chickens soon as the foxes and wolves will spawn and kill them all 😅"
0,i havent played minecraft for a while i didnt know they updated the mushroom cow textures  they look so much cuter with that single pixel shine in their eyes ^__^
0,You don’t understand the scream I scrumpt when I saw the notification
0,"GEMMMMMMM!!!!


THE FIRST VIDEO OF ANY HERMITCRAFTER I EVER WATCHED WAS YOUR ORIGINAL MINECRAFT SKYBLOCK SERIES when i was like NINE years old (well that was after i was watching when i was like two but then i forgot about it etc)


Be glad you didnt hear my *scream* of joy when i saw this, at first i thought it was reccomended to me from all those years ago, but its NEW???

Ive rewatched all of your skyblock series basically every time im sick, or having a bad day… oneblock is my absolute favorite series, and the REASON i got into hermitcraft, which has changed my life forever. I cant describe in words how much i loved this series in the past and how excited i am. I might tear up."
0,"SO excited to see your own excitement here with one block. Very special map / pack, and it’s so cool to see the planning and grinding that goes into these amazing one block worlds. 

And to hear you’re really committed to this one - really stoked to see where you take it!! Letsgooooo"
0,the minute i saw this i though lemme rewatch it but then I SAW THE DATE
0,"Never seen a tree suffocate a pig, very nice"
0,"I love this!! The editing is very pleasant for me (I have ADHD) and engaging, can't wait for more!"
0,4 hours ago! HOW DARE YOUTUBE HIDE THIS FROM ME FOR 4 HOURS👹
9,19:38 The Hermitcraft 8 fans are deeply saddened to see that your love for birch has waned...

0,WE ARE SO BACK!!!
1,That one tree is clearly not vegan
0,Day 1 people? Btw LOVE these series'
0,"I always forget how long it's actually been since I subbed to gem... I think I subbed on the tail end of her creative build era...witch was a while ago, I believe"
0,GEM I LOVE when you do one block.😁😁 Im so exited. I have seen all ur one/skyblock vids.
0,"Is there any chance of continuing the Hardcore Series as well, even later on so that you don't have a thousand different ones all at the same time? I absolutely loved it!"
0,oh my god was the last series that long ago?! Am I getting old?
0,I adore your skyblock series. Your prior one block was how I found your series.
0,"IM HOOKED, so excited about Oneblock Skyblock Season 2"

0,Yayayay!! Thank you for posting this! I love when you play oneblock!!!!!<33
1,"I will never understand why people build up a skyblock island using slabs...on the top half of the block.  Why are you making a giant, unlit spawning space?!  Put the slabs on the lower half and you won't get hostile mobs at night, even without lighting.  It's unbelievably common to see people do slabs for extra space, because it's more resource efficient, but then to build in the *most dangerous way* they possibly could."
0,so excied for this series! i love skyblock!
0,"Just finished your sky block series from a few years ago, what great timing!!!"

0,"Stupid question, but how does one pay one block/skyblock on Java?"
0,"I am so happy to wake up to this, the og series was probably my favorite you've done. (Also is it just me but I swear it was not that long since the old one block series)"

0,"Hey Gem, I’ve been hearing a lot about Minecraft Forever Worlds, so will you make this your One Block Forever World?"
0,"Yeahh, I love skyblock one block !!"
0,"I love this! One Block was how i found your channel and eventually discovered Hermitcraft when you joined. I liked the sound of impulses voice in the first episode during all the ""behind you, Gem"" stuff😂 and little by little i found the creators of Hermitcraft to be my own friends. Thank you, Gem, for opening up this world to me! I cant wait to watch this, and i will be starting my own so I can play alongside you🥰 I'm truly grateful for you❤"
0,What a great day.
0,You are telling me I could’ve watched this 3 hours ago?!
0,Oh… yayyyyyy
1,THIS IS SO EXITING! and actually I've never panicked so hard I hit 'q'
3,I just started watching this channel and I watched all of your first Skyblock one blocked challenge and was sad I finished it. Now a week ish later you're restarting it!!!
0,"Oh my gosh, another Gem vid!! Chattt we're being spoiled!!! 💜💜💜💜"
0,Finally. Another old series I can binge watch for the next few hours. Wait. Why did that leaf fell from the tree? Thats the new feature. When did that video come out??? § HOURS??? Okay no binge watching for me then. The internet gods decided my fate XD

0,Yay! I really love this chill content!
0,So good I love your videos
0,"hey gem nice episode i think it woud be relly cool to make a restaurant or a streat vender where  u keep all the food and crops that u have also it woud be vary cool if it turnd multy player : ) 

just to note ur content is great and its cool to see it happen again ( one block that is ) : )"
0,Fingers crossed that they added pale oak and cherry
0,"""Ever just panic so hard you press Q?"" All the time."
0,Im hoping this video does well because I want more skyblock content.
0,Omg. Your amazing last oneblock series made me watch Hermitcraft afterward and addicted to at least 5 of you. And now we are back to the beginning ❤
0,I thought you beat one block the last time. The last video in your playlist says finale. Or was that a different type of one block skyblock?
0,Yay! I'm so excited! One thing I'd recommend is to build an aquarium under the block so that a) if you fall you fall in water and b) when you get to the ocean phase you can just let the animals fall into the aquarium and not worry about them dying
0,Hello there
3,Your old one block serious was probably one of the main reason i gained a love for minecraft. Seeing you re do it has given me sm nostalgia
0,I feel bad for the poor charcoal  .. created by Mojang to bring light into just this type of a situation and yet always being forgotten by  'professional' minecrafters when doing skyblocks ...  😥
