1,"Hi, Lydia! I think I've got all the necessary basics now and thanks to you can put them together in nice outfits. However, and I totally agree with you here, it's how we 'season' those base outfits with the right accessories that actually gives our look a major lift. And it's here that I struggle the most now. Accessories are a true minefield: it's so easy to overdo them and ruin everything, or sometimes they are there but don't work for some reason :( Lydia, do you think you could come up with some 'algorithm' for using accessories in the right way? I suspect it's largely very creative and intuitive, but maybe there's  a chance to create at least some base level   'manual' of this sort for beginners? 🙏",0.813

2,"Lovely Lydia, I am absolutely thrilled to see you doing so well! Your latest collection is stunning and although at my age I don’t go out anywhere near as much as I used to I did rush to buy the gorgeous pleated full skirt as I think it will look as fabulous in autumn with lace up boots and a fancy knitted top as it will in spring and summer. Having said that, I have asked to be notified when your yellow shift dress comes online, so ya never know. 😂
Seriously, I’ve watched you go from strength to strength over the past few years and it makes me so happy to see you succeeding in the fashion industry, which is not easy. It’s clear to me that fashion is where your passion is and boy, do you know how to make simple, classic lines stand out with your thoughtful, classy style.  Keep going love, push forward, onwards and upwards. I feel fabulous in the pieces of yours that I have bought in the past and I’m sure that I won’t be disappointed this year.  ( The white backless dress is also on my mind.)
Take care and thanks for making me a very happy retiree. ❤",0.9962

1,I bought some items from last summer collection and still very happy with it. Skipped the winter collection as the fabrics were mostly synthetic which I hate. Glad to find out that this collection has some more cotton or linen. To be honest I liked the previous one more as this one is a bit too much for me but ordered to check some items anyway. The silver buttons look very cheap to me ( sorry) but if I like the top I’ll see if I can replace them. Would like you to show some more styling options for those beige ones.,0.909

0,"You are ready for the Hamptons. I visited Bar Harbor, Maine and would highly recommend visiting. The looks you have presented are all amazing. My favorite is the polo top and the Bermuda linen shorts. I have six pairs of Bermuda linen shorts and find them so easy to style in the summer months. I love the watch you are wearing when you paired the polo top and shorts. What brand is that watch? Thanks for another fabulous video, Lydia.",0.9816

But the fact that they had a location tab for US gives me a shimmer of hope. 😊",0.9325
2,Lovely styles! My favorite part is how comfortable and practical they all look. I find that typical summer styles can be so impractical and uncomfortable. Like super tight short shorts and skirts are so terrible and we’ve been gaslit that they are comfortable even tho you can’t even sit in them. I need leather flip flops like those!

Unfortunately, after two surgeries on my shoulders, I have scars that I don’t want to show so I prefer  some kind of cover on my upper arms - they’ve lost muscle and the scars show more when I have a tan . Ditto those shorts which I don’t find flattering on anyone ? 
I can see that the fabrics are lovely and they look great with neutral and bright accessories . 
Also , having worked in London , I’d definitely avoid light colours because you really do feel grimy by the end of a working day so I wouldn’t wear them for sightseeing in the city - you certainly couldn’t rewear them after a punishing day in the city .",0.9107

I love small, unobtrusive polka dots and it’s hard to beat a crisp, white shirt or top. Classic white tops really elevate any outfit.
You didn’t cover my pet hate - those ugly, crotch-at-the-knee, very baggy, ankle snatched pants that squeeze their way into the shops each year. In my youth we called them MC Hammer pants.

I try to tell my aunti and momma to maybe try something more conservatively fashioned because it looks more elegant and like you’re not trying to hang onto youth becuz in my country it’s like we idolize youth and flinch at aging.  I guess I might sound stuffy like a grandma but I feel like what I see is obvious to the eye. I’m 15 years old and my mom will wear my tops.

I am not a flouncy, floral girl.  At 6ft tall I enjoy looking striking and dressing with a classic bend.  I wore the parachute decades ago and still have a Laura Kim skirt that I wear whenever I like ironically with an asymmetrical ivory top.  A short polka dot look is a must for summer for me, all bought years ago.  I once wore a knotted dress on the runway at FIT graduating class and one of the knots failed over the chest flashing Bill Clinton, he commended my walk backstage so no harm done!

5,As a woman in her late 60s I don’t think of boho as floral prints and crochet……it’s more a loose casual look.   In the 70s boho was wider legged pants and loose tops.   I never wear floral or ruffles…..it was never in my boho repertoire.  I still love this look….classic isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.,0.6893
1,"Good morning Lydia.

I agree with what you are saying with regard to logos. I think in an outfit they are completely unsightly. What say you?

I love asymmetrical clothing. It adds something a little bit different and makes an outfit much more interesting.

I have four main rules to my outfits and closet. They are as follows:

1. No hoodies or jogging bottoms.
2. No gym or athleisure wear.
3. Where white trainers that are actually clean. Nothing worse than white trainers that's left to become dirty or grubby.
4. No graphic Tees or tops.

I personally have a two colour rule for any outfit. I tend to stick to basics. Like a basic t-shirt. Vest AKA tank tops. Basic plain button down shirt. Plain white trainers with minimal logos over them.

Lydia. What is your opinion of double denim and what is your opinion on my basic rules?

I love polka dots and Stripes. Also I like leopard and animal print. What is your view on the forementioned? Have you got any animal print in your closet? I love playing striped button down shirts add pinstripe suit sets. Could you please produce a video Lydia about how to style prints and patterns? Because you can go so wrong with styling the above.

Lydia. I love your content and you always look so classy along with looking sophisticated. Your partner is one Lucky young man. You are one very classy looking young lady that dresses so well.

Lydia. Thank you very much for all your great content here on your YouTube channel.

What is your opinion on either thrift flipping and altering your own clothing?

Do you own a sewing machine and would you alter or transform any outfit into something new?

I look forward to your reply regarding all my questions.

Regards pure.",0.9952

Having the choice which we feel represents us and makes us feel happy and comfortable gives us the freedom to wear what we want. Fashion is so personal - it depends on so many factors - silhouette, characteristics, taste, finances and how one spends their daily life. I don’t really care what’s ‘in’ or ‘ on trend’- I just buy what I like and feel confident in whatever that may be.",0.9721
1,"I do not wear the flouncy dresses, but they do look good on some ppl depending on their body type. But I always wear a soft floral dress in lighter months. With these dresses you can by pass the big chunky earrings which cause so much pain in the ear lobes considering I’m not even getting any younger! 😅

Comfort is such a priority for me. I have always gravitated to small to mid size jewelry.


Jelly shoes…unsure! But no judgement here…❤


But all in all I realize you have to find your personal style that suits you, you feel comfortable in and works well in your lifestyle than just blindly copying/ following others. I do love women with individual styles. ❤

LOVE your videos!😍 Hope you can help me decide on the sizes of a few pairs of Flattered shoes I’m currently looking at. I’m a half size like you and not sure I should size up or down with these shoes. Would you please provide some insights in the sizes of the Belinda Suede Black, the Bon Bon and the Bodil that you also owned. I had tried on the size US 6 last year but feel very slightly snug. I didn’t have a chance to wear it in as it’s a defect pair and returned it. Just wondering if the Bodil loosen quite a bit after a few wears? Thank you for your help!🙏🏼",0.9578
