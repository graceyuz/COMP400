1,"Love the causal looks. I would love to see more videos like this. I’m a stay at home mom so doing school drop-off/pick up and lots of after school activities. Blazers are not practical as much I love them (and have lots of them from my work days), so I’d love to see more casual practical pieces being styled (hope that make sense). Love your videos and your style ❤"
0,"10:37 - Love this cardigan. Reminds me of the popular Khaite cardigan that was so popular a few seasons ago. 
14:32 - Great look to add a same color cardigan as a layering piece. Love navy blue!
Another thing I want to add to these basics with a twist is the &Other Stories top. It's the Draped Asymmetric T-shirt. Recently purchased it in white, but there are other colors too! Selling out quickly!"
1,I absolutely love your basics video! They are so inspirational!
0,I love the pair of sunglasses. What is the brand and model no?
4,Yes please more casual recommendations… 90 percent of my life is casual and errands…
2,"These day to day casual looks are wonderful...and so helpful.  I love your style, Lydia, and it is great to see your talent out to these casual looks."
4,I’m so disappointed that these pieces don’t size beyond a large.  What do you recommend for size inclusive options?
0,I just found out that ASOS carries a small selection of Arket. Shipping worldwide.
13,"Lydia, my 7 y/o watched you for the first time and this video. She loved all the looks, asked me, ""is this where you get that idea from"" 😊 and mentioned how pretty you are 😊."
0,"So wish Arket would ship orders to the United States. I've messaged them several times but they will not. Maybe...Lydia you could influence sway Arket to do so? They would have a strong market in the U.S.  

And if you would influence COS and other brands to offer larger sizes to  EU 46 or 48...US 16 and 18.  There's a whole market of larger sized women in the world 🌎   Not all of us wear size Small/Medium.  If you noticevin your own Nakd collections the size 44 sells out quickly.  A Size 46 and 48 are needed!"
0,"Ohhhhh I wish they'd ship to US, any alternative suggestions? Especially for the barrel leg jeans."
1,"I like that the t shirts have a bit “longer” short sleeve, which is nice and I found it more attractive. Especially after a particular age, when you feel, that your arms are not necessarily the best features to showcase. Nice collection! Thank you."
5,"I love barrel jeans - they are extremely flattering if you get that ""just right"" shape. I also love the Khaite inspired cardigan. I love the casual looks. Thank you, Lydia!"
0,I loved everything!
2,Love all these outfit formulas even though we don't get Arket here in the states. That slim cardigan is lovely.  I will have to get more long sleeve cotton Tees. I especially like the look when you put the navy cardigan over the tees.
0,Consider a video to prepare for winter 2025.
4,Love these casual looks! Where I live these kind of outfits will be great to transition to fall when temps go down a little. At this time we have mid 90s F° so we are all wearing sleeveless tops and trousers in lightest weight linen. Just the thought of a sweater makes me wish I lived in the UK! 🫠😋
1,I like everything you showed.
1,Please use brands available in the USA. Thanks.
30,"I am 5ft 1/2 inch tall and my pair of barrel pants that I purchased last year are one of my favorite silhouettes on me. I wear them on repeat with many different tops. At my stage in life (68 years old), I prefer my styles to be more relaxed and comfortable with a bit of structure as you are showing here. I recently purchased a pair of ""summer"" brown suede ballet flats and I can't wait to wear them. You are such a fabulous styling inspiration."
5,Very practical help. Thank you Lydia. I might even give barrel jeans another try.
1,Bravo Bravo Bravo
2,Great ideas for real everyday life ❤
0,"COS has great quality, too. So great to have middle range brands that still do great quality affordable."
7,I’d love more comfy and casual for those of us who want to look smart but have little ones!

2,"“I saw Cady Haron wearing jogging pants and flip-flops, so I brought jogging pants and flip-flops “"
4,Oooh the navy cardigan is a classic winner!😎
0,Absolutely love this!!!
0,I struggle trying to choose the right bag to add to my wardrobe! Especially as I'm still building my wardrobe and don't have much. I tend to always lean black but I'm trying to branch out into other colors.
0,"I really enjoyed seeing you going through the whole process of deciding whether it works or not. Great video , as always. thank you!"
0,I seriously dislike the light coloured jeans this time.   It’s colour and shape.
0,Ditto about loving the way you styled these capsule pieces by adding the right color and textures to add pizazz ❤
0,I looove your style and how you show us how to style basics!!!!!
0,"Hi Lydia, what do you think about small understated handbag charms? Like a gold initial or simple chain with a medallion? They are very popular in the southern part of the US and in California, especially worn with a plain classic leather handbag that has no pattern or statement logo. Thanks if you can answer!!😊"
0,This was a great style of video. Loved all the looks. Have you shown any outfits with a triangle silk scarf tied at the waist. I would love to see you styling that look. ❤🎉

0,Usefull video! I would love more videos like this <3
1,Love this video. And that white maxi tee shirt dress.

0,Its like watching the thought process of an artist. Thank you for sharing!
0,I enjoyed the format of this video very much where you took us along as you thought through how you put together the outfit and let us see sort of the bts of your thought process. It felt like I was in the room with a friend helping to put together an outfit. It’s also helping to see how you think through your decisions.
2,This video really shows the power of accessories indeed! Thanks for making it so easy to see. Unfortunately it also gives a feeling that one needs like many pairs of scrappy sandals and  many various leather flip flops 😅
5,Love the thought process you go through as you say it out loud 👍
0,Love this style of video! More please!
0,Very useful! Thank you!
2,Classy ladies never touch their hair ....
8,"Loved this video, please do lots more of these! I Would love a video, where you style the same base layer for different occasions by adding different accessories."
23,"This is golden! Hearing you thinking out loud, trying on things, disregarding them, swapping them out and seeing it all come together is how we can learn ourselves how styling works. Love!"
3,"Yes, great video format; I can understand that the thinking out loud process might not appeal to everybody, but I actually thought it was quite good. Works for me!"

1,Love your styling videos ❤
0,"The sunglasses crack me up. She has at least l20 options, worth tens of thousands of dollars. And that’s just sunglasses. Not going to lie- a little jealous!"
0,"Lydia, with your slim body figure, your height, and your loong legs, EVERYTHING looks gorgeous on YOU......

But on my 5'2"", VERY curvy pear 😅 shape, and short legs  NOTHING looks good!!

Loose/wide legs pants make me look shorter, and bulky 
And fitted pants/skirts/dresses make me look vulgar 🤒🤒"
52,I loooove these videos where you style basics or capsule basic pieces because these are what people actually tend to wear on a day to day. They're more realistic. It makes me so exited for my wardrobe ❤❤. Please keep it up. Love these vids
1,Just some cool accessories is all it needs.  Easy peasy.
0,I love this style of video! Very helpful

0,1M .... coming soon
6,Love this!!!  So very helpful; I love hearing your thoughts while styling an outfit.  I also loved the spectrum of dressy to casual this video covered.  Thanks for the educational video.
16,"Can you give us a tour through your accessories? All Footwear, bags, jewellery, sunglasses, belts, scarves and hat/caps ??
Would really appreciate it 😊"
10,"This was very useful info for me. Styling is like the artistic part of dressing, and it doesn't just 'happen'! 👒"
0,"Love this type of video, more please!"
6,"My favourite type of content!  Thank you,  Lydia.  I also love one base layer, multiple ways to style! 🤍"
1,"Hi, Lydia! I think I've got all the necessary basics now and thanks to you can put them together in nice outfits. However, and I totally agree with you here, it's how we 'season' those base outfits with the right accessories that actually gives our look a major lift. And it's here that I struggle the most now. Accessories are a true minefield: it's so easy to overdo them and ruin everything, or sometimes they are there but don't work for some reason :( Lydia, do you think you could come up with some 'algorithm' for using accessories in the right way? I suspect it's largely very creative and intuitive, but maybe there's  a chance to create at least some base level   'manual' of this sort for beginners? 🙏"
2,I think you are on track with this style video. I have built my basics with your help so ideas of switch a roo are perfect
2,"I really like the video! Loving watch the process of how you actually style the outfit and your toughts behind it.
Wanna see more content like this 💜"
7,I would love to see your take for casual elevated for office. After working at home for 14 years I am starting in a corporate environment and I am struggling to leave my casual pants: cant really see me in a suit and heels. What would Lydia do? 😳
22,"LOVE this video, and LOVE hearing the process out loud, many more videos in this format please ☺️"
1,"Yes pls, I love these tutorial type videos ❤"
0,"Great advice, very helpful."
18,"Thank you, Lydia!  This video was so helpful!  It’s so valuable to learn the thinking that goes into your styling and accessorizing.  It excels at illustrating why a look just seems a little off and how one small tweak, like different sunglasses or bag, can make it all come together.  More like this please!❤"
1,Loved this Lydia. More please!
0,Do you buy one oe two sizes bigger in jeans than your normal pant size? What size are the AF jeans? Thank you for the style ideas; they are basic and attractive.
2,Really love the video. Love to hear how you chose your accessoires. Thank you!
3,"Very useful tips for a minimalist like me, the best video as usual ❤❤❤"
5,Thank you  for this video!   Watching you put the outfits together and hearing your thought process was wonderful!
6,"I love the combinations and accessories you chose! I'm wondering about the clutch purses, however. Perhaps it goes back to my own history, but it seems so easy for someone to snatch your clutch if it's only held under your armpit. It's a shame that this needs to be a consideration because your beautiful bags really complement your outfits."
2,"Hi Lydia,,
I find by using basics, that I am putting together so many more outfits and then
 choosing different accessories, it makes for so many different looks."
0,Love your videos Lydia...Bravissima ❤
0,"Thank you so much Lydia, love the video and your styling x"
3,"Wow u have a lovely wardrobe. All stuff in the closet is neatly stacked, folded, color coded and also hanged."
1,👍👍👍👍
2,"U prolly spend a lot of money on Style. Your wardrobe is having tons of accessories, shoes, bags and clothes in the closet. And they seem the latest trend. So v lucky to be spoilt for choice. To top it your hairdo is definitely well groomed with keratin and highlights. I guess Style is expensive"
3,Love these type of videos 😍
3,I really enjoyed watching your process of putting an outfit and accessories together. So helpful!
13,"OMG How many white jackets and dresses u have at the back. Imagine so much variety in 1 color,  so how gigantic must be ur wardrobe."
0,I guess if I was slim and fit anything would look good. Show me how to transform a fat frumpy middle aged and not a skinny one.
2,Bravo Bravo Bravo Bravo Bravo!!!!!!!!!
38,"Love your basics videos like this one. I can’t get enough, so yes, please do more! SO helpful!"
11,Accessories make an amazing difference to every outfit. I love your ideas.

8,I love to see your creative process! At this point I hear your voice in my head while I’m putting together outfits 😂
0,I love your athletic feet and ankles! How beautiful! Oh my God! You are beautiful! 🥰😍😘

0,Great video! I had same video idea in mind haha
0,Any decisions on wedding dresses?
0,"Brilliant again Lydia, I’ve learnt so much from you and now have a capsule wardrobe that works while I travel and live in South Korea.  It works for all seasons and what ever I reach for looks good with everything else and I can be out the door feeling really good about my outfit in a really short time. Thanks heaps! Oh yes, this way of thinking has also helped me stop impulse buying. I can now resist beautiful (but not quite my style) or gorgeous (but not needed) clothes, which I could never do before!"
0,My most favorite video🌝 Thank you so much- great job!!!🫶
0,"Love the concept of this video, and loved how you styled the items! I do think the shorts were throwing things off slightly for me personally, they look like they're not fitted properly or something idk, they are a bit low and loose around the waist, maybe thats just me being uncool though ha."
0,All looks are perfect 👌
0,Love this! ❤
0,pretty lady with beautyfull feet
0,"Nice outfits 🙂 I liked the 1st ❤And what's your shoes size ? 
Because I have the impression we have the same shoes size 😁"
0,"Thank you for these videos Lydia! I recently found your account and I love the message that you give about investing in good basics and atemporary pieces. I started to apply your advices and I recently bought something a little bit pricey but worth it! (it's a spanish brand called Adolfo Dominguez, maybe you've heard of it). Anyway, thanks again!"
0,"LOVE this video! 😇🥰🫠 Lately, I've been noticing how a hat or head scarf can make us appear taller! It draws the eye all the way up, from the shoes to the top of the head. So this outfit with the head scarf is something I would definitely wear. Thanks Lydia, you know we love this type of video! 🩵💜💙🩵"

0,Yes!!! This is Lydia we all love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0,"Thank you so much Lydia, lovely video :)"
2,Older stylists 40+ are recommending beware the long short unless it just covers the knee
0,Thanks! Love the collarless blazer please link us to any you find in The future since this one is sold out thank you🎉
14,"All the 5 matching shoes and bags, accessories, jackets, tops are not from her minimalist tidy wardrobe behind. She has a lot of matching stuff kept in another wardrobe. Plus they are all latest in trends and looks brand new. What do we do if ours is a bit dated and used. Wont look so good."
0,"I’d love a shoe video, as you always seem to nail the shoes with every outfit Sx"
13,"Bravo! Lydia, you've been absolutely killing it recently! Soo happy our incredibly talented and creative Lydia who is teaching us to actually style our stuff rather than buy new one is back! 🥰"
8,"Thank you so much Lydia, very enjoyable and useful video!"
1,Bravo!!!
4,"6:45 I do love how you've utilized the scarf and tied it around your waist! It's very different and brings dimension! She has another similar styling video on her yt short called, ""Free Ways To Upgrade Your Style."""
24,Love this style of vids. They help with ideas. Please do more 😊. I really enjoyed this
0,I can't get on with those shorts. they remind me of what my mom wore in the 80s and even as a kid I remember telling that it made her look frumpy lol. a few inches shorter would be better imo
3,I love your Nakd collection! Thank you for the tips❤
4,I really like your dressing senses❤
0,Some good ideas ❤
0,"thanks so much for the video, very interesting, please continue the content 😊"
1,Really useful tips! Could you do something on when to wear silver and when to wear gold jewellery and accessories? I always struggle with this.

0,"Yes, the different color  palette u mention for neutrals like these darling ❤ especially Autumn Palette colors, tans, camels, beiges, browns, burgundies, greens etc I don’t wear black, white, navy etc xxxx🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️"
0,I love watching your videos! They give me great ideas and support the theory that classics never go out of style!
0,"Love so much your content! Could you please make a video on details/secrets that we should know? Like underwear colour X white clothes, bra’s styles and sizes X top’s styles, etc - would love to watch!"
0,"Luv these Outfits , so Versatile"
0,"Amazing, very helpfull. Love your style!"
0,More of this please!
15,"The too long pants trend... Well... Many of us ask themselves how you can keep the hem clean. I don't even ask myself this question, because there is only one explaination: you can keep them clean because you never wear them out of the house! You wear them only in front of a camera. These pants are made just for posing! 😂
And I suggest that Lydia gives once for all her opinion on this topic, after she must have read the question how she keeps the hem of these too long trousers clean about a million times. 🤔"
0,Très jolie.merci
0,"Yes, more please! 🙏🏼 love these videos! ❤"
1,The long trouser shorts are just not flattering on anyone. I think it ages any woman and makes the calves appear too thin.
0,Can you do a series on Kitten Heels?
0,From whr im based we wear as mentioned all here. Bcos we have rain and sunshine thru out 365 days. Its the colors that made a difference to our moods. Keep coming vids like this
0,Great tips🥰 Question please… I’m trying to put outfits together for Italy in August. What is appropriate attire for evening/dinner? Also… are open toe shoes appropriate for evening?
0,"Over the weekend,  I tied a colourful scarf across my shoulders on my white tee + black wide leg pants combo, and I felt gooood standing out. Practical also, because i get very nitpicky about ensuring that I get no stains all through the day.

Oversized everything is MY JAM"
0,"As always, Lydia, these are wonderfully educational videos. Thank you!"
0,Yes please more videos like this!! You have helped me tremendously 🙌
0,"I absolutely need videos like this! Amazing advice, never considered black leather bags for Summer but you are so right and my Chanel bag is now ready to go on holidays ❤"
3,"Yea, would love to see more of these kind of videos!"
14,"Allover oversize looks good only if you have relatively small chest. I have DD chest with the slimmer body, but if I wear that sort of an oversize top/dress, I look like a walking tent."
0,Would you wear a 3/4 silk blouse that’s formal (Tibi) with linen wide leg drawstring trousers - that’s a big juxtaposition!
1,aren't those white pants way too long? they literally touch the floor and would get awfully dirty real fast. Not a good look imo 🤷‍♀
0,🤍🤍🤍
1,I loathe with a vengeance this trend of putting a bag under your arm. Especially impractical in summer. Sometimes following trends it’s just so silly.
13,"Thank you for staying true to your style. After going through a tough period of emotional burnout, I lost my confidence and sense of fashion. Your videos helped me reconnect with myself and feel good in my clothes again. Truly grateful!"
0,Ta mais linda
0,These videos r helpful
3,The white trousers are too long
3,The wide leg pants are completely impractical and almost clownish.  Next year no one will be wearing these so IMO they’re a waste of money.   I like the blue dress that can be belted or not.
1,Those trousers look sloppier and sloppier 👎
0,❤❤❤
0,"Yes Lydia, love the return of this type of video 😃 my favourites are always these do/don’t and 1 item 5 ways 😃 And regarding the comments at the end - We know you have a wedding to plan - don’t worry! ❤"
0,"Alas, not to have a big bust!"
1,Love your content and style. Waiting for you to dress Mum again 🤗❤️🇦🇺
8,"Lydia, I love the length of your white wide leg pants, but how do you keep the bottoms clean? It drives me crazy to have them dirty in 5 sec"
4,Definitely do more of these! All of your Ideas are very helpful! As far as the oversized you look stunning in everything however I am only 5ft 2 inches and anything oversized makes me feel like I am drowning in fabric and it looks like I’m wearing a potato sack Not a flattering look haha !!!
0,"Yes please Lydia, this was a great and inspiring vlog. More please, they would be so useful. Diving into winter black and combining it with summer whites, genios ! and so chic and stylish.
Looking forward to your next styling video !
Thank you 😊"
0,"Love them 
Na-kd unfortunately is not shipped to Canada . Maybe you can push for that 😉"
5,Yes Lydia please more of these videos! Love the outfits you are creating with the different colors & material. 😊❤️
2,"Love all your content and ideas, I’ve learnt so much, but I do feel the trousers are too baggy and look to big on you, it’s the only look I’ve ever seen you wear that I’m not keen on"
1,Bravo Bravo. Yes please. Deep Dive Lydia😊
0,A we some of these don’t ship to the US
0,YES please do more I love all your knowledge
0,"I have used high-end imitation Rolex. The quality is good. Except for the fake diamonds, the workmanship and weight are the same as the real ones. I have worn it for many years without losing the paint.  *hotdups*   is worth recommending!"
1,"I could have all your clothes, handbags, and shoes! I'm  delighted! 🤩
Despite my best efforts, I can't seem to build a wardrobe like that, and I still have tons of mismatched clothes 🙄"
0,"Yes, more…."
10,A YES to more YT Do’s and Don’t
0,I prefer white and beige together they're both cool tones cream tends to be yellow and it doesn't look good on me beige has a more pink undertone to it ❤
4,I can never walk with my white trousers dragging the ground like that
1,"Thank you, colour combo options would be good"
1,Yes please 🙂👍
8,Lovely ideas ! I am quite older than you are but your suggestions still works on me! Thank uou ❤
4,"Please do more of these videos Lydia. I really enjoyed it. Who cares if something is sponsored. In my eyes, we are here to get styling inspiration from you. And we can get that even if a video is sponsored. If someone is (I'm sorry) but that shallow and that childish and won't watch one of your videos because it was sponsored. Then that will be their loss. I really love your new naked collaboration. So many great pieces . Congratulations again!❤"
0,"Love your style, Lydia. You are a cutie patootie. 😄"
14,The white shirt is beautiful but seriously. $335!!! For one top?! Very out of touch.
0,Hi Lydia…you were my inspiration for diving into my first Capsule Wardrobe last month!  I would like to request more plus size pieces from your clothing line cuz I’m loving your collection. ☺️☺️
2,Don’t forget your Canadian viewers… sentimental
0,"Lydia, im so sorry to ask, have you removed that cool shorts with your summer must haves that was here in spring?"
2,You’re awesome! ☺️
0,😢😵‍💫
1,"I really like your YouTube videos, and often found great ideas for styling for myself, and often revisit your videos. ❤"
2,Thank you love your videos! Can you please make a video on how you decide what items are worth archiving and what to toss? E.g. should we still keep our fave skinny jeans and waterfall knit cardis in case there's a comeback?
2,"Love it Lydia, thanks a lot"
13,"While I love your style overall, and most of your suggestions…
This white pair of trousers simply swallowed you. 😱
The width is just extreme for almost anyone’s height, 
and seems pretty unpractical for traveling, or for any occasion at all."
14,"I don’t understand what the big fuss is about sponsored videos. Especially when it comes to fashion. I’ve heard other YouTubers say they’ve received complaints in comments. I love your content, sponsored or not!"
2,"Yes, please, more videos like this. It was videos like these that made me fall in love with your channel! Also, thank you for addressing the sponsorship issues. It actually makes sense now that you explained it. The NAKD collection is amazing. Hopefully rhey are able to ship to Canada at some point. Very beautiful and affordable which is so great in this enonomy. You did your big one with this drop! 🎉🎊🔥"
0,Hi Lydia! Is NA-KD getting more stock of your pieces that have sold out?
4,I so wish Arket and NA-KD shipped to Canada they have such lovely pieces and I love your collab!
1,"I always enjoy your videos. They are a treat for me, and they have helped me develop a great style. Thank you! 😃"
2,"Funny you should lead off with cream and white! I actually stood in front of my dressing mirror this morning, trying to decide whether to wear white jeans with a cream cami. I thought you would approve, so I did, and immediately received a compliment on the outfit! Thanks for another great video Lydia!
PS, I just realized you call your little top a ""vest"" and we in the US call it a cami. Either way it's a light top with spaghetti straps. 😊"
1,"Excellent video as always, Lydia! Thank you! 😊🩵"
0,"Thank you for another wonderful video! Please do another shoe pairing video for summer specific outfits! 

I’m coming out of “hiding” after building my career and having three kids (too hard to buy nice clothes when your weight is constantly changing!!) and now focusing on me and had no idea where to start on my sense of style and your videos help so much. Thanks again."
1,Thanks again for this! Yes! More please:)
61,Your channel has made me realize over the years that simple classic clothing is what suits me best.
3,Please do more styling videos like this. Luv them
2,Yes! Love these videos!
35,"Please, dear Lydia, give us more of such super useful videos! 🙏🙏🙏 I'm particularly keen on the modern/effortless vs. dated/twee comparisons 👌"
12,"Yes, more of this kind of videos. Loved it!"
3,Great tips!! Thank you!
6,"General tips, please Lydia and can we get your Mum to join you sometimes, showing things that she would wear alongside you ❤"
3,How do you keep your white wide trousers clean running erands if it touches the floor. I wear mine with sneakers but the seam is always a bit dirty and dusty when Im back from shopping.
6,"Thank you so much Lydia! Yes, please, more of how to style evening pieces in daytime dressing xx"
64,"Yes Lydia, please more of these of videos. In the U.S., for the word twee, we might say something is cutesy. It’s great to see the visual of what not to do and hear the explanation of why something is feeling off with the outfit. Then so helpful to see the comparison of what to do."
3,"I would love to see you do more ""outfit ideas"" videos - they are so helpful for everyday life. Especially how to mix and match the clothing we have already acquired (from your recommended clothiers and whatever we already own). Thanks so much. Finding your YouTube, Insta, and the LTK site has been amazing for me! And I'm old...😉"
3,American here: twee = contrived.
2,Luv u so much
1,Would love a video on how to wear/ incorporate color into summer wardrobe
23,"Thank you…more colour combinations please . I’ve followed you for years and can understand concerns regarding sponsorships but as you said remaining true to your sense of style which we all admire greatly is the way forward. Personally after years recovering from a life threatening illness - I lost my original shape,style and confidence. I want to thank you for helping me understand what I needed to do to feel comfortable in my clothes again, instead of hiding you’ve helped me get out into the world again with more confidence ❤"
0,I love your last outfit. How can I wear all black in very warm climate?
2,I always say you learn something new every day. Twee style is one of those times. I recently viewed a short from you in regards on how to properly style tank tops. It was so helpful to realize that the higher neck ones were not the best choice under blazers. You look good in all of these styles that are presented.
4,Please do more
6,I love silk and I wear it in the summertime with white jeans. I also wear it with linen. I just love the fabric. It feels really good on.😊
3,Haha..thanks for explaining “twe” I would not have known what it mean without your explanation.
6,Please do more‼️
21,I’ve been investing in linen pieces (mostly shirts) this summer. Its so low maintenance (wrinkles looks sexy in it) and it instantly makes me look put together & expensive.
2,1st
0,Hey Lydia. The burgundy pant set with the ruffle bandeau is not available on the website. Will it be restocked soon?
0,"I just received my order of the asymmetrical top in red and taupe along with the trousers in red and white.  This is my first order with NA-KD and WOW so stunning and the fit is perfection! Great job on this, love!!"
0,"Hello, I can't seem to find the Asymmetric Volume Top and the Wide Leg Suit Pants in red in the link you gave. Can you help me by telling me where i can find them?"
0,Would you make more light weight long sleeve tops please😊
0,I want to be able to purchase!
0,I can’t figure out the sizes for USA… I need inches
0,Have recived some Collection today and all looks AMAZING!!!
0,Amazing collection! ❤❤❤🎉
0,Hello. Is a 38 a 12 uk?
0,This na-kd is the worst quality. Better to get one defence piece from ethical brand than 5 from na-kd.
0,I love all your items but im 5'3. Can you make a petite range?
0,"Congrats on this new collection, Lydia!
However, maybe next one should be dedicated to everyday/working outfits for normal people 🙏"
0,Einer so süßen Frau steht alles. Herzliche Gratulation zu dieser fantastischen Kollektion.
2,"Lovely Lydia, I am absolutely thrilled to see you doing so well! Your latest collection is stunning and although at my age I don’t go out anywhere near as much as I used to I did rush to buy the gorgeous pleated full skirt as I think it will look as fabulous in autumn with lace up boots and a fancy knitted top as it will in spring and summer. Having said that, I have asked to be notified when your yellow shift dress comes online, so ya never know. 😂
Seriously, I’ve watched you go from strength to strength over the past few years and it makes me so happy to see you succeeding in the fashion industry, which is not easy. It’s clear to me that fashion is where your passion is and boy, do you know how to make simple, classic lines stand out with your thoughtful, classy style.  Keep going love, push forward, onwards and upwards. I feel fabulous in the pieces of yours that I have bought in the past and I’m sure that I won’t be disappointed this year.  ( The white backless dress is also on my mind.)
Take care and thanks for making me a very happy retiree. ❤"
2,I like that garnet red.
0,❤
0,"How will the wide leg red trousers work for the tall girls? I’m 5’10” and in the US, so don’t want to order if they’ll be too short. Thank you!!! STUNNING collection as always!"
0,"I adore that first red outfit! Even with the ruffles it looks minimal and sleek. And congratulations on your collaboration!🎉 To me, everything feels kind of 1950s which was such a classic design era. 😊"
0,Love the collection but it doesn't look like they ship to Canada
0,Sooooo beautiful collection. I love your dog!! ❤
2,"Congrats, Lydia - loved almost every piece! And also liked your inspiration & joy transmitted through this video!🫶🏻🤍"
0,Why do some items on the website say „coming soon“ 🥹 I want to order the white skirt. When will it be available?
1,I bought some items from last summer collection and still very happy with it. Skipped the winter collection as the fabrics were mostly synthetic which I hate. Glad to find out that this collection has some more cotton or linen. To be honest I liked the previous one more as this one is a bit too much for me but ordered to check some items anyway. The silver buttons look very cheap to me ( sorry) but if I like the top I’ll see if I can replace them. Would like you to show some more styling options for those beige ones.
1,🔥
0,"It's all great, but those last two dresses are particularly amazing!"
4,"Omg Lydia, congratulations! You just keep getting better and better with every collection that you do. I guess that would be your goal. But this collection, oh my! This collection is just so, so good. I am 70 years old and there is not one piece I wouldn't love to own or to wear. It is a timeless and an ageless collection. I am in trouble because I want them all. Everything is beautiful beyond words. This will sell out in no time. You should be very proud of this accomplishment. As they say in the US. You definitely hit it out of the ball bark. Ty for sharing these gorgeous pieces of pure perfection indeed."
0,"🎯Congratulations on another stunning collection!💕 Please show us the new pieces styled with items you already have in your wardrobe. E.g. 1x new + 5-6 existing, to make different outfits."
9,"Of course Lydia is stunning and many of the pieces are well-suited for special events and occasions. However, not so practical for everyday life. I do love the sandals and bags that were displayed. Also, beautiful location for a photo shoot."
2,"They all are beautiful, but how can you wear such a long dress in a daily life, unless you're as tall as Lydia..All so dramatic. And I really like that red(first set) top but it looks like a carrying a baby 🍼 for some reasons."
0,Very floppy clothes not for me the worst ever
1,Beautiful clothes! Darling dog❤ 🐶
2,"Absolutely stunning outfits, especially the boat neck dress. I'd wear them whenever, life's too short. 😍"
1,Must have the black/mushroom dress; hope early access opens soon
2,"Very beautiful and classy just what you see in a fashion magazine! However, these outfits are not practical and usually for people who do not watch YouTube for styling tips"
31,"I loved when I found you, as you had such great taste, wore clothes not far from what I already had and I learned so much. As videos come along I realize you don’t dress for the average woman anymore, but more like a princess going to a gala every day. I don’t know anyone who needs that many dressy clothes. Please come back down to earth, you were so fun to watch to see what you’d wear for every day."
1,Beautiful collection! Congrats!! What time does the VIP access begins? What is your biggest size?
2,"Such a Fabulous Collection Lydia , Congratulations 🎊 ❤❤❤❤"
0,Vc ta mais linda
2,OMG I want everything!! Lovely collection!! I bought the winter one and I can’t be more pleased with the design and quality!! Well done Lydia.
2,Such a beautiful collection! Congratulations!
3,"Lydia, congratulations on this beautiful collection ❤️🤍🩶"
4,"Brava, Lydia!!! I adore these romantic silhouettes and the neutral palette. The detailing of the pleats and puffed shoulders are divinely feminine. I also appreciate how seamlessly these pieces can be incorporated into my wardrobe—whether dressed up or down. That’s especially a priority when traveling. 👏👏👏"
19,"Very pretty for a special occasion but most don’t seem really practical for a daily basis ( as most of the outfits from influencers really - they are just pretty around the house not for daily life imo) or for more curvy figures, as too oversized or too puffy. But still gorgeous. Well done"
2,Beautiful collection Lydia!
12,"Beautiful collection, Lydia! With your Grace Kelly looks, plus talent for design and styling; you will be at 1 million subscribers soon. I love how cohesive, and curated your wardrobe,  and collections are."
0,When can I buy these pieces? Right now would be cool🌝
3,Love them all!!❤
2,"Hello Lydia, 
I’m in love with this collection. Great job ❤"
7,Just love love  everything about all the pieces!!
0,Can you please tell me about your outfit on the video? The wine colour set? Where could I buy it?
0,❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
3,"Beautiful collection, I hope the quality of the pieces will be better than previous ones. I bought a lot of items from previous summer collection but some of them after wash (delicate wash) reshaped or shrunk. One of the vest wrinckled so badly than I couldnt get it to original shape. I followed all the washing instructions so I am absolutely gutted :("
7,Absolutely gorgeous collection! You’ve styled all the pieces beautifully. Congratulations!!
2,They are all very pretty!  I would love to see these items in a petite size since they are so long.
3,The custom fees to ship to the US are outrageous. That has stopped me from purchasing several times.
1,Love your collection lydia :) can’t wait to incorporate it into my wardrobe.
3,"So tasteful Lydia, beautiful colours too, you do make them look amazing, having the figure you have, but still love them all, fav white skirt and top ❤"
1,Omg I am obsessed with the entire collection I can't wait for the drop 👏🏼👏🏼🤍
0,I don't thing threre will be a petite option? I'm 5'1
3,These are all lovely pieces. Congratulations on such a stunning collection of dressier styles. I noticed a brown suede structured handbag on a chair in the hotel room where you featured the sandals. Where is that bag available to purchase? You look just marvelous in the whole collection.
7,"Beautiful collection, you’re incredibly talented!"
13,"Where can we wear those items? They are beautiful absolutely, but are not working for everyday life for mayority of people, unfortunately. Maybe for wedding, or some glamourous event which happens once in a few years."
7,"Such a beautiful collection! My favourite is the white bold balloon sleeve top paired with the white wide leg trousers. Each piece in this collection shows elegance, simplicity, and a timeless style. I got really excited about the sandals I’ll definitely be buying both colours along with a few other pieces. Styling comes so naturally to you 
you were born to do this."
1,"Each piece is really stunning and I absolutely love how you show how to style each one in different ways. I can see the love you put into your collection 😊 I appreciate how you’ve given everyone a day to see this video before launching everything ❤

My question for you is, can you wear any of these pieces while pregnant? I’m currently 6 months and I’m really wanting to purchase some pieces for cute maternity wear."
10,All the colors suit you beautifully! ❤❤
4,"Beautiful collection. Being 5’ 4” I’m guessing I’ll need to have pieces hemmed. I’m not a fan of the 1800 skirts, pants and dresses being dragged on the ground, which seems to be the rage in 2025."
8,"Absolutely breathtakingly stunning! However practically none of these gems aligns with my lifestyle 😢 The only exception might be the sandals and the white blouse :( And no matter how much we speak about dressing the rest down, those are occasion wears and can hardly be restyled to give them a new life, even flip flpos can hardly do this.."
5,Lovely collection! I love those asymmetric shorts & trousers. ❤️❤️💕💕🥰🥰
1,I need those red trousers!! I hope they made them in a size 46?
1,You are the best ❤
1,"Lovely collection Lydia! I think the oxblood colour would look great for the Autumn.

Also, your dog has grown hasn’t he 😁"
4,Stunning!! Stunning!! Stunning!!!
0,"I love everything 🎉 but especially all these wine red pieces, will definitely try to get the trousers with matching top in that colour and a dress. 🎉❤ I think they might be useful for a wedding (as a guest). Great collection !!!"
0,A lovely collection. Thanks for the advice re sizing.
0,"Great collection, again!! Could you give more detail on sizes for shoes, tops, bottoms. Thank you, can’t wait to try it on ❤"
0,"Lovely collection, Lydia. All the pieces are nice. When is the collection out?"
16,"Hi Lydia,
This collection is so you.
Everything looks so stylish, yet comfortable.
Can see these clothes being worn because they are so versatile."
1,Gorgeous! How do we get early access please? Xx
2,The white blouse I superb!!❤
3,"Congratulations Lydia, another beautiful collection!!! You knock it out of the park every single time. I’m signed up for early access to snag those sandals 😍 Laughing so much at that handsome little sausage wanting to play 😂 Mine does the same, especially when I’m trying on new clothes!!"
3,I absolutely loved the sandals!!
5,"Congratulations Lydia! WoW collection and waiting for tomorrow to receive my favourites. Please, record the styling videos using the   trousers from the collection."
1,Love love love the dresses with the back cutouts!💕🇨🇦
18,"Love the collection, Lydia! So much to choose from! Styling is amazing, so is your little dog😊"
2,Beautiful collection! ❤❤
3,"Вы единственная от кого я не отпишусь ,потому что очень хорошо подбираете луки.хоть я ничего не понимаю😆"
0,"I have absolutely no problem with sponsored videos, I really do not see any negative issue.
Lydia just keep on doing what you are doing.
I’m in Oz in a country town and we don’t have many of the brands that you showcase but I still gain plenty of ideas and shop for similar looks so all good."
0,Great vlog. How do you roll the sleeves on the Arket shirt dress?
1,"Hi Lydia, love your channel and all your outfits have really broadened my outfits range! I wish I could wear the trench coats and all the beautiful layering pieces etc. I'm from Australia and ordered the white denim dress. It's so flattering! I didn't expect to love it this much. Our summers here are brutal so I might not be able to get away with the long sleeves.. nevertheless it's such an easy and casual dress to wear! It's perfect for Queensland's winter daytime 😅"
1,I miss your What I Wore in a Week videos
0,"New subscriber here. Love your aesthetics and helpful tips. Thank you! You look great in everything, and it helps that you are lean, tall, blond and young. Just a suggestion it would be helpful to list your measurements so we have a realistic expectation and if you can feature some models with more diverse body shapes as it would attract more subscribers to your channel."
0,Mode hat immer noch eine ganz eigene Qualität
0,Could you please tell me what size you are wearing in the blue linen shirt? Thanks
0,"Lydia, thank you ❤  I am 63 and follow your style 😮 but would it be possible for your Mum to do her wardrobe pieces for the same occasions as you do.  Perhaps some of your lovely pieces are too young for me 🫤"
0,Hamptons? But Arket doesn't ship to USA. Isn't it ironic? Very disappointed.
0,"Gorgeous chic styling!
Can I ask what size striped jumper you got please?"
0,I generally love everything you wear but whenever you do bermudas i feel theyre too old for you 🤔
0,Very frustrating to see all the Arket items- since they don't ship to the US.  Please feature brands that ship to all. Thanks.
1,"I’m in a state of confusion every time I see Lydia in Bermuda shorts. She is slim, with some height, and they do her no favors. But, it’s Lydia! I know she has a better eye than me, hence the confusion. I just think a white skirt that hits where Bermudas do is SO much more flattering."
0,"Vc ta mais linda, seus olhos sao unicos"
15,American here. You’ve nailed that East Coast vibe - it’s giving Ralph Lauren or old school J. Crew. ❤
0,Arket doesn't ship to the US so this video was a bummer for us over here
1,Are the resin earrings lightweight on the ears?  Thanks!
14,"I always love these looks, especially from Arket.  Can the fashion influencer girlies please campaign for Arket to ship to the US, PLEASE?!?!?!  They will listen to you!"
1,Beautiful. What size do you wear in the lilac shirt dress . Most arket is too oversized for me. You would look good in a bin bag 😂
0,I love the outfits you put together you look amazing in them. Sadly Arket isn’t available in the US 😢
1,White denim dress is a new want for me🤍
7,"Lydia, thank you! Your sponsored videos are also useful and beautiful"
0,"San Diego, too 😎🌞🪄"
3,"Great video, love how you put together the pieces from Arket!"
0,They don't ship to USA the website says!!
0,Is Arket shipping to USA now?  They do!  Love these looks!
0,Is Arket planning on having availability in the US??
8,"Great video very informative. Some terrific choices, thanks😊"
2,"Great looks for either side of  the pond, Lydia! I've noticed lately in publications and media in English speaking countries, there are more and more crossover phrases and words. Vacation vs holiday, the line vs the que, and others! Even some Americans dropping prepositions! LOL !! 😂"
1,Love this video ❤
0,"On your latest short videos you have black trousers. I want to know what kind. I am trying to get the link, but I can’t. What brand are those black trousers. ❤Thanks"
1,LOVE LOVE ARKET. wonderful video❤❤❤
56,"As a long time sub, i just wish you'd do more videos that is not linked to a sponsor. Yes, you have to eat and make your money but why must every new video you drop feel like it is ALWAYS sponsored? What about summer pieces that you are simply loving just because? I feel like you are lowkey turning away some of your audience but maybe you dont care. Became a fan many years ago when you seemed more authentic. Now it feels very scripted and robotic. Just voicing my concern. All the best"
3,"Loved every piece on this video, everything looked good on you🤌🔥🔥😍"
2,Love the clothes but the discount code is not giving me 15percent discount.
0,Thank you for showing me this clothing line. I’ve never went on their site . I definitely will be buying some things from them. Looks like they have good quality cotton.😊
2,Love you videos and content but…….American holiday with pieces from a brand that doesn’t ship to the USA 🇺🇸 🤔
0,Your interpretation is so much more stylish than the east coaster dated vibe. 🇺🇸👍🏻
2,Nice looks but the hat and slippers look odd
2,"We Brits DON’T call holidays ,vacations. . 😡 please stop it with the Americanisms."
1,"💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Love love love this video!!!!
Such great peices and awesome styling. 🙌🏼
Still in hopes of Arket being able to ship to the US. 🙏🏼"
8,Love the East coast/Hamptons vibe of this video. You really nailed it. All the looks were spot on! Thanks so much.❤🎉
0,"You are ready for the Hamptons. I visited Bar Harbor, Maine and would highly recommend visiting. The looks you have presented are all amazing. My favorite is the polo top and the Bermuda linen shorts. I have six pairs of Bermuda linen shorts and find them so easy to style in the summer months. I love the watch you are wearing when you paired the polo top and shorts. What brand is that watch? Thanks for another fabulous video, Lydia."
13,"I think this is my favorite video you've done. It's so my style!!! I live in southern California near the beach, so these outfits are almost year round for me. LOL! Love the layering with the sweater not only for cool nights, but for over cast May gray or June gloom days. Would love to see a part 2 with more outfits. Keep em coming Lydia!  You are my personal stylist."
0,Love all your stlying Lydia. This is one of my faves. Love everything...hit the brief❤❤❤
1,"Beautiful pieces, however no belts.."
3,"Loved your laugh or smile when you model the hat. Do that more, because the clothes speak for themselves, which are great."
0,Staycation❤❤❤
13,"Love all of the pieces except for the shirt dress. The shirt dress always look like pajamas to me.  Too bad Arket does not ship to the US. Checked their website for shipping locations. Strangely, they had a location tab for US shipping, yet they wrote, ""We currently do not ship to this country. Please follow us on social media for latest updates."" But the fact that they had a location tab for US gives me a shimmer of hope. 😊"
2,Lovely styles! My favorite part is how comfortable and practical they all look. I find that typical summer styles can be so impractical and uncomfortable. Like super tight short shorts and skirts are so terrible and we’ve been gaslit that they are comfortable even tho you can’t even sit in them. I need leather flip flops like those! Been keeping an eye for them when I go thrifting!
2,"Hi Lydia! I would like to see you wearing more colors, at least for the summer!"
6,Top Top Top!!! Amazing Styling 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
6,"Every look in the video was stylish and genuinely beautiful. But that shirt-dress at minute 9? I wouldn't dare that one. Let’s just say, on anyone else it might scream ‘escaped from the psych ward’—yet somehow, she pulls it off like it’s couture~"
3,"I live on the east coast of the US and visit the New England states as much as possible.  And you are right, each outfit would be perfect and I would but so many that you showed.  Does Arket now ship to the the US?"
1,"Hi Lydia, is the code only available to UK customers? I tried to use it on the Ireland website but it doesn’t seem to work for me 😔 Lovely pieces and they look stunning on you 💞"
4,Nice as allways
4,Stunning 😍

0,"Hi there. 
Can I check for your opinion about some necklaces that are on my wishlist. I would like you to rank them based on design and wearability. 
1. VCA Guilloche 10 motifs necklace. 
2. Tiffany graduated HW link necklace. 
3. Cartier JUC Torque necklace with diamonds."
1,I live for Lydia in summer 😅 i dont watch when winter starts but the summer videos? Im glued!!
0,"Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes"
0,How do you wear slingbacks? They always fall
0,Linen shorts looks so large on you
1,"i hauled quite few pieces of goelia in singapore since i saw your video before. agree with you, most of their fabric are top notch. and i’m also quite fussy about fabric. but i’m a bit confuse about sizing. it runs smaller for me. i can use xxs for top whilst usually i use xs and s from zara / mango. 
i really like the tencel skirt and top you show here. but a bit worry to buy online since sizing a bit difficult. will check them out when i go to singapore again. they don’t have it in my country, unfortunately"
0,Love all! all the items are so easy-to-wear!
2,The way something steams really does say a lot about a piece of clothing. I have clothing that looks beautiful but gives me a headache every time it needs steaming.
0,"Love your style, but I have the same question as @ellajohnson8640 — how do you avoid getting the hems of your pants filthy/having them fray? Any time my trousers touch the ground, they inevitably get dirty and fray. 

Also, would love a segment on strapless bras, because you seem to have cracked that code, as well!

Thanks for all the amazing content!"
1,Such a beautiful classy looks ❤
1,The white trousers would also look great with a red top and with the tan handbag. Love the V neck dress!
4,"Every piece is gorgeous!
Lovely summer styling 🥰"
22,"How do you deal with pants dragging on the ground? I love the look, is there a trick that everyone knows and I am just clueless?"
0,"Hi Lydia, can you do some styling tips for brides?"
1,"Really supper summer outfits, very wearable. Thank you."
0,What brand is the black woven leather bag please?
0,"Beautiful outfit,  I love the black skirt with the green top, nice outfit!
I love Goelia brand, I have a few pieces from them."
3,"This is a great look for women under 50 and/or women who still like their arms . Unfortunately, after two surgeries on my shoulders, I have scars that I don’t want to show so I prefer  some kind of cover on my upper arms - they’ve lost muscle and the scars show more when I have a tan . Ditto those shorts which I don’t find flattering on anyone ? 
I can see that the fabrics are lovely and they look great with neutral and bright accessories . 
Also , having worked in London , I’d definitely avoid light colours because you really do feel grimy by the end of a working day so I wouldn’t wear them for sightseeing in the city - you certainly couldn’t rewear them after a punishing day in the city ."
2,These are all so gorgeous it is so nice to see some smarter summer outfits. My favourite are the first outfit Halter top + Linen shorts and the Linen maxi dress
0,Love the black bag! Is it dragon diffusion?
1,"It seems like some of the sets contradict your basic rules. 
The black top and the white skirt are too wide and don’t look good together."
0,Hi where are your black sandals from please? (The ones u wear with the white skirt set) xx
0,"Really lovely wearable pieces. My favourites are the linen halter, white shirt, and the green tops. Really beautiful! What do you do with your big clutch bags at a restaurant?!"
0,Hi! In your LTK from about a week ago you listed the Poplin pull on barrel pants from Abercrombie. They look see through. Are they quite sheer as they appear? Thanks so much!
0,ținute grozave
1,All outfits that can be replicated! What shoes would you wear if you had to walk about 30k steps but still look chic?
0,"Dear Lydia- where is the small camel handbag from?( outfit #2)  I didn't see it on your LTK. If anyone else knows, please let us know! Thanks!❤"
1,Your red resin earrings would look marvelous with the second outfit (tan linen top & trousers).
4,May I ask what type of bra you recommend for halter tops
0,I couldnt find the off shoulder blouse link😐
0,Beautiful video-love all the outfits and I’m a stylist also. My issue is finding great quality items for some of my very slender clients who are a size 00 in US. Any recommendations or future video with brands you’d recommend are appreciated. Thank you Lydia! 👸🏻
0,Love your videos ❤
1,"Love the tencel-blend sets, probably gonna buy one. Thank you!🫶🏻"
1,"Lydia I have been following you since 2020 maybe but your old videos were good. But you explain 1 outfit too much, 1 minute maybe 1.30 is enough otherwise it is getting boring or if you want to explain 1 outfit for 2 min at least show with different accessories or other piece of clothing/shoes"
10,"I find it so wholesome that your mom works with you and that she steams the clothes! There is something so caring about wearing a piece a loved one put together for you, same as eating something someone cooked with love for you. You are so lucky! Of course, I love your content as usual."
1,The dress is absolutely  stunning
0,I want to buy everything!!
0,And links for the bags?
0,"All looks good on you.
what watch are you wearing Ms. Lydia?"
0,"I love them all but,those linen shorts are just fabulous💕"
0,About oil-resistance trousers/ fabric; is it suitable for summer heat ?! Compared to cotton or linen for that  matter ??
1,Love the black outfit!
2,Lovely! My fav was the first outfit - a wow. Perhaps a more summery handbag though? I found the black bag a bit heavy for that look.
0,What bag brand is the smaller black braided one with the Kiwi green top and black skirt?? ❤
0,❤
1,LOve the first set :)
2,I love her style and recommendation. Also love her personality 😊
0,Will you do a whole video about sunglasses? 😎
3,All these pieces are really pretty and complimentary
2,Great Easy Effortless & Chic for Summer … LUV !!
0,"Just ordered the white pants, because I only have white jeans and wanted something more structured."
1,I love linen! 😊thanks 👍👍
0,Hi Lydia.  Beautifully styled summer neutrals.  Where did you get the brownish/taupe flip flops with the gold detail (that you wore with the long linen dress)?  Would love to find a pair.
0,"У меня это было давно. Достану, буду носить 👍🏾"

3,"So nice and realistic, there are people advocating wearing high heels with their summer clothes, fantasy world."
0,Great outfit ideas! Thanks!
1,"I really have enjoyed the items that I’ve gotten from Goelia. I feel like a lot of the times the fabric does seem like great quality. I absolutely love this style of sponsorship, where I could press the link and see all of your favorite stuff with the codes at the top. Very convenient Honestly I’ve never seen that before."
1,"Hello, Lydia. You have such beautiful shoulders, so that allows you to pull off any type of summery top. My favorite outfits are the first short set and the Tencel white and/or black outfit. I am 68 and I just love wearing Bermuda length shorts. I have six pairs of linen Bermuda shorts and I pair them with either matching blazers or vests. I haven't tried Goelia pieces. My concern is if they would fit petite women. This was a great video."
0,Gorgeous! Are the pieces true to size? It looks like you’ve sized up from your normal size. I’m similar size to you so not sure if I should also size up. ❤
0,Horrible looking outfits

0,Anyone have another recommendation for the Arket dress. Can’t buy it in the US.
0,"The gray dress is strange, badly made, messy"
0,"Why EVERYTHING has to be black, white or solid even on holidays???"
0,Stunningly beautiful...love the neutrals 👌
0,LOVE your videos!  And your hair looks so cute curled:))
0,Love it!! Timeless and elegant
0,"Do you have to pay for the extra beach bag if you have your suitcase 10kg? 

And what are you doing with linnen after you put it out your suitcase😮did you take a little steamer or iron with you, is not in your suitcase? Not every hotel has a iron😢😅I don't like wrinkles and if i roll it it also doesn't work well. Do you have some tip?😂"
0,Great inspo and obviously very well thought out. xo
0,I’m now considering buying a Gucci bag at   *hotdups*  😎🤗 Looks like you’ve seen it all now and have a great perspective!
0,"Interestingly, the stitching on the inside of the handle is finer in the  *amzrepe*  than in the original (the leather is not as worn)."
0,❤super
0,Amazing!
0,Bravo! Great inspo for holiday travel made simple but complete. Loved all the outfit ideas. Perfection ❤🎉
0,I love this😍 Going to Italy in August but so overwhelmed with how to shop and pack for this trip. First time out of the US. Italy dresses and skirts?
0,"You are without a doubt, my favourite stylist! Great inspo 😊"
0,"You are very elegant! Absolutely loved this collection, and I feel I can make it work for my 50’s age group. Thank you! ❤"

0,Is everyone going for a beach vacation ONLY?? I mean I genuinely want to know why all vacation clothing includes beach appropriate outfits only.
0,Excellent some great ideas thank you😊
0,Where did you get the black pearl necklace? Cute outfits.
0,Great video! Useful and inspiring
0,I would love an airport video!
1,"All outfits are super similar, all white similar cuts, there is no variety except for the final dress and the printed pareo"
0,How about you and your Mom together with similar looks?  Would love it.
0,Whats your color season?
0,"You keep linking the Zara bubble skirt, but you aren't wearing it. Please link the dropped waist neutral maxi skirt from all your travel capsule posts."
0,I’m so glad I found you! Love your style and content. Thank you!!

0,Loved this Lydia!! Definitely one of your best videos yet! 😍😎☀️
3,I watch your summer holiday videos because I live in the tropics and enjoy the inspiration.
0,Would love to see airport outfits please
0,Super helpful thank you for the tips! I’m such a spiller I couldn’t do that much white 🤣
0,Hello! The AF shorts are sold out. Do you know if they will be restocking them? Thank you!!
1,"I remember now it was 10 months ago. Do’s and Dont’s of holiday packing. No tight, tops , one small bag and no heels"
0,"Amazing, I am following this capsule to make mine. Thanks Lydia."
0,Thanks for existing.Always wanna look classy without spending much especially when my country is too colourful..you are my internet Fashion guru
0,"Would love to see an airport outfit video!! And some wedding ones too as a bride for the bridal shower, engagement party, etc! :)"
0,"This was a really nice capsule. I think for me, the only things missing are a sports bra and leggings,  trainers, and 1 pr of jeans"
0,I love the full white skirt and balloon hem tank. Thank you for sharing your wonderful tips Lydia. What product do you use to keep your hair looking so sleek and shiny?
0,Yes airport dressing video please!
0,Genius!
0,I always have to buy clothes when travelling … I get bored with so few clothes 😅
1,"I'm interested in the airport outfit video here on YouTube please, I am not on Instagram, can't cope with that many social media accounts. Thank you ❤"
2,"Yes please! I need a pair of sandals beige/brown that is comfy to walk around my trip to Italy this Summer.  As well, please add more casual capsule for this kind of walk, sight seeing, food tasting holiday vacation. Nothing fancy outfit or in heels for me as we are not planning a formal dinner date with our friends. Thank you so much Lydia! An avid follower of yours here! (Vancouver, Canada)"
0,Wonderful video! Would love to see an airport outfit video.
9,"I always use a carry on size suitcase/bag, even for 2-3 week vacations (as long as it’s not a winter vacay). No chance of the airline losing it, no waiting at baggage and no
Lugging huge suitcases along the streets and hotels. Well done, Lydia!"
1,Great video. Yes to the airport video on YT. X
0,I think airport idea would be brilliant as I always seem to get it wrong.
0,"Long time watcher here! This isn’t appropriate for my lifestyle at the moment (overweight with a toddler lol so no short stuff, wearing bandeau tops or white around here) but the concept is amazing. I’ve literally just come back from a week away but will be looking at this again for my next holiday! Also the packing list at the end is 👌🏻"
0,Great job ❤
0,I love all your videos. Such helpful advice. Great work XXX
0,Where is the white maxi skirt from please?
4,"The Zara dress is very comforting, looks easy to wear if you felt a bit off one day during a holiday. I particularly liked the tailored linen shorts."
0,"Sisters! Finally found a reliable fashion bag review website!  *amzrepe*  The bags are of great quality, the price is less than a fraction of the original, and the payment process is safe, so you can go for it with peace of mind!"
0,I would love some recommendations for nice comfy outfits for airport in summer
3,I find summer airport outfits to be challenging vs winter no problem.
0,Me gusta el plan! 😊
1,Your hair looks great.  One of my favourite videos!
1,Hi Lydia. What size are you wearing in the maxi white shirt dress? Thank you. Love this video.
1,Yes airport dressing ideas please
1,Great video 😊
0,you packing the suitcase in that gorgeous dress is the ultimate chic vibe 😂🤩😍
4,"Excellent! Love how this collection is breezy, chic and easy to wear - in the words of my favorite stylist, it’s effortless! 😊💕"
1,"Loved the looks, so stylish and easy to wear x"
0,"""My mom even asked me about the  *skydup*  website! She praised me three times when she carried it to the tea party, thinking I bought her a new BV😅"""
0,Loved this video! Yes on airport. Also could you do this type of video for business casual work trips too??
1,"When I’ve worn anything by the pool it isn’t being worn anywhere nice unless it’s been washed. Especially white. Everything gets sun cream all over it. If you are wearing enough SPF it is getting on the clothes. 
Do you wash your clothes all week whilst away? 
White linen shirt dress would look like a crumpled mess after a single wear. I sometimes would wear something like that out then relegate it to beach cover up. But I definitely need night time pieces and beach outfits as the beach outfits get pretty grungy very quickly."
2,Functional but I found it a bit boring for holiday ❤
0,"In these beige low heels, your feet look so chic, so miniature, so light. I can't understand what produces such effect..."
1,Wa are so excited too by this video. Thanks a lot.
1,"Lydia! You are becoming less cool 😢 you are young and fresh, and what you are wearing lately doesn’t show that any more!"
2,"Simple but Chic, smart, and elegant.  Thank you."
1,I’m always confused at tips that show how you match 1 piece all over again with others. Does that mean you’ll wash them and hang dry for the next use in the same trip?
1,"Beach towel, pyjamas"
0,"Ok, I pulled some things today for our cruise in a few weeks. It's a Disney cruise, so I'm definitely putting more color into it - Navy, coral, cream/linen. After watching this, I'm thinking of a few ways I can edit further, and see what goes together. Thanks!"
0,Thank you this was so helpful 🖤🏝️
1,So good like always ! Thank you Lidia. I hope you have 1 million subscribers soon ! 🙂
1,Great one! Yes to airport outfits please 😊❤
0,Can you please share if the white Arket shirt dress is transparent at all. I have a pet peeve when dresses become so transparent with the sun shining through revealing legs our undies. Thank you.
2,Thank you Lydia! Such a good video! I love it! We can learn so much from it! Please give us some more tips🥰💐
0,Would love to see your airport outfits please Lydia! ❤ you’re stunning luv!
0,Thank YOU!!! This came out at a perfect time as I’m going on a cruise  in a few weeks. This helped me to look at the clothes that I already have and style them in many ways.
0,You are so good!  Going to Paris this summer from USA… help.  I’m using your recommendations as a guide.  I usually only pack black… easier.  We usually travel in the fall.  I try to pack as little as possible so I am able to shop.  Any suggestions from you or anyone would be helpful.
0,Lovely! Is the white skirt you are wearing available? Ty!
2,really usefull ideas but I think that white clothing on holiday are very unpractical
0,Yes to airport outfit video🎉
0,Genius
0,Perfect content!! ❤
0,So great! Yes please an airport dressing video on youtube🎉
0,Brllant
0,"Lovely!  I feel like I went on a fantasy vacation just watching the video.  
Could you give some quick white clothes cleaning tips?  I have a white linen jacket that can’t be washed and dry cleaning will turn it yellow.  Also, those unsightly stains that end up on white pants that I can’t seem to get out…"
0,I need a video like this on how to pack for a long weekend (4 days) with a small ‘under the seat’ bag
0,Excellent love it all
9,"I am a long-time fan of your content and this was indeed such a great video. Insanely useful and inspiring. If you could do this video concept for every season, every year I’d be so grateful and very excited 😊Thank you! ❤"
0,"Thank you so much, this is super useful!! ❤️ I would love more specific tips on how to wear white shorts safely as one travels actively throughout the day, since it could be kind of see-through depending on the lighting and such 😅"
0,When does mum come back? 😊
2,Loved this.  So many wearable options and looks so put together.  Would love to see the airport outfit ideas also please.  Thank you for your great videos.
5,"Ik love the idea of this video. Although I really love white clothes, for me there was too much white in this capsule. If you wear a white top and skirt it gives the same feel as a white dress. For me it just looks to much alike."
5,Great travel capsule wardrobe that can go from day to night. I love how just changing the shoes & accessories creates a new look. And a definite yes to airport outfits.  😊❤️
2,"Yes a full video on airport outfits would be perfect! I also don’t travel to beach destinations, so could you include flying between different climates, and other times of the year?"
1,This video was really great!! Well done! 👏🏻 Happy for a full length airport outfits video!
1,"Jesus loves you, Lydia! 
Don't ever forget that."
0,Love all your holiday outfits. Very well put together XX
1,Where can you find the exact strappy white sandals? Love the video!❤❤
1,I love every single outfit in this video. The only thing is that I walk sooooo much in holidays that I definitely need to wear sneakers 👟 😅
1,the versatility of that small raffia bag is astounding!
2,Yes to airport outfits!
1,"Loved the video! This is my favorite type of content (as opposed to the Lily Silk/ Goelia videos, sorry!) 
So inspiring and informative ❤"
0,all very very spot on! i also have been aiming that zara dress! may want to order it’s still available.
0,great vid! ◡̈
0,Great video ❤
0,"A tip: don’t bring too much jewellery, you can buy silver or handmade jewellery in most resorts, beach towns, even made with shells or wooden beads"
0,Just in TIMe! Going on vacay in 2 weeks ❤❤
0,"Thank you for the tips. I really love your classic style and think your suggestions align nicely with my style and wardrobe. As a new subscriber, do you have a winter holiday capsule video?"
15,This capsule travel wardrobe is absolutely spot on. You look marvelous in each and every piece. You make it look so easy.
5,This is indeed one of your best videos and all of the looks are so elegant and glamorous!❤
0,"Amazing video as always, love this new concept !"
0,❤❤❤❤❤❤
0,Do you have any ideas for those of us that don’t have pierced ears?
0,Best video I have seen!
3,"Airport outfits, yes please ❤️"
1,Awesome ideas and thanks so much ❤
0,"This is perfect timing because my college kid is going to Rome in June, and we wanted to make sure she wears stylish clothes but not overpack. What we are worried about is what shoes to wear for a lot of walking. She wants sandals but not ones that can’t protect the feet with 20k steps per day."
0,"Hi Lydia , trying to pack my holiday case for the last week  😣! This has reaffirmed so much for me ! Find it very difficult to pack as I love classic/tailored pieces . So now I am sure what to pack seeing this ! Great outfits and you can still wear all pieces again at home and not waste money buying one off holiday pieces in colours you won’t wear again !! Love it 🥰. Super tips and outfits ❤"
0,Vc ta mais linda
0,Nice ideas.
15,The only thing missing is colour
0,❤❤❤
0,"Hi Lydia, You have sorted my case out. I'm packed and still have some room left. Now I'm waiting for the airport outfit video and I'm good to go.
Make it before the 12th of June, please, as I got my flight booked for that day.
Brilliant and such a helpful video.
Yes, one of your best and useful posts ever !!! 
❤🎉"
5,"OMG, this is exactly what I need! I was actually going to message to see whether you had a video like this. Going on holiday next month I need to fit everything into hand luggage. Can’t wait to watch this XX."
2,"These outfits are a bit boring for trips to tropical islands or exotic destinations
Also, if you are going to some European countries, forget about open top bags, to easy to steal your goods...."
0,"Excellent video, Lydia!  And right on time for summer vacay prep.  Please do a long-form video about airport/travel outfits and tie it into this as a part 2/continuation.  Also, please do seasonal versions of this as a series for Fall, Winter, and Spring.  Thank you for all that you do! ❤️🙏🏾"
0,"Just missing the hat and some sunscreen, love it!"
0,One of your best videos! I will be saving it for future travel packing. Thanks!
0,"Surprised about this as just recently I watched a video about holiday and it said no heels, small bag no tight tops. Am I missing something?"
1,Love this video. I’d love to see an airport dressing video please. Thank you for all that you do 💐
1,So well thought out Lydia.❤
24,"T I would love to see more vacation wardrobe capsule videos like this, including airport outfits, different types of travel, and seasonal outfits. It would be great to see matching outfits for couples as well!"
0,Loved this video definitely want the airport outfit 😍  could do with a 10kg city break one too xxx
1,777th like! I’m manifesting my vacation with a stunning new wardrobe 🧘🏽‍♀️✨🫶🏽
0,"Вы такая игривая в этом видео 😊 Заметно, что Вам самой очень нравятся эти наряды ❤😊"
0,Excellent job! Simple and elegant. I would need to add jammies and running shoes/workout wear. Fancy shoes would need to be lightweight.
4,Such a great capsule. Really like the split screen visual. Please consider consolidating the commentary so the segments are shorter. 22 minutes is a wee bit longer than needed.
74,"Yes, I would like to see an airport dressing video. Great work!"
2,Of course you want airport outfits thank you very much
4,Absolutely stunning. How do you wear so much white when you’re putting on sunscreen though? x
0,I am lucky owner of the na-kd set and I use it heavily since last summer. It goes with almost every colour possible! I am going away next week and that was the first thing I packed. I absolutely love the summer collection from last year :)
0,Beautiful collection Lydia. I especially loved the cream floral resin earrings and the tailored shorts from Abercrombie. Ty so much.
0,Thank you! I really enjoyed your video. I especially loved the skirt and tunic from your Naked Lusher collection. Could you please let me know where I can purchase such a skirt and tunic? Thank you.
6,"Those big chunky earrings are so good with all the outfits! I have both black and white ones, very large like yours, made of acrylic. They really go with my white shirts and also black camis, to emphasize bare shoulders. When packing I believe accessories are the most important thing! And even if we are not traveling these simple outfits fit with summer so well, when we are more casual and being outdoors."
2,I was literally about to pack and made the research in your channel to see if you had a video about it! Tks for the perfect timing haha ❤
8,You are correct.  This is you at your best.
0,super excited <3
1,Perfectly executed summer holiday capsule wardrobe video! Thanks for sharing your genius styling methods!
13,"You are right, It is one of your best ever videos! 👏"
1,This is perfect. Thank you for your thoughtful suggestions. ❤❤
1,The Zara dress is stunning on you unfortunately at my age can't do the strapless anymore
3,what a really useful video! thankyou one of your best 100%
72,You ARE my ultimate Classic clothing Influencer!!😍
0,"Great make your holiday pieces work video. Love, love, love your hair like that too!"
2,Love the Na-kd fashion white skirt set. Is that still available anywhere?
1,Love the option! Most of the links aren’t working for me
2,Love love loveeee this ❤❤
1,FABULOUS  👌
2,I’m obsessed with that strapless green dress! ❤ and the long shirt dress! Been hoping to find one of those at the thrift store ❤.
1,So Good.  Well done. Very helpful.  ❤
1,"Unfortunately, we don't get ""holiday"" here in the  States. However, your pieces are stunning!❤"
1,Gorgeous always. Love that Zara dress on you.
2,Love them all - great ideas and love the vibe 💗
0,Thanks Lydia! That Zara midi dress looks gray on your camera. Is it taupe/warmer or is it cooler gray? On the website it looks warmer. I prefer the warmer color
1,Great video 🥰🤍
11,Would love to see some airport outfits!
0,Looking classy
1,"Don’t  most European airlines have an eight kg limit? 
Is the 10kg bag a check-in?"
1,"Haven't even watched all the video, but i need one of these videos for winter ❤❤ (really how can i spend 20 days travelling around europe in december? Heeelp)"
1,Awesome Lydia. You are truly gifted.💕
25,Thank you!  I always take too many clothes when I pack!  Great needed video! ❤  Hope you give us more helpful packing videos!
2,"My OCD won't let me put on an outfit that's not monochrome. Help, girls? 😭♥"
16,Really great tips! So practical! Really helpful to see some of these pieces worn because the photos of the models (on the Arket site for example) make them look so stark. Seeing how they look and flow on you makes them seem so much more wearable! Great idea for a video! Thank you!
1,Great ideas.   I love them all.
0,Top notch
0,This was exactly what I needed for my summer trip—thank you❤ You look gorgeous!
0,Top Top Top as always!!!!! Great video. Great idea. Yes. That new video on YouTube
0,Yes!!!!😍
0,Thank you
0,There were some lovely polka dot pieces in the 80’s.
0,"😂 My daughter had jelly shoes when she was 3. They were cute and practical around water. No, definitely not for me. You didn’t mention crocs. I really don’t like them but I’m sure they’re good gardening shoes."
0,"Logos annoy the heck out of me. I refuse to spend a fortune on clothes, simply to end up being a walking placard, advertising for free. In addition, they are usually very poorly made when they get to mass production. 
I love small, unobtrusive polka dots and it’s hard to beat a crisp, white shirt or top. Classic white tops really elevate any outfit.
You didn’t cover my pet hate - those ugly, crotch-at-the-knee, very baggy, ankle snatched pants that squeeze their way into the shops each year. In my youth we called them MC Hammer pants. I loathe them. I have never seen anyone look good in a pair of those pants. They are, imo, only useful as dusters."
0,"As a retired professional stylist I agree with everything on your list. Quick question, when did bandeau tops/sets become bando? I hadn't heard this before so you have educated me. A little tip from me that you can obviously ignore, with such a fussy top as the one you are wearing it would look so much better to wear smaller/simpler earrings, no offence just forty years of experience x"
0,Молодец!!!
0,"I agree with everything except for crochet tops. They look very flattering. I wear them since childhood they are girlish,fresh and you g. I m 66"
0,"I totally agree. This is a fun video. Choosing the best  *amzrepe*  bags from every brand we want, without a budget. What a fun thing to do. By the way, I love your selections and look forward to your new vlogs."
1,I've seen better takes but this was ok
0,agree 1000 percent.
3,Blink twice if you're ok. You could never convince me that crochet & florals are not the perfect vibe for Spring & Summer. Boho chic can be very classy.
0,OMG I'm on board with all your No-no's.  Crochet in any way is better left for grandma's tabletops.  BTW in love with your top.  So easy-elegant and chic.
0,I agree about jelly shoes and the designer logo trend are horrid. That’s about it.
0,"In my country, North America, women in 40, 50’s show more skin when wearing tops than European women, eg. Tank tops, spaghetti straps, low cut necklines. I feel this looks for lack of better word “trashy”. I sense this word is too harsh because no human being is trash, but I just don’t k is how to explain it. I try to tell my aunti and momma to maybe try something more conservatively fashioned because it looks more elegant and like you’re not trying to hang onto youth becuz in my country it’s like we idolize youth and flinch at aging.  I guess I might sound stuffy like a grandma but I feel like what I see is obvious to the eye. I’m 15 years old and my mom will wear my tops. I like to share but it honestly looks like she is wearing a kid costume becuz it just looks conflicting not smooth and elegant"
0,I absolutely love your style and agree with you on all of these trends!
1,"Agree wholeheartedly about the logos.  It's paying to be a walking billboard.
I love romantic floral dresses in the summer,  it's a special type of vibe."
0,"Lydia, I love the blouse you are wearing in this video!"
0,I love rugby shirts
0,"Great vlog Lydia! ❤
Here’s a tip for stripes….try to make sure the stripes line up at the seams, otherwise it will look off putting and inexpensive. Parachute and Jelly shoes aren’t for me. I’m not Mc Hammer or 8 anymore either. 😂 Florals can be gorgeous when done right…aka Zimmerman and Farm Rio are two beautiful examples of what to shoot for as far as looks/dupes."
0,I was already filling you but missed your new video post???? Bell ON 😚
1,"Hate what you are wearing, that shining, asymmetrical look is so 1980s and looks like you tried to get dressed in the  dark and the dark won😅😅"
0,"I mean florals for summer are ugly to you but you loove those dark colored baloon and parachut styles, how am I supposed to take advice from you 😅"
0,"From a hot climate:

Rugby top is winter ,  cold wear a practical top underneath.

Lacy tops, pants and shorts. Please send to the bin with grannies doilies.

Plastic and pvc shoes and clothing are hot snd sticky. Even shapewear should be kept to formal wear and worn under suffererance.

Agree, my floral maxis are gathering after single use.

Can’t stand logos. Reminds me of my elderly father looking at a logo T And asking If they would be paying him to wear the logo. Laugh😂"
1,Polka dots ❤❤❤!
0,Damn just donated a parachute Eileen Fisher dress….to be fair though it had white paint on the inside….
32,"Honestly, I'd never wear the top you're wearing, the super shiny chunky jewelry you're wearing, or that nail color / shape. But you look great in all of it. Moral of the story - we're all different; wear whatever you want because it's not that deep."
0,"I'm with you on crochet tops. In my opinion they are an eye sore. They look old fashioned and just plain ugly. Not for me. As for logos, they are classless."
0,Boho reminds me of hippies & poor personal hygiene 😂
0,How do you feel about a bandeau top over a long sleeve blouse?
0,"I love your style! Just wondering, given your beautiful diamond ring, are you getting married? If so, would you consider doing wedding/bridal dress episode?"
0,omg where is the top from??
0,"This is a great video! I love the parachute dresses. I have 2 pairs of jellies and can’t ever make them look good 😩
Just FYI most the links I clicked on to shop didn’t work"
0,"Boho is  fabulous and romantic . Asymetric tops like the ones you are was wearing are not flattering  or comfortable, in my opinion."
3,"I love my rugby shirts, my crochet tops and boho style. Also, I am saving up to buy a perfect pair of rubber shoes. I would not wear that top you are wearing, seems a little like a courtain 😺 and the colour is too bland, looks like you are sinking in the wall.. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Also, everyone should wear what they like and that’s the beauty of fashion!"
0,정통 이탈리안의 맛을 집에서
0,"I think the bothersome thing about crochet as a staple piece is that a handicraft aesthetic has a difficult time translating to a sleek, elegant aesthetic. I love cotton crochet for blankets, but like you said, the weight and texture seem to be more of a decorative bohemian vibe."
0,"Thank you. How awesome it is when we finally have classic elegance back in style in 2025. 😎 So sick and tired of the “street walker wear” espoused and promoted by the hip hop communities and tattoos……🤮 😁 More Miss Lydia Tomlinson please!❤ I also agree on logos and furthermore, as a real estate investor myself, I just think the logo value proposition is terrible, I mean, it’s bad enough people are paying exorbitant prices but then having to advertise for the brand on top of it all…..😂"
0,"Lydia I’m an abstract painter and just can’t handle the artwork behind you 😅 Is disruptive in the image and not in a good way because it’s full of just saturated colors “from the tube”… 

I’m way more colorful in my artworks than in my outfits (lol I don’t do much colors on clothing😅) but it just distracts and disturbs me in a way I needed to let you know hahaha
I haven’t seen your vids lately so I don’t know if it that that your home or a hotel/office but just wanted to share! ❤️😘"
0,Jellies do come in handy when it’s raining in summer. Crocs makes acceptable stylish ones.
1,Flouncy floral or ruffle dresses are feminine and romantic . It compliments many types and shapes of bodies. Yet Some may not be comfortable with this style especially athletic bodies . But nevertheless the flouncy florals or polka dots or any pattern  I feel are not outdated? It was and will be beautiful forever 😊
0,very intresting!
1,"Surprising that the zara top shown is actually polyester.  I really liked it until i found that out. No wonder its cheap! Never wearing polyester- clingy, smelly, sweaty...nope."
4,"Note how lydia is not plastered in tattoos.  I despair of the trend in some people to accumulate as many as possible...even models in some mainstream fashion companies are covered in the nasty things.
Unpopular opinion, but nothing looks less classy imho.  So kudos to LT for not slavishly following this stupid fad. There's other ways to express individuality and unique characteristics."
0,I love how you consider the trends for your style. I need to embrace this more. ❤
1,"Oh my I love floral and romantic tops it looks good on my petite curvy figure. 😂 
I live in California and I love lush feminine styles and I’m so happy to see them in stores more vs just the boxy, minimal silhouettes. I’m so bored of the neutral color old money style myself although I do have some foundation pieces. I love color, perhaps because I’m an artist.  It’s always fun to see what others love or hate! Your style looks stunning on you and works for your classic vibes."
0,Omg jelly shoes 🤣🤣 hideous!
3,"Finally, someone is making sense with the floral boho look! I do think some people can pull it off, but there is no structure to it and it gets lost in the flouncy style."
0,I agree on the crochet tops! In the 70’s everyone was dyi-ing crochet tops! Most were ill fitting and looked like Grandma’s handiwork. Then in the ‘90’s back they came…even in crop tops. Still looked like something out of the attic! Oh well…to each her own!
1,"I agree with most of these. Especially the plastic sandals!!! As ugly as the UGGs but I totally disagree with some like floral dresses. Zimmerman makes gorgeous ones, crochet tops have a place like the beach. We should all wear what is flattering to our bodies and we love. My style is classic however boho can be super cool and some women can rock it."
0,i would pick floral dresses over parachute ones anytime all the time they're so ugly and unflattering and they would go out of trend quickly i fel like
0,Crochet is nice. I like boho style tho
0,That top makes you look like a sausage wrap
3,Just came from watching a video by another well known Youtuber and she is paring the Crochet tops so classy and minimal with a coastal look. . It all depends on your likes and don't likes.
1,"Re logos: If you want me to advertise for you, pay me to wear your whatever!"
3,You have wonderful taste! I’m in my 70s so I have worn all of these trends both the likes and dislikes over the past decades! And all I can say is the simpler the better. It’s hard to convince young people of this but when you see photos from the past there are Looks that make you say to yourself what was I thinking???! Crocheted vests looked granny in the 60s and it still does!  I wore it but when I look back it’s the simple Mary Quant shifts from the earlier 60s that we wore that you could still wear today.
0,"Logos are a huge no no for me personally. Screams ""look everybody what I can afford"" - SO tacky. With designer sun glasses the logo can hardly be avoided unfortunately but there are quality brands out there that don`t plaster their logo all over the temple."
0,It's ok to pay for quality in brands but I'm afraid logos are rarely stylish
1,Crochet tops? They are really nice and great in the warm months I don't agree with you on that one

1,"New subscriber here. I’m slowly going through your past videos. On crochet tops; I have three I wear in the summer over sleeveless dresses. They cover my upper arms, because they are short sleeved, while remaining breezy and cool. As with all the fashion videos I watch, I take what I can use and leave the rest. ❤"
1,"I love your classic, minimalist style. I am curious...Where do you wear these outfits? As a retired person living in a small city, I would be out of place with most people. Even Toronto, a major city close to me, seems to be on the decline as far as fashion. Hudson Bay is closing 96 stores. I love to dress up, but need the psychological willpower to do so. What would you recommend?"
0,Por favor algún día podrías hacer un video para bajitas como yo ❤🌺pues a veces lo largo no sé si nos quedan bien ❤❤te lo agradecería pues en este mundo también habemos bajitas creo la moda se olvida de nosotras 😢 mido 1.52 cm 😢
0,Nos encantaría que tus videos pudiesen tener traducción en español ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤saludos desde México
1,"I don’t know why I just don’t like it, looks stupid, looks so bad - sounds totally unprofessional and arrogant. You should go and study before speaking up to others and trying to influence people on youtube with your own by the way outdated personal style."
0,I'm 100/.agreed with you .
0,"I will definitely go for a bandeau set for my upcoming holiday thank you. Also think the cord/rope belt idea is a great addition. I have found wear a crochet top over a matching colour cami top has looked lovely in the past, so still onboard for that one. Usually wear a strapless bra underneath so not too many straps going on"
22,"The flouncy floral dresses and crochet tops would look great on someone with a natural essence in their blend. It helps to discover what suits you best personally, then you will never follow trends for trends sake."
2,"That Zara top you are wearing looks amazing! I would never tell it’s Zara.. looks so expensive, chic and classy! I ordered it in 2 colors :)"
0,"Thank you for offering a counter point opinion on trends. Obviously it’s sparked discussion and people are free to disagree, as you point out multiple times. But it’s so important that influencers not be pressured into only promoting what’s for sale, in my opinion. And I think you are very polite and considerate when you do offer your point of view so please keep doing so."
0,"I'm  totally opposite of you 
Not saying you're bad."

0,Totally agree!!
5,I agree with all of the trends to avoid except the crochet tops. I love them.
0,Thank you for being direct
0,I so agree
0,❤
0,"That can’t be your real voice or accent. Tell the truth- you’re imitating Richie Rich, right? Dahling!!"
0,"i agree except on the polka dots, they’ve always felt distinctly british to me and so i feel like i’m playing dress-up - if that makes sense ?"
1,Well Zimmerman has mostly everything in floral print and I love every piece if I had the money to buy those pieces I would buy many 😅
0,"Assymetric is an absolutely no for me, unnecessary and not practical, it will go out of trends in September, but You can cut the bottom"
1,"Hard agree on every point, in particular the designer logo overload. I find it so desperate and tacky. Also, the jelly shoe trend needs to end. I wore them in the 80s as a kid. That trend should’ve stayed in the 80s and 90s. 😅"
0,"My main concern with crochet is that they are all handmade with an individual hook, usually by exploited women and girls. Knit can be machine, but crochet is always hours and hours of hard work."
0,"Maybe you don’t like crochet tops as you perhaps don’t have the aesthetic to feel comfortable in them. They are actually a timeless staple that on the right aesthetic looks wow! It’s that nonchalant piece that I guess doesn’t suit everyone but when it does, it’s major style points. It’s effortlessly chic in my opinion, if you know good style."
0,"I do not do many trends, most of my clothes are years old, a few decades.  My mood is if I wore it before when it first came out I will pass on it going forward, looking at the torn jeans from the 90s.  Did the jelly shoes as a kid, the crochet tops as a teenager.  I am not a flouncy, floral girl.  At 6ft tall I enjoy looking striking and dressing with a classic bend.  I wore the parachute decades ago and still have a Laura Kim skirt that I wear whenever I like ironically with an asymmetrical ivory top.  A short polka dot look is a must for summer for me, all bought years ago.  I once wore a knotted dress on the runway at FIT graduating class and one of the knots failed over the chest flashing Bill Clinton, he commended my walk backstage so no harm done!  I love my Susan Monaco bandeau dress from the early 2000s that is comfortable and sexy all at once."
0,"When i hear bandeau I think of a cropped tube top style, I was surprised when I saw the strapless tops!"
0,Shirt you have on?
2,I like all your ideas with clothes and trends. You are my favorite!
2,I had a crochet cardigan and got my sleeve nearly ripped off as i caught it on a door handle!😂 straight in the bin!
1,No logos ever🤮
1,Florals are for the vacation and it’s the best
0,"Hi Lydia, would love to see your Mom and you again modeling."
2,I adore all of my Doen dresses which some are definitely flouncy florals but I get so much use out of them! They are usually silk or cotton and very easy to dress up or down. They always feel so special ✨🥰
1,This is just an opinion. Her style is different than others. I'm edgy and I do love a Boho kimono and Jean's at times. What do you love? Wear it!! End of story.
0,What not to care!
1,"Brilliant as always, thanks Lydia ❤"
0,I totally agree about rugby shirts: please leave them in the rugby pitch! The worst types are the thick striped ones that do absolutely nothing to flatter women's bodies!😂
1,"🙂Lydia, I have a few vintage crochet linen tops I like that remind me of when my style used to be more boho , now it is much more classic, but a good reminder that we don’t have to have one style. But I don’t take offense as you said just not for you. I agree that when a big name brand does something ridiculous like very pricey  plastic shoes everyone wants to follow suit and we should question those kinds of trends. I enjoyed this video."
0,I’m not feeling the top you are wearing…it gives me “I’m not quite finished dressing” vibe.  Otherwise I agree with your do’s and don’ts.
1,I think I would wear a crochet top when I have a burning desire to look like Granny’s coffee table…😊
0,"Hello, Lydia! Can you make a video about gym? I need to go to the gym and need to put on smth to get there. Usually it’s all sportswear because of the huge bag with a lot of important stuff. How would you style a big sport bag? And what kind of bags for gym do you like?"
0,Haaaaate logos! So tacky!
0,I just dont like it… 100x
0,"The asymmetrical cut of your top is not properly executed, taking away from what should be a chic, feminine look. We should all be careful"
0,Do you like chunky knit tops instead of crocheted tops?
0,I find florals to be so feminine.
0,I hate logos.
0,I'm very boho.
0,Those balloon pants are Horrible!!!!
0,The crochet tops are great with a camesol underneath and jeans with some fun accessories.
22,I adore the crochet tops!!!!
0,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0,I agree with all your dislikes on this video. Trends are a big mistake for me as I have been caught up over the years with stuff I just have to let go even having paid mega bucks for some outfits
1,"I know this may be a little off topic, but would you consider doing an episode where you teach how to pose? You make such beautiful poses in your clothes and I would love to learn different poses for pictures. It makes the outfit look even more classy."
0,Love my new knitted sezane top lol. But I hear you on needing an underlayer. Makes it more of a spring top than summer
0,Agree with all i find the current trends very impractical  all this ruffle stuff see through stuff its all a pass this year!
5,"Rugby shirts, in a pretty color, tucked in with jeans is a cute, put together look. So, it’s all in how you style it."
58,"One trend (that really started with fast fashion for the average person) I would love to go away forever is saying “How are you going to re-wear that or restyle it” as if having a well-made floral print dress that lasts for years is terrible because someone might realize you wear your clothes more than once! Prints, bright/saturated colors can still be classic and modern."
0,I like boho ❤😂
1,I love crochet only 🏖️
5,I love rugby shirt❤
1,"I’m with you 100%. Not surprising really, because my style is very similar to yours, minimal, classic, sleek."
7,"Love that and your honesty ""It's ugly""! re the rugby shirt."
5,As a woman in her late 60s I don’t think of boho as floral prints and crochet……it’s more a loose casual look.   In the 70s boho was wider legged pants and loose tops.   I never wear floral or ruffles…..it was never in my boho repertoire.  I still love this look….classic isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.
1,"Good morning Lydia.

I agree with what you are saying with regard to logos. I think in an outfit they are completely unsightly. What say you?

I love asymmetrical clothing. It adds something a little bit different and makes an outfit much more interesting.

I have four main rules to my outfits and closet. They are as follows:

1. No hoodies or jogging bottoms.
2. No gym or athleisure wear.
3. Where white trainers that are actually clean. Nothing worse than white trainers that's left to become dirty or grubby.
4. No graphic Tees or tops.

I personally have a two colour rule for any outfit. I tend to stick to basics. Like a basic t-shirt. Vest AKA tank tops. Basic plain button down shirt. Plain white trainers with minimal logos over them.

Lydia. What is your opinion of double denim and what is your opinion on my basic rules?

I love polka dots and Stripes. Also I like leopard and animal print. What is your view on the forementioned? Have you got any animal print in your closet? I love playing striped button down shirts add pinstripe suit sets. Could you please produce a video Lydia about how to style prints and patterns? Because you can go so wrong with styling the above.

Lydia. I love your content and you always look so classy along with looking sophisticated. Your partner is one Lucky young man. You are one very classy looking young lady that dresses so well.

Lydia. Thank you very much for all your great content here on your YouTube channel.

What is your opinion on either thrift flipping and altering your own clothing?

Do you own a sewing machine and would you alter or transform any outfit into something new?

I look forward to your reply regarding all my questions.

Regards pure."
3,Love what you're wearing in this video
5,"I wish I could like polka dots. I think they look great on other people, but I feel ridiculous in them!🤣 Asymmetry is so subtle, sexy and elegant!"
1,"Please put the cup away it does nothing for your delivery ,got so distracted wondering if you were going to drink from it or spill anything that may be in it"
0,Love your classic taste  Do you ever focus on ages 50+ .?? We often have more revenue and look for quality.
0,You always nail it! Thanks❤
1,"i love chrochet tops though i am also typically a practical dresser like you. I just bought some jelly shoes from old navy, on a whim they are adorable!"
0,"These links don’t work! COS, Ressi, & other stories!!"
1,Love crochet and flouncy !😂
2,"I’m not sure that these tops would technically be bandeau, as they are strapless, but they are not stretchy and tight all the way down. Perhaps modern designers are modifying the term."
0,Yes I’m with you. Hate all those avoid ones. Easy to leave them alone! Love the asymmetrical looks atm although I am a boho girl so may still dabble in a flouncy dress 😅
3,I’ve watched a lot of content on style essences and I would guess that two of your essences are classic and dramatic.  So it totally makes sense why you don’t like these styles;  for example anything boho or too “quirky”
3,Bandeau is a lovely look but I can’t wear it at my age being 71 years old.
3,Wouldn’t plastic (jelly) shoes make your feet sweat?  And then you’d be slipping around.  Ridiculous!  Totally agree.
0,"I agree with you 100% thank you for these videos. I am 69 and I always like to hear what other people’s opinions are ,good video."
5,Will add my comment about crochet tops.  I don’t like the ones that look like gramma made it in the 70’s BUT I am a gramma and my arms aren’t what they used to be.  I have a couple of crochet-type button front ‘jackets’.  They are very airy so I can still stay cool while covering up my arms.
2,Too bad that those asymmetrical and strapless tops are not working for women with not tiny breasts who actually need to wear bras on straps that give support :(
2,"Bandeau Tops always make me very self-conscious about my underarm fat... I love the look of a bandeau bikini too, but I could never wear it😅"
2,"I love the asymmetric look when I look at your pictures, but on myself it somehow makes me look... old?😅I don't know what it is, but I feel like an old, old lady, same with polka dots actually...🥲"
29,Crochet tops are good for hot places with a lot of sun.  They are really open so let the breeze through but give the illusion you are wearing more clothes than you are.
8,Love some crochet tops! I like your style most of the time but sometimes i find it too serious or matronly.
2,Such great assessment
0,"Thank you, Lydia! Stay classy; classic style is timeless. I still have pieces from the 90th; my daughter is fitting into them now, and sizes 00 and XXS have left me. 😅 The older I get, the more my clothes shrink.😊"
2,I agree about jelly shoes...wore them as a kid...over them!
5,I have to disagree on the rugby shirts haha as a mother I find them so convenient and nice! To switch between a regular shirt and a tshirt
3,"Hi Lydia, fabulous video and ad always helpful. I agree with you on the do and don'ts. Thank you for sharing 🎉❤"
0,"I would add to the never wear list those knitted halter neck / cutaway shoulder type tops.  I bought two of these in cotton /linen, I do like them but in summer they're too heavy, and in the winter they're not practical - a bit like the crochet ones."
0,Crochet tops look like doilies
19,"I believe it’s a thin line when discussing trends. Individuality is so important and obviously, we are very much led by the seasonal merchandise available in stores everywhere. Having the choice which we feel represents us and makes us feel happy and comfortable gives us the freedom to wear what we want. Fashion is so personal - it depends on so many factors - silhouette, characteristics, taste, finances and how one spends their daily life. I don’t really care what’s ‘in’ or ‘ on trend’- I just buy what I like and feel confident in whatever that may be."
1,"I do not wear the flouncy dresses, but they do look good on some ppl depending on their body type. But I always wear a soft floral dress in lighter months. With these dresses you can by pass the big chunky earrings which cause so much pain in the ear lobes considering I’m not even getting any younger! 😅

Comfort is such a priority for me. I have always gravitated to small to mid size jewelry.


Jelly shoes…unsure! But no judgement here…❤


But all in all I realize you have to find your personal style that suits you, you feel comfortable in and works well in your lifestyle than just blindly copying/ following others. I do love women with individual styles. ❤

Life is short… live it large! 😊"
2,Grandma called those “doilies “
7,"I think simple elements of boho can add something interesting to an otherwise plain outfit. For example, a solid white flowy skirt takes on a new life when worn with a solid white loose top that has ruffles on the sleeves and collar. You’re right that it’s all about not combining loud florals with ruffle overload."
2,"Darling, some of the links are not working.. I want to support your amazing style!❤"
1,Bring back the cold shoulder. Covers the top of my arms but show off my shoulders.  😍
0,Got crochet waistcoats last year love them. I wear mine with a tshirts or over my plain summer dresses.  No to JELLY SHOES 🤢 only suitable for maybe for the beach.
7,"I love crochet tops☺ but I totally agreed with the jelly sandals haha. What I‘ve liked the most about this is a fun conversation about fashion, seeing your preferences and embracing personal style✨"
0,💯 🎉❤
0,Birkenstock avoid or embrace ?
1,"Great content, as always ❤ love your work and presentation ❤"
0,Overall I love your minimalistic chic style. Some of the pieces here I won't wear at all. Your fashion sense is similar to mine and your advice usually is spot on. Thank you!
6,"I fully agree with crochet tops :D they look DIY,... made by granny..."
0,"Thanks Lydia and I completely get the message you're going for. BTW I wore rugby shirts in high school in the 90's. lol.  I've found some of your videos from 3 years ago. I'd be curious to know if you still agree on those styling tips, as they're quite classic, or how those tips might have evolved after only 3 years. I've been stuck on the idea of tight and fitted for so long, but bit by bit adding new things in, and also reviving older pieces that still work when tweaked and paired differently. So I've found these videos so helpful!"
1,"Rugby shirts are not my cup of tea either but well, each has a different preference. However, what almost always happens is that the white collar does not stay white in the wash when the shirt itself is colored. Not a good look."
0,"Love your blog and style, and I love floral dresses 😅 btw they look gorgeous on you, in some of your summer videos!"
6,"Fab - I definitely embrace boho a little more than you and I’m also enjoying neckerchiefs this season. 
What I love is your properly thoughtful and discerning approach. It’s inspiring 🎉"
1,"jelly shoes are so 2008 (at least that's when i remember wearing them as a kid), i don't know why it's coming back, it's so uncomfortable esp when your feet get sweaty. also lydia your arms are looking great!"
3,"Lydia, lydia, lydia, you are fabulous!"
122,"Your preferences are definitely heavily influenced by your body type, which is fine! As someone who is curvier and just a bigger size than you, I like the feminine, floral dresses and would look absolutely mental in any of those parachute styles 😂"
1,Crochet top is for festivals 😆
5,"While I do like crocheted tops, and wore them when younger, at 65, they are either inappropriate or aging. 🙁 back in the day when jelly shoes were in (way back) I wore them one time. Too sweaty. Flouncy dresses depend on the print, fabric, and quality of sewing. I make most of my clothes so I am super fussy. 😬"
0,"I loved my jelly shoes too…….when I was like six years old🤣Rugby shirts were a hit in the nineties for men and that was okay, but for women not so much🤔🫶🏻"
0,Love your style Lydia! Can I ask where you sourced the art on your wall? I’ve been finding it hard to find large scale artwork for our home. Thank youu!
0,"Agree with you on the rugby shirts, crochet tops, flouncy florals, and jelly shoes. So far this spring, I have bought an armload of knit camisole tops in navy, white, black, and bright yellow. A crisp white cotton shirt, nautical wide leg pants with diagonal buttons, a light cardigan in French blue, and a navy/coral medium floral print cami top with a little peplum. This piece is rather more understated than it sounds, and looks super good with jeans. As I shop, I keep in mind all of Lydia's style advice! I think of it more as a guide than rigid rules."
1,"I love your videos.  Those to avoid is what you wear for this show.  It looks so uncomfortable, unnatural and not elegant.  It looks like you try so hard to look different...."
0,Nobody’s feet smelled worse than a little kid running around in jelly shoes.
0,Yes crochet is ogle
4,Rugby shirts aren’t a trend. They’re a classic. Love my flouncy floral dress. It may be a one season wonder but I didn’t pay that much for it. Asymmetrical tops don’t look elegant to me. Or tops with one sleeve. Adore my polka dot slip skirt from J.CREW.
2,"This was an excellent video, I agree with your picks of noooo and love your picks for yes.

I love polka dots and thrifted a skirt last year.

But this year, I added pin stripe pants to wear with a cotton top and loafers, but I would love to see style inspiration for pinstripes?"
2,Love your advice and kindness ❤ love everything you put together
3,The problemw ith crochet and lace is the feel on the skin. No one talks about the rough texture. If the lace is lined it can be ok but these can be pretty scratchy
0,"Rugby tops with a white collar is even more boring, unflattering, is on point"
3,When I was young I had a crochet dress. It was a long sleeveless sheath. It was heavy and uncomfortable since I had to wear a slip under it. Wore it once and gave it away. 😂😂Never again crochet anything. 😅😅
1,Can you please link the Zara top you are wearing. I love it so much but your link just takes me to the Zara home page.
1,💯
14,"I always hated crochet tops, I couldn’t agree more with all your points."
7,Perhaps be a little less judgemental Lydia. By all means tell us what you won't be buying but with less of the superior attitude.
4,"May be the reason why you do not like all these clothing, that you are a more ""classic type"" on a kibbe range?... In a ideal 
world i😊luenzer will include other bodytypes too."
2,"Omg! I thought you have something going on with your shoulder cuz, I saw something black on the side of your neck and I thought you have a shoulder sling under the blouse and that was why one sleeve is longer than the other. I kept looking at the blouse and Is just the style and the black 😂 is the microphone! You look beautiful as always. Thank you for your beautiful tips on style always on point."
1,"I never knew rugby shirts had become a thing, again😬"
8,"Oh no, watching this while I’m wearing my crochet top!"
0,What strapless bra do you guys recommend?
11,I love ballet shoes. They remind me of my childhood when I took ballet training. Wonderful time of my life.
0,I couldn’t agree more. ❤
0,I’d agree. I don’t like any of those things. Jellies do make my feet sore and Rugby’s remind me of school uniform.
3,"One thing with (summer) trends is that the corporations cater to the younger generation (or adults who think dressing that way says something about them). Colours are one on one-hand, but telling me what to wear year on year across seasons is just ridiculous"
9,I can never leave floral dresses alone
5,"I think that fashion designers are out of ideas so they make these nonsensical fashion pieces and luckily for them, consumers eat it up. I never liked loud clothing and i'd be embarrased to wear anything with loud logos,wich is why i stear clear from brands that are synonymous with this."
19,"I love crochet tops, they fit the boho, beachy aspect of my personal style. I agree there are some cheap, ugly crochet tops. But there are also some really beautiful ones, and I especially like pieces that incorporate some crochet, but aren’t entirely made of crochet. I think it appeals to my love of textures— I also like eyelet lace and embroidery."
0,I just took husbands rugby shirt - I love it but I wouldn’t buy one
31,"Florals for spring, groundbreaking. 😅 Love me a great floral. Oscar de la Renta allllll day.  So happy this trend came around this year. It's nice to mix it up from solids and stripes."
5,"well, I watched this video just after I came home wearing my crochet sweater lol personally I like crochet items because I can't wear lace or broderie anglaise, but I agree they do not necessarily fit every single occasion or setting. but again everyone has their own preferred styles and aesthetics"
1,I just bought a dress from boden  for a wedding. Looks great and I love it so totally disagree with you on that point.
2,OMG this was so useful Lydia! Thank you for this! ❤
63,I LOOOOOVE the crochet tops 😂 I usually wear either black or neutral bodysuit underneath and I love pairing them with something structured and polished. It so unpredictable and also looks intentional
2,"I steer clear of anything made of plastic as it can’t be good for your health, so the jelly shoes are out for me.  I’m always mindful of what can be absorbed through the skin, so I look for natural fabrics/materials in clothes, shoes and accessories."
1,Agree with this content! How about a review of ME&EM?? I find their styles quite classic. I know the price point is a bit high but they have sales as well. 😊
9,I hate asymetry 😊
26,As you said about jelly shoes liking them at 4 is exactly how I feel about mary janes. They are cute on 5 year olds but really not good on grown women lol!
5,"Crochet tops are ugly-I agree! Jelly shoes too! Your expression is so funny detailing what you don’t like about those pieces. 🤣👍🏻 No parachute or balloon styles for me! I love a subtle floral dress, it’s so Charleston! 💞I love polka dots!!!!! So classic, I think of Jackie Kennedy, Princess Diana and Audrey Hepburn! Appreciate your take on the trends! 😁"
4,"I like your shirt in this video, and you look so feminin and fresh. Your hair, your jewelry and your beautiful manicured hands make it just perfect! 😊❤"
2,Amazing
0,"Im pondering the really oversized cream below the knee safari shorts look
Is this bad???"
7,"Your asymmetrical top looks super great on you..Not everything will suit me, however, I always find a useful tip or two from your videos..Thanks for your effort!"
20,Loving your honesty in this vlog Lydia! No point sugar coating 🙌
41,Agree with everything except.... I LOVE a crochet top!😀
7,I agree with you 100%
7,Rugby shirts are for the pitch. 😆. 100% agree.
2,I don't watch anything with the word trend in it. That top your are wearing is pretty ugly. It doesn't know what it wants to be.
2,I so appreciate your style‼️
2,I love pick a dots
9,See I don’t like the parachute style
3,If they are y not wearing a designer piece they don’t feel important
5,People think they are better if they wear logos Thsy think it’s a status symbol
41,"Absolutely hate asymmetrical!  I just got through watching another fashion influencer who said things that are so outdated and mentioned asymmetrical lol!  So, bottom line is wear what the hell you want!"
4,"Lydia, for all that has been said here a big, big like! I do avoid those things, and they have been a rule for me without any doubts."
18,"Always love to see your take on the trends for the season! Agree on most of your dislikes (don’t love crochet either, but can see a clear jelly shoe being styled super chic and minimal)  and love most of the things you are loving except for the asymmetrical. But the beauty of trends is we all get to pick and choose what we’ll do or not do and personalize it to our style ❤"
9,"Lydia you look so elegant and gorgeous in your outfit and jewellery (statement earrings and bangle) in this video and just how I imagine Grace Kelly would dress. I really enjoyed your interpretation of wearable vs non-viable trends. Best wishes, Tina"
1,I also don’t like most crochet things however I do own 2 vintage 80’s beige/cream cotton/linen crocheted made in Italy sweaters/tops that I wear every summer. I think what makes them timeless is the fact they aren’t floral patterned.
27,"Agree on most of the summer trends except for the flouncy, floral dress trend. Personally, it doesn't suit me, but always wished it would. 100% strongly dislike the crochet trend! Hate is a strong word, but it's getting there."
4,"Love polka dots ❤️ 
Great video!"
3,LOVE the earrings!! Where to buy please.
5,This is so helpful - what I need to do in my own wardrobe - figure out what I have and what works with today’s trends. It feels intentional and thoughtful.
19,I really enjoy hearing you say that you hate something or find it ugly. 😂
166,"I agree with most everything except crochet tops. Some people really suit the boho trend and it’s a definite esthetic which has stood the test of time for the most part. I think that the more tightly knitted or lined versions can be very pretty and summery. I don’t think everyone is into your totally minimalist, architectural style (although I am) and I prize individuality in fashion. I think you kind of come off a wee bit condescending when you discuss styles which are not in alignment with your views. However, totally agree with you on jelly shoes and rugby shirts Ugh! Not for me."
0,Cord Pendant Necklace does not work!  Item not listed on USA Cos website.
103,"I love the flouncy floral dresses and several of us are having fun wearing and re-wearing these at my all-female office. They're also wearable for dates, friend dates, PTA meetings, etc etc."
31,"I almost always agree with Lydia 🎉 but having a quality print from the likes of Misa Los Angles, Boden, Trovata California, ME & EM. They have some absolutely gorgeous prints in blouses and dresses with modern cuts - just to give a nod to the trend. The dress I bought from Misa Los Angles is so packable and such a flattering cut. Love their dresses!"
11,"Rugby shirts, that's a no brainer.  No no no"
3,Bravo Bravo 😊
5,This is so random but Lydia please consider auditioning for Britney Spears in her biopic! You remind me so much of her 2001-2004 😂 and I mean this as the biggest compliment ❤
0,"I really love learning from you. However, i am a long torso, short legged 5’4 Asain, and somehow, what looks great on you doesn’t translate to my body. Lol! Still love the inspiration you give."

0,Do you like to match polish on finger and toe nails
0,"Hi Lydia, congrats on your 30th! 🎉🎊. It’s all lovely styles and outfits you’re presenting, but what happened to those lovely floral outfits you used to present a couple of summers ago? Are they currently out of trend? Personally I can’t wear brown and black and beige all summer long. I’ve also noticed there’s a lot of yellow this season. Would like to have your comments and views on the subject of colours for this season. Could you recommend something? Thank you so much for your wonderful channel ❤"

1,"Hi Lydia! At your urging last year I bought two pairs of pointed toe, low heel, sling backs, one in a champagne beige and one in black. This summer, I'm focusing on accessories, especially larger earrings and casual but nicer broad brim hats. In the southern US the sun is brutal in summer. So even though you haven't talked about sun hats specifically, I can still apply your concepts, such as my latest broad brim raffia hat with a black hat band and bow. It looks old Hollywood with my sunglasses! I know you would approve!"
4,"Hi Lydia, 
Where are you going on your next vacation?
I would love to see a video on how you choose your outfits from your wardrobe and how you pack your pieces in your suitcase to minimize wrinkles. As well as being organized. 
You inspire me to dress my body with more classic, elegant pieces. I find it hard to make all the individual pieces come together to look as beautiful and effortless as you, your content helps with that! 
Thank You! 
Ashley"

0,"Personally, I only appreciate the appearance, not all bags are worth the money. That being said, I do buy quality fakes at  *skydup*  because I wouldn't spend the money on the real thing."

1,Cheers to turning 30! Without a doubt the best is yet to come! I really appreciate this video. I’ve seen those black kitten heel sandals in a couple of your videos. They must not sell them any more. The link takes me to &  Other Stories but not the shoes. Searching I don’t find them. I need them. Ps I’m 59. I love your style.
1,Where is the beautiful brown dress you are wearing?
2,"Happy Birthday Lydia! 🎉I’ve been subscribed for a couple of years now, love your channel! Really hope you get to a million soon ❤️"
0,Can I just suggest that it would be really useful if you could link your suggestions in the video description as well as on LTK. I don't find LTK very easy to use tbh.
0,"Happy birthday, Lydia!"

COS - are all of the items sold out?"
0,Which brown dress are you wearing in this video? Thanks!
0,But this zara suede blazer stinks like a real piggy!!! I get one and just return because of that -it’s real poor quality like from wrong part of leather. I think new suede jacket need cost twice more that that one in zara.
27,I’m 65 and still find most items relevant for me and get some terrific ideas for my daughter.
1,"Happy Birthday! 🥂
Thank you, Lydia. Great video and especially thank you for being so thorough with the accessories."

0,"Thanks for a new video!!! I was rewatching your recent videos and I was watching other bloggers during this time, but couldnt find among other bloggers anybody better. You are the best. So if you disappear in the future for some family issues, we will be waiting for you!"
0,Happiest 30th birthday!🎉
0,I’ve been enjoying your channel. A little disappointed you would promote fast fashion. The effect shops like H&M and Zara have on the world is overwhelmingly harmful in a multifaceted way.
0,The link for the silver necklace with the black strap isn’t working. It says the page is not available.
1,What is the nail polish color you use ?

0,"Hope you had an amazing🤩birthday!
LOVE your videos!😍 Hope you can help me decide on the sizes of a few pairs of Flattered shoes I’m currently looking at. I’m a half size like you and not sure I should size up or down with these shoes. Would you please provide some insights in the sizes of the Belinda Suede Black, the Bon Bon and the Bodil that you also owned. I had tried on the size US 6 last year but feel very slightly snug. I didn’t have a chance to wear it in as it’s a defect pair and returned it. Just wondering if the Bodil loosen quite a bit after a few wears? Thank you for your help!🙏🏼"
