0,"Tim, you've gotta style legitimizing ""old money."" the pages and people pushing the ""look"" are pretty blatant about it being about coming off as ""classy"" and presenting an image rather than a genuine interest in style."

0,"Hey Tim, love ur bracelet (the one with the gemstones) where is it from? Nice video btw :)"
0,Ah yes it’s good to intentionally wear jewellery. If you’ve unintentionally worn jewellery that’s a big mistake.
2,"hey Tim, I've been following you for a while now good content really insightful. please try to post more often."
0,Good vid!!!
0,"Fit ✅
Baggy ❌"
2,"I really like your videos. Would be cool if you brought in some folks with differing body types. I’m a bigger, muscular guy - used to play (American) football - so some of these styles don’t work with my frame 😅"
0,jeff nippard? lol 5:30 ?
0,Man you are a great help 🤍
0,Great video Tim - some nice tips
0,Would you have talked about skincare in this video if there wasn't a skincare sponsor? Honest question and I don't mean any offense.
0,"The best fashion piece you can have is your own body. Hit the gym. Every clothes you wear will look good if you're fit, much more if you really know your style. You'll be unstoppable if you are fit, and you own your fit."
0,shipping tim and daniel simmons after the soft launch glaze in this vid xD
24,Another key thing is keeping fit and healthy - goes with grooming. Having a decent body is key to ‘feeling the part’ and serves as a good foundation for all the nicer clothing you throw on
1,Dude love the sweats but $209 gd
0,Love it 😀
2,This dude talking about elevating style when he’s been on the same oversized tshirt phase forever
3,Discount code isn't working
2,"Fashion is always changing. I used to get mocked for wearing skinny jeans back in 2005 when nobody was wearing them except punks or skaters. Few years later everybody started wearing them. Then when I started wearing baggier jeans, the cycle continued, got mocked gain just for all them to eventually adopt the style. People are sheep. Only reason why a lot of people are into fashion now is cause of social media. They used to be clueless."
0,❤️❤️❤️
0,What Jeff Nippard is doing in your video?
0,"What glasses do you use? I wonder if you have any good tips on eyewear. I've always found your clear and minimal glasses to be quite elegant, and that's not mentioning how well it fits your style"
1,Tim i like your style because it's clean and chic. Bravo 🎈🔥✨️

4,I'd argue both of the outfits in the thumbnail were uninteresting and in the example of a decent outfit vs a great one ( 0:15 ) the great one looked worse imo
0,where do u get ur short sleeve shirts
0,"Man, just goes to show how your style has changed... A few years ago you were using ankle pants, haha. Admittedly I am still stuck in that era... I love me some ankle pants."
2,"I love your videos, and you definitely have waaay more exp than me in fashion. I like all the other tips, but idk if I fully agree with the first one. A nice pant break is great, but there's also shorter length pants/capris/shorts that for sure should've had a place in here."
0,"shipping rate is crazy with Geologie, but nice pant break tip bro"
0,🐴👍👍👍
0,Everytime follow this person advice for your next shopping ....
83,Ugh pant break is my arch nemesis! I just can't get it right! Here's the thing - I like it a bit longer in the summer (feeling a bit slouchier); and slightly shorter in the winter with how it meets boots and ankle.

0,Tim you gotta hook us up with those loafers - they impossible to find at Zara now. Maybe an alternative?
0,I miss you bro!
0,"Yo creo que es algo que nos pasa a todos, vamos a la feria más cercana de nuestro barrio y empezamos a comprar y comprar ropas sólo porque están de oferta sin pensar si verdaderamente esa ropa nos va a servir o no , y así nuestros roperos se van llenando de trapos que después no nos sirven para nada, la cuestión es comprar inteligentemente como bien lo muestra este muchacho en éste video 👌, ser previsor,austero, y metódico calculador en lo que uno se necesita comprar para vestir realmente y no comprar por comprar y nadamás, porque no solamente es una perdida de plata sino de tiempo también y también de estilo claramente, ésto lamentablemente también lo aprendí ahora a mis casi 44 años habiendo perdido muchísima plata y tiempo comprando mal casi toda mi ropa toda mi vida, así que apoyo el contenido de este muchacho que nos viene de algún modo u otro a solucionar al menos la cuestión de la vestimenta."
1,I'm curious on wher you got your eyeglasses
0,Love the video. Would love to see one for a budget work life. Maybe a polo or nice button up for the blazer. Also I have trouble finding  shoes that work for me. Black Converse are the only things I have ever found to be somewhat clean and stylish.

In no way is this blazer ""Tailored"""

0,👏👏👏
0,Where is your Chinese porcelain vase from? I love it!!!
0,"I always enjoy conversations about minimalism. However, there are some obvious cons to this lifestyle that are worth mentioning. If you don't mind wearing the same article of clothing for several days or until it starts to smell, then minimalism is the right fit for you. 
I have a very hard time wearing the same outfit if I sweat through it all day. I know it is mostly mental but I am just being honest with myself. Also, the hardest damage done to clothing is running them through the laundry. This is regardless of how delicate you are with them. The less items you own and wear, the more you will end up washing (facts).

PS: @Tim Dessaint I love to see your style influences but can you also inject some videos about current brands you are shopping on right now? Or I would LOVE to see another series of what people wear in your streets. Keep up the great content man!"

Not maksimalism per say but the fact when you have only a few pieces how it can get very boring very quck especially if you are a person like me that expresses their mood and mental state trough fashion and how to hit that sweet spot and scratch almost every fashion itch

0,You dont live in a hot climate huh?
0,Great video Tim. Loving the new direction for the channel.
2,"I’d love to have a capsule wardrobe, but it’s impossible for me. Right now, I have around 15 t-shirts, 15 button downs and polos, 10 jackets, 10 pants/jeans, 10 pairs of shoes, and 2 suits. The issue for me is that I wear everything I have. Everything I have serves a purpose. I have jackets that I’ve invested in that I’ve had for years now. I have some shoes that I’ve had for years. The suits I’ve had for years. For me, I used to mainly run through pants and jeans until I started buying Uniqlo where they have size adjustable waistlines. I still run through t-shirts as I have shirts for working out, so they don’t last, and just casual t-shirts for going out or doing projects with that deteriorate after a few months. I need to start investing in better quality t-shirts, but it’s hard to pay $80 for a 72-hour Proof shirt or a $60 Buck Mason shirt, when I can buy a cheap Uniqlo shirt for $20."
0,unc is back
2,The oversized tees look is out bruh.
0,You wear so many easily stained colors 😢 how do you keep them so clean

0,"Your tattoos are tacky, tasteless, trashy, like a nice building trashed with graffiti and I don't care if it's the greatest artist who did the graffiti."
6,I don't like oversized t-shirts because they make your arms appear smaller. Not a good look.
5,Feels like clothes are overcompensating from the super skinny era to now being way too baggy and loose. I think it's better to have more regular sized fit personally with some exceptions. Otherwise it just feels like you're wearing your big brother's clothes or found something in lost property
0,#BRAVO    My 11:  2pr. of pants or 2 skirts.  5 tops. 1 blazer.  ! duster.  2pr. of shoes.  Your tee-shirt is genius!
0,"Any recommendations for a double breasted version of the Le 17 Septembre Blazer? I find that the blazer is already perfect but personally more of a fan of double breasted blazers, coats and the lot"
0,The elastic on the sweatpants is so off putting! Everything else looks really good
1,"Bro this is so out dated 
Oversized tee has to go 
Oversized blazers looks ugly 
Those loafers so uncomfortable"
51,"Oversized blazers never look good on us dudes imo. Looks like ""I got this from my dad in three sizes too large"" and not like a proper oversized fit t-shirt for example.  Outfit 3 would looks SO much better with a normal fitting blazer, to contrast from the wider pants."
123,Do more of this type of content Tim this is what we want to see

When I was younger I would shave with plastic razors like Gillette but now with my safety razors you can get a nice smooth shave. A nice razor, some proraso shaving  cream and a nice after shave really does the job. Makes you feel like a new man"

0,I think bro likes leather
0,"Nice to see I already surrounded myself with most of the stuff in the video 😇 I totally agree with you: the real luxury is not flounting your Goyard or Vuitton around the town, but enjoying a quiet moment at home, in the evening, wholly for yourself, with an object you truly appreciate, even if it was a cheap tchatchke from the flea market... May I add another couple of things that would style greatly with the rest of it: real old Victorian cutlery can be bought on the ebay for no money at all and usually works well because of bigger dimensions than modern one. Also, may I suggest the antique Royal Copenhagen china (for example Blue Flower) which is also very inexpensive on the ebay (particularly compared with their current stuff...) and just imagine the nice feeling of reusing and enjoying something a real craftsman or woman made 60-100 years ago. (BTW: tell your guests, while they are eating, that they are eating from antique porcelain... The wowed faces will not go away for a long time 😇)"

3,"For me personally, I’d have to say 3 things :

1-Becoming the owner of my dream dog, my golden retriever is a great luxury as it brings spontaneity in my everyday life.
2- A decent espresso machine ; I recently scored a whooping 60% off on my Breville Barista Express and as it’s something I use multiple times a day, it’s a joy to have coffee shop level coffee at home.
3-Owning a quality agenda makes my life more organized, both personally and professionally. I discovered moleskine from journalling and this year upgraded from your standard cheap agenda to the moleskine and it’s a game changer."

In fact, I am very disappointed with Chanel's poor quality in recent years and their customer service is terrible. The fakes look good at the moment"

My personal luxury is sandalwood shaving cream from Taylor of Old Bond Street, a gentleman's purveyor of shaving accoutrements since the 19th century.  By the way, I disagree about the passport cover.  I just find them a faff when traveling.  My approach is to take a jacket for traveling, which gives me a place for passports, boarding pass, phone, etc.  I just take it off, fold it gently in half and lay it in the security tray with everything still in it."

I agree that thick plush towels are to die for, a female friend of mine educated me on this many years ago, and I have never looked back. For me, since I read various magazines, having a nice magazine rack would be awesome, also I enjoy cooking, nice cookware could be fine as well!"

Just a side note as well: Don't use candles, they are very toxic for the air you breathe, it's very bad for you(don't let the ""luxury"" ones fool you either, they are just as harmful) look it up. If you do want a real luxury experience,  just look into a good quality air purifier with a legit HEPA filter in it, and you should actually have better air quality, rather than mask it with a ""nice"" scent.

Considering we live in 2025 the only thing I'd add - all you mentioned, but buy second hand (maybe not the shoes). There is enough stuff out there in this world. We should start using what is already out there. Including cars and fashion. Tech and something personal like shoes I agree, but we just have enough of everything..."

Since than, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely❤️"

0,"You make a lot of good examples! I really enjoy using well-made, thoughtfully designed products—there’s something satisfying about interacting with items that are clearly engineered with care. As a software engineer working from home, comfort and efficiency matter a lot to me. A custom-built mechanical keyboard, a quality mouse and pad, a supportive chair, height-adjustable desk, solid monitors, and good speakers or headphones (plus a decent DAC/amp stack) all form the foundation of my workspace.

My day always starts with coffee, so great beans and a reliable grinder are a must. I also use an Ember mug—it’s such a small thing, but keeping your coffee at the perfect temperature really does make a difference.

I’m not super into fashion, but most of my clothes come from Uniqlo. I prefer their clean, minimal designs and solid fabrics over overpriced branded stuff with mediocre quality. It just looks better and feels better to wear.

Outside of work, I lift regularly, so having proper shoes, straps, and a lifting belt has been really helpful.

That said, none of this stuff is *necessary*—you can absolutely get by with much cheaper alternatives. But living frugally, without kids or debt, does free up some room to enjoy little luxuries like these."

4,"A high quality metal water bottle was a gamechanger for me. I found it after one person forgot it after an event, I tried my best to find the owner and return it, but couldn't, so I decided to keep it. The feeling of icy cold water bottle as you are drinking chilling water after you wake up is just beautiful. I only used thermoses before, but they were uncomfortable, cuz most of the times I didn't really need to keep the temp of the drink (as it was mostly water), and metal water bottle was a perfect balance"

0,"i've unknowingly did most of these without realizing until now... I did it out of necessity of living in a small studio apartment, having friends over constantly and working from home often. 
I couldn't get big luxury things, so I went with small luxuries with this sort of stuff, because I hated how small my space was and found joy in small luxuries in my daily life, guests appreciate it as well!"

1,"Lovely video, definitely got some great inspiration out of it. Something that I would add is a nice premium notebook like Moleskine or Leuchtturm1917 combined with a pen that you love the most. My preference is a fountain pen at home and a ballpoint on the go. For the most premium feel I'd always go for Montblanc, they have an unbeatable catalog of writing instruments and stationary."
5,"Loved this video. It showed me things i never even realized existed that really got my attention. 

A simple luxury for me is having a nice coaster for your drinks in your home. They can make a great impression on guests and elevate the living space."

3,"The watch case is a huge upgrade for any watch owner. Make sure to get one with a drawer on the bottom. You can use it to store jewelry or additional straps. I also put my car fob in there. I don't use wallets, but a flat one would also fit in there. Each time I leave the home I have one place with all the essential stuff I need."

Fancy metal shaker bottle (Shakesphere) with the blender top

0,"Your video came across my feed today. First time!  
I love the aesthetic and vibe!  Your list of little luxuries is spot on.  A couple of mine include:  Dyptique Eau Nabati parfum (cousin of Byredo - and yes, I love Byredo Black Saffron), Moleskine (day planner & Kaweco pen) and Aesops (mostly their body wash/soaps).  I am also a big fan of the quiet luxury brand Bally.  Excellent quality, well designed and not everyone has it.  I look forward to your other vids."

7,This video has been audioally and visually satisfying. Thank you.
0,"ok giving my 2 cents here, 
the only things i fully agree with are the underwear, personal fragrance,card holder/waller (this is in order). i feel like those are the things worth spending money on. . if you have money left to spend, i'd go with these ones only after trying it out.
other optional ones are headphoens, towel, candle and a watch. obviously there are budget ones which give wayy more for the price. and a watch, i believe u should buy it to commemorate an occasion, or to remember someone buy (especially your beater/most frequently used). i believe the same case is with Tim's throw. since his gf gave it, it holds a special place in his heart.
others, i personally don't give a fuck"
1,"I can tick off the majority of your selections and completely agree, they all add a level of luxury.

For me, my SONOS setup for my living room for movies and TV and my conservatory for music….Deezer and vinyl  which I have just started collecting.

Another, is something I love, but because I am growing out my beard…isn’t something I do much of anymore and that’s shaving with a great cream and safety razor finishing off with a quality balm and fragrance……absolute luxury for us guys!!!!"

0,"Great video and a rule I have followed for quite some time. Josh at Good Art Hlywd coined the term Every Day Luxury Carry (EDLC). Why not have the things you use every day give you a feeling of joy? Luxury is not a thing, it is how something makes you feel."
1,"My favorite luxury items are my phone, a tea mug, nice fragrance, warm slippers in winter and a quality towel. Tried to buy leather key chain but didn't like it at all, returned to simple ring. Also tried premium leather slim wallet but returned to ultra slim polyester wallet for minimalist."

Some of my favorite quiet  luxuries that elevate my daily life is

My coffee set up.  A good grinder , kettle, good thermos  and coffee pour over (Hario v60) had made me excited to drink my coffee  every morning


Another luxury for me is my speakers . I love music and television. So having a good speakers  for my tv had made me really enjoy albums and television way more

Lastly is my computer set up. I work from home and on my desk for 6+ hours a day for most of the week. Having a good desk (standing , length , etc) and good periphals such as good keyboard and mouse and a monitor  had really made work much more enjoyable and productive ."

1,Best luxury is in the very little tools that you are using daily. Invest in a set of nail clippers and accessories from Green Bells is the best since they are the Rolls Royce of clippers and last for forever. What was the brand of your bath towels? I tried brooks linen but they are just full of lints

3,"*The towel supplier is Frette* - for anyone wondering. They started in 1860. Apparently they are the exclusive supplier for Ritz hotels.

Hey Tim, I’ve been subscribed to you for 6 years now and always appreciated your focus on mindful consumption and lately also downsizing.
However, I feel a bit conflicted seeing the collaboration with Skims, given their environmental and ethical practices. It feels at odds with the values you’ve shared in the past.

- Skims has no slave statement on their website
- The packaging stating ""I am not plastic"" actually contains plastic
- Skims supplychain and final production stage isn't transparent
- They joined the Fair Labor Association but fail to provide actual evidence of good working conditions and or livable wages for workers in Skims's supply chain

Speaking about quiet or ""little"" luxury in contrast to that last bullet point is something that feels very off. ✌"
1,An nice tin for mints or gum in your daily is so elevated. Thank me later when you get compliments!!!
0,The towels shout is dangerous once you use a nice quality thick towel and then use a thin one again it wont feel the same a nice towel is worth every dime
43,"Luxury board game, just laid on the coffee table. Tell me you don’t have kids without telling me you don’t have kids… 😉 In all seriousness, great list. Agree with pretty much everything on there. A great watch, fragrance and good socks are my “king signals”."
0,Good quality bed sheets…. Dreamy !!
295,"The best thing I’ve bought for everyday luxury is my coffee machine. It wasn’t cheap to start with, but after four years of great coffee at home, I’ve definitely saved compared to all those cafe trips. That, and strapping on a good watch every morning - just sets the tone for the day."

0,"I spend good money on coffee and tea. 

I have a local coffee roaster that has a great espresso blend and also will roast up some very interesting light roasts for my pour over. 

For tea, i get pu erh from an importer. 

Both expensive, but very well worth it."

4,"Nice video, Tim!  I just wanted to suggest that having a passport cover is not overly helpful in my experience- you regularly have to take your passport out of it, every time you hand it over.  I find having a Bellroy travel wallet with a passport slot in it much more useful.  It doesn't hold your boarding pass, but I keep those in my sports jacket and it works very well.  I'd suggest you take a look!"

For example, I've started making my latte in the morning instead of hitting the Starbucks drive-through."

0,🙌
0,"The ONLY ""perfect"" shirt (T-Shirt or otherwise) is a custom tailored one. As for T-Shirts you can easily zero in on the fabric type, but the fit regardless of brand, cut, etc is ALWAYS going to be subjective due to too many variations in body types. I like both loose generous (wear as stand alone), and slim athletic fitted cuts (wear standalone or under sport coat, sweater, etc). I like to have T-shirts of both types. This looks like the perfect loose cut shirt 👍🏽"
0,This T-shirt look sicj but the price ain't it. This is too expensive for a white t shirt
0,I found my perfect white tee at Sunspel.  I have their Supima Cotton-Jersey tee and it's just perfect in my book.  I've washed it twice and all is well so far.  It's silky smooth out of the box and has stayed that way after washing.  High GSM though I don't know the count.  It's a regular fit and I use it for layering.  About $130 USD.  I'm glad you were able to make yours.
0,"I'm portuguese, its known that we make the best t shirts here but for some reason portuguese brands are always more expensive than international brands, it doesnt make sense. And now portuguese clothing brands turned into asia for making their clothing, insane..."
0,im sorry but its so funny you chose a white background to show off the white tee and its just dissapearing into the background lmao. But from what i can see the shirt does look good!
0,Due to their blind trust upon the customers fashion houses order large number of clothes every year. Sometimes they remain unsuccessful to sell them for years. But they can throw a trend called dropped shoulder which will catch customers rapidly. So that the businessmen can get rid of their losses by selling oversized products to the markets.

0,"the way the sleeves are extended makes it look like they added it at last second, personally I find it of bad taste, not a fan of the oversize fit either but to each their own.
pima cotton is ok although MicroModal feels like silk but better and it's more breathable, feels luxurious and doesn't need fabric softener to keep feeling like that"
0,"It sure looks like a million bucks T, but I still see problems with this when it comes to selling. I 'd say that you cannot (or should not) be launching products based on your own styling preference. I can see that Tim has been overwhelmed with the ""boxy"" ""oversized"" ""relaxed fit""  ""dropped shoulders"". These are your preference, and it's not good when you sell them just because you wear them. It's like my one friend who loves italian foods so much, ended up opening his own italian restaurant, hoping people will enjoy them just like he did. It's not that people can't afford a $100 T. We've seen people who paid wayyy more for a doormat of a shirt. So pricing is subjective to me. People pay for what they want how they wanted. But when it comes to selling, you should not be using your own opinion/preference as a based idea. I'd say go for a more traditional fit, timeless fit, the fit that anyone can shine through. Because FIT IS KING."

0,"The way it drapes on you, it looks a slight tat heavier than 295gsm. Maybe 310 to 320 gsm"
4,"$125 for a white tee, $250 for grey sweats. You’re fucking high dude."
0,The length of the tshirt has to follow the rule of thirds for me
0,Oh no wonder there has not been time for more than one video per month cos all the time that designing a t-shirt takes☺️
0,I do hope it comes back in stock soon!
1,Too long and wide. This man used to dress much better when he didn't wear such baggy clothes.
1,"ripping people off with that pricing.
airism is more than good enough. thanks."
1,respectfully submitted >> That shirt does NOT fit you. Like at all. Like you look like a 9 year old in someone's hand me down.
0,Now do a black one!
32,"I’m hesitant for 2 reasons. First, it is not “6x better” than Airism as the price suggests. Second, I see that you priced it around other higher end white tees, but the difference is they’re known quantities with proven track record to command $100+ price tag, you on the other hand are a startup just entering the market."
0,crazy how passion produces magic 🖤🖤
0,Next challenge: make a cheaper alternative to this and appeal to 2 different demographics ones that can afford the premium and one for the people who can't more kind of like FOG and FOG essentials
4,Far from perfect. The sleeves ruin the look.
12,"Get real bro, no plain white t shirt is worth over $100. Don’t abuse the audience that you have."
15,147$ for white tee is a crazy work...... whats the cost to make one?
4,"Anything looks good on you when you are jacked, shoulda spent those two years in the gym bud"
0,Fit is king thrown out the window
0,Wow it sold out!
1,Where are your glasses from?
22,107 dollar a T-shirt lol
8,"Salut Tim,

Je commence en te disant que j'adore vraiment tes vidéos. Elles m'ont permis d'élever mon propre style et d'affiner ma connaissance sur les vêtements en général. J'avais hâte de pouvoir acheter un des vêtements de ta collection, surtout pour soutenir ton travail et récompenser les efforts que tu as mis dans la marque. 
Cependant, en voyant les prix, je me suis vite refroidi. J'avoue que payer près de 100 euros pour un t-shirt blanc, par principe, je ne peux pas. Je ne connais pas l'ensemble des coûts que tu as dû payer pour lancer ta marque et produire les vêtements. J'imagine qu'en produisant des vêtements de qualité avec la vision exacte que tu veux, cela a un certain prix, mais je trouve cela quand même trop cher.

J'espère qu'à l'avenir les prix seront un peu plus abordables. Dans tous les cas, je continuerai de suivre tes vidéos avec assiduité et je te souhaite beaucoup de réussite pour ta marque et tes projets futurs !"
57,Your collection is expensive 😢very expensive
0,anyone have any tips of keeping the collar of the white tees clean? my white tees always end up browning/yellowing
4,As much I’d like to support but nope with ‘em’ price for a plain white tee. I’ll stick with Uniqlo. I’m sure they’re both the same after a couple washes.
2,holy balls that's expensive
3,"$227 + $38 shipping is quite steep for one hoodie. That being said, I still bought it so idk."
3,"I am sure the white tee is very, very nice, but at 100 dollars, I just cannot pull the trigger. I dont wanna be coming back and spend a few hundred bucks more to get a few more, every 6 months. Call me cheap 😂 I will just stick with the U brand."
0,"""How it feels to chew 5 gum"""
4,The prices....Dude...
0,Saw you at the Singapore mall today
1,"perfect shirt for you, not for everyone"
0,Did you ever try t-shirts by Wonder Looper?
0,Tryna be soulja boy in 08
0,"Oh my gosh, love this. This shit is IT."
0,"love watching all you're videos
from, Philippines 🇨🇿"
0,💪🏻
0,"No such thing as perfect, this is most likely biased towards Tim."
1,"Well, it looks great tbh—I can see the Japanese influence. It’s definitely not for everyone, but with 295 GSM, Pima cotton, made in Portugal, and small batch production, I’m quite sure it’s going to be around or close to €100. That’s a lot for a T-shirt for a regular person. But hey, it’s not fast fashion.
I just hope the price is reasonable—for both you and the customer. People will definitely complain, but since you didn’t cut corners, the higher price makes sense. I just don’t think the average person realizes how much 'made in Europe', high GSM Pima, small batch production, logistics, and marketing push the cost up. Maybe you could’ve talked about that a bit? Idk"
0,"I'm looking forward to the launch! But, I'd also like to know more about the beautifully offensive vase in the background."
0,Need it.
0,Congrats!!!
0,Bro can't wait to buy this
19,"Congrats Tim! As someone who basically never wears white tees but wears black tees daily, make this in black next and I will immediately buy 10."
1,"dont like how dropped the shoulders are, would personally cut it back by 2-3cm and put that fabric into the sleeves instead. but appreciate all the details put into the tee regardless, great effort from someone i learnt fashion from and admire."
1,Think I'll stick with Uniqlo... looks way too oversized with the shoulder stitching mid bicep
0,Please a white dress shirt 👔 I’m still looking for a good one to just wear casually. Most of them are see through or to heavy. But great video !
1,Dessaint AIRism Oversized white-tee
0,Can you make a video about sweater vests??
0,Get this one out now!!
0,Would it be available in Asia?
3,"""I wasted 2 years of my life doing something absolutely forgettable and meaningless"""
0,Wow this is so inspiring. Let me set my alarm now
0,I love it
0,Congrats Tim 🎉
1,"Watching this video makes I feel like you know my mind. When exactly is just that our style is exactly the same when it comes to t shirt.
1. Boxy fit/oversize fit
2. Not shrink when wash (love airsim uniqlo but it just shrunk in length and looks weird after all)
3. Just the right length of sleeve 
4. The collar is wrap around your neck rather than too big collar and ends up sliding off to one side of the shoulder 
5. The size of asian men who is not 6ft or 180 cm
6. Heavyweight enough but not too much so it is still looks soft on appearance

Looking for your drop! (And may be darker color like navy or black as well in the future😊)"
0,Can you do a fitted version?
0,Live it for sure
0,what hoodie is he wearing
0,Totally understand the want and need to make your own brand for products you feel arent up to snuff. I currently am finding it near impossible to get a slim fit white tee without major concessions. Might have to just take my favourite oversized tee and get it tailored to slim fit. But mad respect for your own clothing line. Looking forward to the drop.
0,take my money!
2,The sleeves looks a bit odd.. uniqlo one is better
0,Very exciting
0,Well done TIM.
0,"I love it! Especially the sleeves length. I am Uniqlo M for unisex t-shirt, but I have one of the airism tee in XXL, it wears similar to this sleeves' length. When tucked in to natural or high waist bottoms, where the sleeves cut draws perfect attention to the waist. It's going to look great, I hope I can afford to get one!"
0,I love how people can tirelessly nerd about something – looking forward to the shirt!
0,"5’9”, 195 lbs, yoked—what size do I order?"
1,"this looks exactly like how anime art depicts fabric, amazing"
0,Very niche. Let's see if he makes something more fitted or not. This would make me look like a kid wearing my dad's clothes.
0,Does it come in black
0,Dessaint is a great name for a fashion brand ngl
2,Meh
0,Congratulations on this incredible milestone!
3,make one with less dropped shoulders (like the airism)
0,Great video and congrats! But it’s still just a white T-shirt that is ubiquitous.
0,Congrats man!
1,love it bro looks really good! big fan of the longer sleeves
1,Too Long + Sleeves too Long - a Bit disappointed tbh
0,if you make a black T with the same silhouette im in
0,I have been watching you for a very very long time now my style is very similar to yours I am very happy that you started this brand. And wishing you good luck ahead
0,"This is my exact problem, but with black t-shirts"
1,i love how he realizes how ridiculcous this sounds but well its a hobby so its fine i guess
0,That Shirt in a comparison to the uniqlo would be Sick
0,Yea I think you can make some variants with that fabric. Finding good quality T-shirt is soooo hard
2,Rip 2 years for that
0,Looks sooo good! Will it be available in black ? 😂
0,The product is impressive. Hoping for more colors 🙌👏
0,Love the Price!
0,Couldn't be more excited for a white t-shirt lol. I can already tell the branding Is on point.
0,It's beautiful 🥲
0,Congrats !
3,"Airism oversized really only had 2 problems.

1. Poor collar
2. Staining

That was literally just it. And funnily enough I think Uniqlo has a women's airism tee that has the thicker stretchy collar. Uniqlo does update points for their products so I think either Uniqlo doesn't think it needs to change the collar or there's just that much stock of it they need to burn through first."
0,I like those shorts. what are they?
0,PERFECT
0,"Same t-Shirt like you made heavy and oversized but cropp style, I bought in Zara last year for 22€"
0,"Can't wait for the t-shirt. Also, what was the cardigan in the thumbnail please?"
0,Looking forward to it.
0,Wow😮
2,recreating the lemaire boxy t-shirt after 2 years🤔
0,Yo Tim been watching you for like half a year now you’ve helped me a lot with how to dress especially as most the popular creators I see don’t live in England so it’s a bit of a different place where they live compared to me so glad I found your channel congrats on you releasing your own brand hopefully I can get my hands on the white T once it drops much love brother ❤🎉🙌
1,"Everything was going good until you went with drop shoulders and long sleeve, there are lot of us who do not like that and its ok please make an alternate with fit smaller sleeves, hugged perfect shoulder"
0,black
0,Can you give the sizing chart before launch?
0,how much?
2,"as long as the shirt doesn’t cost more than $20, we’re buying"
0,dessaint 😮‍💨 damn that's hot
0,we all saw this coming
1,we all knew this was gonna hapen
0,I hope this is not limited times item
0,Everything is perfect except the 290GSM weight
0,"i have a 100% cotton heavyweight white tee by Luke 1977 which I really love in a size L, nice oversized fit (I am usually S and M)"
0,"I like the weight, the material and the collar. I wish the sleeves were a bit shorter and the length slightly more cropped. That would be my perfect white t shirt 😅😅"
5,"I’ve been waiting for Uniqlo to make a 100% natural fiber oversized shirt, thank you for making it happen!! I hope it’s slightly cropped tho"
0,"awesome, hopefully it doesn't cost $200 so I can yoink one :)"
0,"Didn't see it coming, but it seems so logic after all! Your journey is really inspiring, and I really respect your approach to fashion - being authentic, and willing to provide interesting insights
GRAND AESTHETIC"
0,"PLEASE don't pull an nvidia, do your best so that not everything is sold out in the first 2 hours"
1,Awesome and sleek
6,"I feel like if you went to this much effort perfecting a single cut of a T-Shirt it would surely be worth making it in black too.
A classic fit one would be awesome too but I get it, you're building a business slowly and learning the proces, it would be death if you tried to handle even 4 different items for a first time, and if it had to be just one product then what better than the oversized white tee. It embodies your brand, it's perfect.
Learning how to run a business logistics and everything would be a nightmare for a first timer but by just running one product eveything seems simpler, glad you're doing it this way."
2,he's definitely the strongest white t-shirt enjoyer in the world
0,You're amazing!
0,Can’t wait
0,Amazing news Tim! Genuinely got me emotional with the announcement. Good luck!
0,Class👌✨
0,Thats a great news… love your videos and I have also been waiting for a good white T for so so long
0,Congrats sir tim
1,"I’m sure the shirt will be great but with that sort of material, ethical practices with manufacturing and the costs of starting a new brand, this shirt is probably gonna cost way too much"
1,Only for $150😂😂😂
1,Longer short sleeves makes a person look extremely short and hunchy. Even a mid tshirt with well fitted sleeves with the right length looks tidy and smart
1,im never a fan of oversized shirt
2,"Have you tried it on taller people? like 185, 80kg?"
0,Tell that the neck is slighly larger then the Uniqlo one please...
0,tshirt looks so sick
1,Congrats 👏👏👏
0,Being so passionate about something that you create your own version of it is such a beautiful thing 👏
0,"for me, the perfect blend would be if the Uniqlo Airism Tshirt and the COS Oversized Heavyweight Tshirt had a baby

this would have been it…if the sleeves and shoulder were just a bit shorter

the shoulder drop and sleeve being too low makes it look like I’m borrowing my big brother’s tshirt vs wearing an oversized tee

but I’m excited to see how it translates in real life wear"
0,"Salut Tim, les commandes venant de france on aura les shipping fees à payer ?"
0,"Next classic t - a tiny bit of dropped shoulders to give room and not look like a minecraft character, sleeves that hug the arm but not too much, should not be tight. Collar that is not too big and always stays put, and a little bit shorter to fall just at the top part of the ass"
0,Had 2 comments deleted by the YT bots. Does anyone else get 2 results on the other platform when they search with @dessaint...... as mentioned in this video and in the description?
1,We want regular fit
0,Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉
0,"Try Aton 12/- Air Spinning | Oversized S/S T-Shirt, fits me perfectly"
0,"oversize and boxy is an understatement 😊, sleeve too long, yeah it looks good dont get me wrong but for me the perfect white tee should be timeless, i mean you can only get away with this tee if you wear oversize pants which is the trend right now. Its like a rapper/hip hop fit. Uniqlo tee much better/versatile than this, fit-wise."
0,🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
0,ID on the Pleated Sweats in the shirt reveal?
0,After several wash?
0,"Fashion swings between tailored/skinny to relaxed/oversized and everything in between every so often. traditional/straight fit clothes always work, and they're not boring if you're thoughtful with putting simple outfits together. This shirt looks great, but I think it'd wind up in a box in my closet before 2030. There are already signs that the oversized trend is becoming toned down."
3,If this costs more than $40 than it’s instantly worthless
0,Good job Tim! more success and more awesome creation in the future. big fan here of your wardrobe collections.
0,Looks like raglan....the sleeves to narrow for that length....
1,Congrats on the launch!
1,Nope
1,Bodylength should have been shorter
0,The sleeves are long😂 af
1,"Oh no, it's a poncho"
0,i followed tim when he was just posting skincare routines. now he has a clothing line. absolute king
3,The problem is it’s the perfect white tee for you.
1,"This is far from perfect. The drop in the shoulders is so pronounced, you might as well wear a bag as a torso. There is something extremely pretentious and arrogant about proclaiming perfect when you’re a newbie in a saturated industry. The airism tee works because of the fit and fabric. The polyester and the placement of the drop shoulders is just right, and was probably a product of countless man hours and iterative testing. 

Wish you luck on your brand, but the angle you’re taking here will not land, in my opinion."
0,🔥🔥🫡
3,"Still not perfect dude,u need to work harder"
0,Congrats Tim! Will there be shipping to Canada?
0,But you have not tested ascolour or hanes beefy. Those two are classic.
0,"Finally! Exciting news, indeed! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤"
0,Looks great to me! Not that oversized
0,"I don't like loose t-shirts, they make your arms look small."
0,ID on the hoodie?
0,Good luck with it Tim. Yes I first came across with this white T comparisons when you lived in the best country and city in the world
0,Who makes the glasses you are wearing??
0,"Good luck with the brand..t shirt is too short, sleeves way to long for me though, im on a hunt for a regular fit heavyweight t shirt, seems they all come in boxy and oversized"
1,"Congrats man, the shirt looks incredible!"
7,Looks nice. It’d be cool if you could also make a fitted cropped tee for another collection
0,bro locked in 🤝
0,Will it yellow though? The airism one yellows after several washes
0,"I have a few questions. Is it a unisex t-shirt? i tend to wear more mens clothes or more unisex fits because they fit my body better. Second, if so, how small will it go because for uniqlo's oversized t-shirts, i wear an xxs (I'm a very tiny woman). And lastly, pricing, how is it going to be priced? With all the USA bs going on right now with the tariffs, idk if I'll be able to afford it, and usually, i can only afford the uniglo t-shirt when it's on sale. But all in all i like the look of it, and congrats on your brand!"
3,Doesn't look as good as the Uniqlo one tbh
0,"Im so happy that you chose to go with the highest quality fabric for this. Only thing id personally change is making it a cotton/linen blend for even better natural breathability. Nonetheless, im definitely buying a couple tee’s myself."
4,"Damn bro gg for this journey, must’ve been a ton of work. I would love to buy one but even though im a fan of japanese fashion and oversized silhouettes the sleeves are dropping waaaay too much under the shoulders… ill think about it and hope you release a V2 because it seems a lot of people have the same concerns here."
3,I’m PRAYING that this shirt comes in black 🙏🏽
0,Please don't do a Daniel Simmons on pricing!!
0,Too oversized for me! I hope you have an XS so I can downsize from S
0,tim. send me 5 and i’ll send the cash RIGHT NOW.
2,"Boxy tees are so overplayed now, back to fit tees please"
0,Next is shoes and accessories ❤
0,Is the length long?
0,The grey hoodie you're wearing is it your brand?
0,"The tee looks good due to the intentional fit. it's not a boring slim fit yuo could get from any other brand, but not too wide that you would need to buy seperate pants for it."
0,I hope the price is ok
5,Mate I've been waiting for you to do this congratulations mate
0,"also recommend Uniqlo U Tee, cheap and durable"
17,"ive been looking for a certain brand that just puts tremendous effort into every single piece of clothes they release and rather not make a piece than make a supoptimal one. i have not yet found a brand that does this, but i have feeling dessaint might be IT. Looking forward!"
1,We already have Merz B as the perfect white tee. What you need is to get fit so you don’t gotta hide in those oversized tees like you a baby.
0,I release the airism from uni… oh wait
0,That looks and sounds great! If it fits my budget I'll definitely get it~
0,Wow... just Wow . Congrats ❤
0,Perfect for my beer gut and pot belly
0,Too long? Maybe 2 lengths 🙏🏼
0,Hopefully he will have a few shapes and styles 🤞🏼
1,Great job Tim! Personally I would've wished for shorter sleeves but hey - maybe the 2.0 will bring it ;)
0,"Bro said ""Fine, I'll do it myself"""
0,"Please consider coming out with a square, classic fit in the future too!"
0,You KNEW what we’d want. I’m so so happy for you and for us LMAOOOO. I’m ready to have this in my hands!!!
0,Nice shirt. I’m a shorter guy though so I wish the sleeves weren’t as long. Maybe future designs?
0,"Grey, black?"
0,Shipping to Germany?
1,love this exactly my style
0,Which brand is that hoodie you are wearing Tim?
0,Price?
0,Congrats and can't wait to get my hands on your products!!!
0,This is a goofy looking shirt
1,This looks cool. Excited to see the rest of the stuff! Hopefully I can get my hands on some of it
0,That's soooo amazing! Congrats. Hope they'll be available to ship to GER. Would love to get one for my husband 🎉🎉
0,OVER size Tees makes a person look short though...
0,Capri sleeves
0,Hi Tim what hoodie where u wearing in today video please respond because i think it looks good thx in advanced.
0,Pretty ❤
0,Hoping for a muscle tee version down the line. I trust your vision and commitment to quality.
2,I've been waiting for this for years. Congrats!
0,although this channel is centered around minimalistic clothing some nice text kinda like allsaints tshirt would go hard
0,Nice bro can’t wait!
53,"the most heavenly white tee ive ever seen

but in terms of consumer preferences you should also release a slim fit version/regular fit with shorter sleeves"
0,I’m so proud of your journey. I’ll buy your merch.
0,Looks awesome! Would love for you to work on a standard fit for those of us who don’t prefer the oversized style—I would absolutely be a customer. Congrats on an exciting new chapter!
0,"Actually the Uniqlo Shirt for me is already perfect when it comes to oversized shirts, this one is too oversized for my taste."
0,Make a black one
0,On standby to purchase!
105,"Some people are saying it's too oversized and the sleeves are too long. I've been a fan of more generous Japanese silhouettes for a long time and the Uniqlo shirt doesn't quite hit that spot for me but this one does. I already know I'm too broke to buy it but I'm glad you took the step to make the perfect white t-shirt. At least in the visual department, you succeeded in my book."
0,congrats on Uniqlo Airism...
0,Look forward to the launch. Congratulations on the brand
0,Uniqlo punching air right now Tim 😂
22,Oversized is done for me when it comes to shirts. I been working out arms more so I'm now wearing shorter sleeves
0,I finally bought the white Uniqlo oversized T and was so sad you could see my nips through the shirt :(
2,It finally all comes down to this. I am truly excited to see your brand flourish.
2,"Sometime just 1% or 2% of polyester is good, so your t-shirt doesn't shrink. The 100% coton is not always good"
0,You sell those in Eu?
0,White T Tim
0,"Make it the right price that all white tshirts should be, $5 and you’ll sell a billion"
0,"Im calling it now, will cost at minimum $75"
0,"When it comes out I’ll give it a try in Houston’s hot weather. I have a feeling it’s probably not gonna go that well, haha. I have some Japanese tshirt like Nautica,  Beams, Nanamica, TNF purple label, but I always go back to airism tshirt"
5,"Everything seems like a great idea, but if you could make a version with less drop shoulders/shorter sleeves, that would be awesome, also how do these shrink once washed?  Thats a key question i always ask for tee’s"
2,Can’t wait for it to be too expensive for me 😂
0,"Congrats man. I see a lot of people giving out suggestions for different pieces, I was wondering (before I even say) if you were interested in suggestions for different pieces / takes on pieces?"
1,Looks good man! Unfortunately oversized is not really my style. Since I workout it would cover the gains lol. Any chance you'll make a regular version?
0,wauuu
1,"Not trying to hate, but I feel like this t-shirt isn't good for everyday wear as time goes on, it's kind of standing on the ""trend"" side of t-shirts. I think a more tailored fit with shorter sleeves that also can be used as an undershirt for jackets is much better suited for most people. If you do end up making a version like this, I would be totally down to buy one."
0,Too oversize for me
0,"It would be great to know what the sizing is like compared to the Uniqlo tee that everyone knows so well. Just so that I don't have to order multiple sizes and return the ones that don't fit. If I know your medium is that same sort of size as Uniqlo's medium for example, I will defo buy some."
0,Congratulations on finally starting your brand! I will be buying on launch day 4/26
1,Honestly excited for this to drop!
0,I would really appreciate an updatet tattoo tour!
0,Make a slim fit for some of us as well  please ! thank you!

1,make one with shorter sleeves and also cropped
0,"Man I discovered your channel when you first started on like reddit or something and now look at you go selling your own shirt. Congrats, Tim!"
1,"Hi, im just wondering what the prices will be. Obviously if you don't want to give a specific number could you say if its expensive or budget or middle"

0,"Finalmente, 'Tim Dessaint'"
0,"Also please continue with the outfits for summer videos, you can probably make outfit videos for each season too. 🏝"
0,"Congratulations bro. I like that you didnt just stop with your white tee but also considered putting your style into other pieces. I remember in your video way back when you were describing your style as contemporary and edgy and I was there writing all of it down cause it was like you were describing the style I had in my mind but couldn't say, and thats when I decided to stick around your channel but you did the like the 20 to like 30 outfits for summer videos and I was hooked. Proud of you my guy, hope you continue to grow into your greatness."
0,"So eager to get my hands on them!

Since it is oversized, what would you recommend in sizing?
And any indication of the potential cost?

Thank you Sir!"

1,"I'm sorry but $107 for a t-shirt is ridiculous, like this is borderline a scam."
0,I absolutely love his channel there are some excellent fashion content creators out there and he's definitely my top 5 now
2,"I have watched a number of your videos over the years, and even though my age group (I am in my 60's) is almost twice yours, I learnt the universal language of good clothes wear from you. I summarize it as structure, fibre, texture and color. Keep it balanced and understated and mostly one cannot go wrong. Variations will happen, but the basic rules apply. Not to mention the excellent compositions of your videos, which are always a delight to watch. I would like to congratulate you on your own brand start, and look forward to your onward journey. My best wishes."

0,I have the feeling that oversized clothing is a niche market.  Can he reach that market to sell his limited production then pivot to more mainstream sizing?

If you're poor, you'll end up wearing whatever you can find at H&M, you won't get these textures or such colors like in the video.
Half the looks in the video don’t have effortless vibes, in fact in real life I’d say it’s the opposite.

That said it was an interesting video."
0,Where is the number 7 joggers from????
0,"I'm sorry, but as a guy that wants to start dressing in a slightly more stylish way, but is adamant about the whole ""fashion guy"" label, I don't think any of the dudes shown in the video look ""effortless"". Specially not the guys that are overly layered, with the baggy short trouser and chunky loafers or the forcefully added beanines or caps. That screams ""LOOK AT ME! I'M COOL AND FASHIONABLE"" and completely defeats the whole ""effortless vibes""."

It can provide a look with a dynamic and  casual detail. I don’t tuck it inside the shirt, just let it hang it inside the shirt around the neck, with a loose knot just above the last fasted button with the ends outside. Tim, you have a very sympathetic attitude towards men‘s style. Cheers from Hamburg/ Europe"

Then a few hours later after sitting down and do some window shopping, your popped up with a video saying you were selling your clothing collection! And with you being the first fashion youtuber I watched, I copped you purple Fear Of God without a second thought. 

 The unexpected import fees broke me a little 😅,  but the sentimental value of it will never leave me. 

TY for all you've thought me, both in fashion and minimalism. Your a blessing."

0,What size watch do you go for with a small wrist?
2,i think single breasted jackets look way better
1,"Black out shades and fades are dated and really uninspiring these days with all the options out there. Fades are definitely well past it exept for balding blokes with low testosterone. Small watches definitely way more classy than wearing a ""clock"" on your wrist. Oversize watches have always been crass and a bit ""desperate"""
1,I had to double take for a sec! You put the one and only F1 legend Sir God The All Mighty Ayrton Senna in there! 1:36 1:36
5,“When done right” means that it’s not effortless
26,Chunky sweaters are so much better but office heating is too high. If only people just wore some warmer clothes and can save some energy on the mean time
318,"- Black leather boots
- Pleated trousers
- Tweed coats and blazers
- Buttoned up shirts with the sleeves rolled up"
0,The double breasted jacket... YEAH!
0,great video as always!
1,"Interesting list. Confused as to why talk about double breasted jackets but the first image is of a single breasted jacket?! 🤔 Double denim is always going to be controversial for sure. Happy that you included brown, as there is just something about it that elevates an outfit from the norm. Throw on a brown coat and it just makes everything better!"
1,Notice how everything is styling things that are effortles stylish
0,"Could you make a new video about shopping for the right kind of jeans, talking about brands, materials, styles, fits, etc. I want to wear jeans more but imo they are the hardest piece to shop for"
0,What brand is your brown sweater from? :)
5,"GREAT VID , unfortunately I've seen Gen-Z wearing all black out of sloppiness or being totally uncreative and uninspired (black North Face jackets upfront) so that is already a big no by now. 😶‍🌫 great tips and very well filmed 💖"
3,we need another tattoo tour vid tim
41,"Things I find effortlessly stylish.

- Chromatic pastel colors outfits.
- Outfits that pay attention to design like a knitted look or corduroy look.
- Well sewn clothing.
- Natural Fabrics
- Accessories (watch, scarf, necklace, glasses, IEMs (or earbuds), shemaghs)
- Shined leather shoes and jacket.
- Worn leather bags or shined leather bags.
- Comfortable hats with great fabric design or texture."
58,"1. Double-breasted jackets: agree
2. Double denim: disagree (controversial for a reason) (subjective)
3. Blacked-out shades: kinda agree it's a classic but very boring
4. Burgundy: agree if not overdone
5. Small watches: disagree as a watch guy. It really depends on the person and style and anything below 42mm isn't even that large
6. large scarves: sorta disagree. It works best for oversize fits. A stylish scarf isn't dependant on size but styling and quality imo
7. Grey on grey: agree if done tastefully
8.  ""Good Haircut"": agree; a fade only looks good for like 5 days though.
9.  collarless jackets: very subjective imo. High end fashion styles can be elevated by this or it can look goofy af.
10. signet rings: disagree. tad overrated. lots of people have no reason for a signet ring. It can be classy; it can look massively douchy too.
11. Big overcoats: agree, watch the length if you're shorter though.
12. Loafers: most overrated shoe in fashion rn. Agree but they can also look gaudy or goofy.
13. thin bracelets: sort of agree. understated men's jewellery is great but super thin bracelets can look very feminine (which is also fine depending on your style)
14. this is just an ad for a laptop lol
15. minimal outfit with statement bag (piece): agree
16. chocolate brown: a good choc brown is definitely timeless and can be worn by all skin tones. agree.
17. a well made unique cap: agree
18. bougie sweatpants: agree for streetwear styles but it has to be a good quality one.
19. Chunky knitwear: agree
20. Chunky shoulder padding: sorta agree
21. all black: definition of effortless. It can be super boring but agree.
22. clear frame glasses: agree but they need to be quality. People with light hair and lighter skin tones might have issues here btw.
23. Suede bags: agree
24. lived-in denims: agree if the denim is good quality.
25. Leather gloves: agree

This is just me agreeing or disagreeing which of these are ""effortlessly stylish"" btw not whether they are good fashion pieces overall"
1,"@8:50 the white hoodie, what is that? I love the design accents it has giving that knitted look."

2,Yo
0,You should try “ how to look 40’s at 31” 😅
1,"I just recently did this. Never realized how difficult it was to sell clothing, even barely used. I do feel less cluttered and I had to get over feeling ""attached"" to items that I thought had some sentimental meaning. But as you continue to declutter it gets much easier getting rid of the useless items that you never wear."
0,Hi Tim! Wardrobe update this 2025 please.
0,how many pieces of clothing do you have now?
0,"Great video Tim, I share with you the metaphor you used, we should live life with intention, total conscious of our decisions. Strong message, keep the great work man 🫰🏼"
0,when a video on how to initially approach fashion and dressing well?
1,"Hi Tim,
I bought the Represent pants from the store but I never got them delivered. Royal mail says that I could not be contacted, but there was no attempt at contacting me. 
Thanks!"
0,What you need is the AIRism Oversized Tee
0,"Hey Tim, I just wanted to ask how you found / find those nice pieces. Are you just searching around the internet or do you have specific brands you only buy from ? Or do you go out shopping ? Because as someone who lives in Germany, we don't have these shops like Cole Buxton, Fear of God, ..."
0,Please discount the rest that havent been sold 🙏
0,"I like this new ""you"" :) I stopped following you because, although I really liked the clothes to showed to us, I felt that I couldn't identify myself with your fashion tips. Two years ago I started to simplify my wardrobe, less clothes, easier to combine and only neutral colors (because I like them). I find it very simple to combinate everything, it makes my life simpler but not less fashionable. I follow you again, I am intrigued by your new stage. Greetings from Switzerland"
0,Hey can you do video on  essential clothing for a beginner  who wants to get into fashion.
0,"Just a quick question, are you selling the Brown (Cashmere?) Overcoat from uniqlo ? Haven't found it on the site :D, probs you wanna keep that piece since it's so cool. Have a good one!"
0,Please create a vid of your ultra minimalist closet after selling all of these.

0,"Dear Tim Dessant,
I just want to say damn you have grown you YT channel so much I remember the first few video with the best white t-shirt to collab with Brock crazy how you real 1,5mil subs I used to watch your video when I started with my job and 6/7years later I still enjoy your video's!"
0,i feel like decluttering my wardrobe too😭😭
0,This is by far the best channel for fashion challenged men I have ever seen.
0,"Yesterday I was thinking like, ""what if I had three jackets with primary colors, but maybe 6 to add the secondary"", and then I saw the shopping cart, and repented hard hahahaha"
0,I’ve been downsizing my wardrobe and been more focused better material and less colors.
0,Do you shipping to Thailand? I always watching and I like your clothes
0,Tim! Firts of all thank you. Now i need you to drop a Business casual guide. I'm now in a more formal setting and struggle a bit between being to casual/sport and comfy vs being to elegant. They don't do suits in my city
0,Tim tu es français? J'avais aucune idée! 😂
0,Man I’m also 31 and I’m in the exact same stage. I went through the same stages of fashion too 😅. Honestly the tipping point for me was when I started with baggy pants. Then I wanted to experiment with so many other fits and it got out of control! I’ve been so tempted to do a total clear out for the last few months too so I may well do the same! Good luck! 🤞🏽
0,next video should be about the clothing you decided to keep :) and how to style them.
6,"i think your focus on intention in your clothing is reflected in your videos. ive been following you for the last year, and you have the most spectacular intentions behind your videos. the shots, the storyboarding, the music, the framing is all so intentional and makes such an aesthetic, intentional video. keep up the great work, cant wait to see your next chapter. 💯"

1,Whats the brand/name of the jacket at 2:52? Thank you in advance/
0,Thats the neatest mess I've ever seen 😄
2,"As someone who owns an apparel brand, I gravitate to certain things, but I also realize it's totally seasonal. I'm 45, and as I'm getting older, I also find that I've begun to ""collect"" clothes...timeless styles, but different enough to keep buying...degrees of casual all the way to dressy. Let's not talk about shoes. Same story. But I've dialed in my fits and silhouettes years ago, so I'm not trying to find ""my style"" anymore...that's set in stone. Excited to see how this all unfolds for you, Tim. Cheers"
1,Please make a video building your new minimalistic wardrobe and the thought process behind it! 🙏
0,"I’m a woman but I enjoy your videos very much and certainly appreciated this one. I just hope I can start focusing more on quality over quantity but unfortunately, my weight fluctuates often due to medical issues and just about the time I thought I found my dream jeans that fit perfect, I have to go out and buy a new pair since they don’t fit anymore:("
0,So let me see if I get it straight. You are throwing away your wardrobe and buy new clothes because throughout the years you were buying too much stuff? Got it.
0,mann please give me some i have been a loyal fan
0,"I needed to hear this, thank you.... going to clean my Wardrobe right now"
0,Who bought the issey miyake jacket?! 😤
0,"i'm 6'3 200lbs, do you think your hooties will fit ?  i'm in the US and in need of a comfy hoodie"
0,"Whenever any fashion YouTubers I watch sell off their clothes or even give them away for free im sad because I’m just always bigger than them.  Like foot size I’m 11.5/12, I have really wide shoulders and I usually wear XL or XXL, shit is just unfair bruh"
1,"This video was great, Tim! I'm glad about your approach moving forward since I'm also shifting to a minimal lifestyle for a number of reasons."
1,I don’t think you’ve scored enough with fashion. You dress like Zara without shopping at Zara. I feel like you just touched the surface of fashion. In my opinion.
0,I want a video of your closet after the purge… the things you genuinely love and wear!
0,This is very normal just making room to evolve
0,"geez, looks good man, but am broke lol"
0,any chance of more discounts on stuff that didnt sell ?

0,Nothing
0,"It’s been such a joy watching your style journey over the last 6 years, Tim. Having said that, I’m pushing 40 and also at that point in my life where I’m saying yes to less. It’s liberating and also, in this age of mass consumption and fast fashion, it’s a statement to the world where you can be satisfied with having little."
0,"a mi me pasa con el gym que solo tengo 3 pantalones negros cortos, 3 remeras negras y unas Adidas blancas con medias Adidas blancas de caña alta, algunas veces uso unas de caña media-corta genéricas. Pero debería de hacer eso con todo mi armario"
0,"The real question is, what did you keep :)"
0,I need to lighten the load in my closet also. I have so much and wear so little of it. Like you I gravitate towards certain pieces and a  certain color.
0,"Went to Europe, missed video by 2 days and now it’s all sold out 😢"
0,bro i wish i had money to buy at least one of them xd
0,now we want to see the pieces you kept!

0,What's the password to open website
1,I feel this. I just cleaned out my closet! It’s a nice reset. It better aligns to pushing out new styles and pairings. ❤
0,I think clothes that get worn out based on one’s body and wearing habits is the true mark of personal style. Too many clothes in the wardrobe slow down this evolutionary process.

0,"In my country’s time, 9 pm, is 03 night 😭😭😭, I have school after that night😂😭. O well, guess I’ll “sacrifice some “sleep time”!"
0,I appreciatie this so much! Personally I started this in last year to and i must say its so enlighting to have less clutter in my wardrobe. Most of my pieces fit together now so its much more easy to style a fit. I take care of the clothes i love even more and appreciate them.
0,Good luck Tim. I'm 60 and I've tried this a few times. Good luck Tim.
2,Is it possible to request for a piece to be worn and unwashed bro? Will pay extra for it.
2,"Maybe it is just another stage of your fashion life, we change our taste in how we wear all the time, which is influenced by things around us ( sponsors, commerces, Idols, influencers, friends, trends, fashion houses, etc..), and possibly, you've already achieved a high status in fashion and life where all aspirations and demands are met that you no longer crave attention, showing or proving anything, anyway be young and passionate."
0,Real one 🎯💛
0,"Please stop making these videos as well as you are encouraging thousands and thousands (probably millions) of people to overconsume as well.

Now that you have reach and an audience please make videos of minimalism and sustainable ways of everything, including fashion and perhaps even food.

Peace Mate. <#"
1,where is the jacket from 2:53
1,Can you give me your other cloth
1,"Hey Tim, could you make a video on dressing with intention. I think a reason why wardrobes (like mine) are so big is because we have certain pieces for certain occasions. Going out to a bar vs festivals, cozy, cold, hot, travel, holidays and vacation, gym, work, weddings etc. I would love a video breaking down how you would navigate around something like that."
0,OH can I check this out? whats the password?
0,"I love this. We are similar in height so I always enjoyed your content to see how fashionable (in my eyes yours) fashion fit on a person like me. It was always about educational, minimalist in both the looks and now the lifestyle. Amazing and looking g forward to future content!"

3,"Recently took half the step of this and sorted all my clothes (clothes I only wear when going out / putting on a fit, clothes I wear casually at home but also could rock a fit with and clothes that I would never wear outside.

Really put into perspective how little of my clothes I actually like and wear."

4,Cleaning your wardrobe not only makes you feel so much better inside out but also makes you realise how little of what you have you use regularly.
1,Fair play man. Good luck on the new adventure ❤
1,will the items be able to be shipped internationally?
1,All you need is Uniqlo <3
1,"You've gotten rid of clothes 3 times (this being your third time...on video anyway....that I've managed to find on your channel). 

Do you feel you should just let clothes go by giving them out to viewers on your channel since you'll definitely get more clothes again after a while due to being a fashion channel."
0,It appears that renting a larger flat to have additional space to store clothes wasn't on the agenda.
1,Very good and respectful idea Tim  :)

0,"I have been considering what to keep now that I am retired. Living in the Midwest, USA we get all seasons. I have a cold weather closet and a warm weather closet. That is a great place to start a declutter for me. I use the term style, not fashion. I choose to improve and refine my style by choosing to wear the more elegant options in my wardrobe. Sure. Mistakes will be made aling the way. Developing a refined style is not effortless."

0,Really enjoyed this one. Important message and better for the environment!
0,"Yeah, I’ve recently stopped buying clothes to just focus on wearing and “destroying” all my old clothes."
1,Mr. Dessaint knowing your clothes are mostly from high end brands will you sell them affordably?
0,Less is more 👏🏼
0,"Thank you for this video, makes me realize.. Less is more"
3,"Buying clothes intentionally that you really like definitely pays of in the long term. 
I always take much more time than others in choosing a simplest clothing item. It can be a hassle or frustrating researching for that perfect piece, but it has been almost always worth it for me, I appreciate them every time I wear and makes me happy. 

Fewer and more quality items that feels YOU is the way."
1,Does anyone knows about the jacket at 02:48 ?? It fits my cup of tea 😮😮😮
0,"Yeah, you've gotten out of touch and only wear high fashion brands.

your style is the most basic and generic way to look good, it works but basic.

If you want to evolve your channel and content, i suggest you travel, go into cities and shop for what's equivalent to $100 worth of clothes, take inspiration from the culture, what the day to day citizens wear, then style it."

1,ID on jacket at 3:43 ? Are you selling it :0
1,Happy belated birthday!
5,"I've been a fan ever since you started your channel! Although I've now transitioned (literally) to more feminine/women's clothing, this sentiment is something that I'm seeing more of in the fashionsphere more and I'm here for it! I'm in the same journey of trying to be more intentional about what I bring in/out of my closet and what has helped me tons is digitally cataloging my wardrobe. Every time I have the itch to buy something, I look at my existing wardrobe and 9 times out of 10, I see that I have a similar piece which stops me from buying a new thing. I'm glad that we're all now at a point where we want to express ourselves more and be more thoughtful about how we live our lives."
8,"I'm just a regular dude but even MY closet is filled to the brim with so many random clothes, and sometimes I wear some of them just because I feel bad for neglecting them.  Makes me understand why ppl sell their clothing, cause I bet there are ppl out there who could give those pieces a better life than I did.  Might have to sell some soon ❤"
0,"I've been following you for quite long, fells about the same."

0,4:22 damn I really want that essentials polo shirt but the price killed me last time I check
0,Good video and I like that idea! Seems like a smart way to avoid overthinking about outfits and focus on some high quality styles. Besides that...I wonder why your flat looks like every other fashion youtubers flat. Aren't you bored by all the earth tones? Looks kind of souless to me :(
0,Yo good stuff man
0,Tim no SHOT you are 31 years old you're literally 25
0,Hey Tim! What sizes do you wear?
0,"Bro I’m pretty happy you made that decision, as the minimalist said “less is more”, plus, with a Uniqlo T shirt and some jeans you’re done 😅(just kidding)"
12,"I started minimizing my wardrobe just this January. My mindset was to keep the clothes that I feel I look good in. What I ended with was 2-week's worth of clothes, and I love it."
0,Gotta love sitting in chairs after a long day of tackling the laundry ❤
0,My entire room is full of clothing that I never wear. I think I'll be paying Goodwill a visit if I can't sell them soon.
0,that rick owens video is a true inspiration
0,I heard that merely made trekking shirt is garbage and really poor quality and poorly cropped dimensions (I secretly want that piece for myself lol)
3,"I'd love to see how/what pieces you chose to keep in a future video! and choosing to sell your pieces to an audience sure to appreciate and take real care of them is a wonderful (and more sustainable) idea, loved this vid"
0,"I wish selling clothes was as easy / common for guys as it is for women. For ""regular"" stuff. Ofc fashion brands get sold often"

Btw love from India 🇮🇳

I want to dress like you 
But there is no option in india 

Only little bit."
0,I love your style! I hope I can cop as many pieces on Sunday.
1,"Big fan of this move. Minimalism deserves a comeback imo. But not like how overdone it was a couple of years ago. I think it lacked personality. For example, my goal right now, would be to have most of my pieces fit together. So I don't have one pair of pants that only fit with one shirt. As if I could close my, pick something random, and have a good fit maybe 8/10 times."
0,I don’t wear Alexander McQueen; I wear what Alexander McQueen wears.
0,I've spent the past couple of years trimming pieces out of my wardrobe and trying to condense my clothing down to a regular capsule that I can rotate. It's honestly shocking how many pieces I have (and still have) that I've not worn for years
2,"Am someone way older than you and admittedly curated so much clothes over the years, I found it refreshing to watch your channel and other fashion content creators give me inspiration on the clothing I currently own. I know I have pieces that fit well into my life and just need new set of eyes to help me bring new life to the clothes I have. Looking forward to your journey and also this Sunday in hopes that I might acquire a “handful” of pieces to incorporate in very archival closet. Take Care! 😊👍🏼"

0,This video made me smile ☺️
2,"I recently watched your older video where you tidied up, using the konmari method. Tidying and removing things that you don't need or use really makes you feel better :)"
0,Minimalistic aint realistic.  MIDDLELISTIC is more reasonable.  That's better than Maximalist.
0,Love this… doing it myself lately
6,"Finally, educational content and analysis is what I want. How to think about clothes and less about recs. Excited for the new direction."
1,pretty sure Uniqlo Airism White Tee was on the list of things that you keep 😂
0,"im 31 this year and yes i have this phase too 😂 the differences is, hard to sell my used clothes 😂"
0,You and Brock McGoff taking different angles on reevaluating your relationships with fashion within a week of each other.
0,Love the vid man. Please can we get a tattoo update. Ur IG pics are🔥
0,"I have a huge wardrobe and way too many clothes and I will probably trim it down eventually buttt I do actually wear most of my clothing and rotate through things a lot. If I had Tim's issue of not wearing certain pieces at all or gravitating towards the same 20% always I'd def sell stuff right now. I think I do follow the 80/20 rule but actually wear 80% of my clothes, not 20."
179,"Heyyy Tim, I'm really enjoying the direction you're taking with your personal style . As someone just starting out, it’s tough not to be influenced by you and other creators. 
I’d love to see you launch a series where you guide your followers in building their wardrobes based on their personal style preferences, combined with your expertise. Maybe you could do it every month or every other month, i think it’d be sick!"
4,Quality over quantity at all stages!
0,Does any1 know what watch is that that Tim's wearing? It looks so distinct.
3,Loving the different shots where you speak to camera
11,"I have been gradually downsizing for a few years, went from over 100 pairs of shoes down to 30 my end goal is 5 pairs. I did it by wearing them out, selling, donating and not replacing them. I pretty much applied the same tactic to my clothes using a wardrobe app. It has made my life substantially better in many ways!"

4,"I love your content Tim, your videos always feels like a big brother advice
Thank you!"
0,"Love this, I’m in the in transition of wanting to do this myself. That being said being a rework/repurpose designer. Have you considered giving away your not so great condition clothes to a friend in a similar avenue as well? Just a thought, ultimately charity is the way I would go as well. But possibly even working with someone like myself to create 1/1 reworked pieces would be pretty cool as well. 🙇‍♂️"

0,1:36 I bought that jacket from you! 🙌
0,"I want a straight fit pleated pant, in India I searched everywhere but I couldn't get a hold on the right one, the the green coloured Asos one you have is the one I love and I like more of that fit, I honestly feel jealous when I see those type of pants on YouTube 😭"

2,"Turning 44 this year and yeah, convenience tops everything else. Do have my core pieces since a while and it works well. its a cool process and fun, so look forward to what comes next on your channel and how all works out for you. Cheers mate and a happy weekend."
0,"tim, i love your content but i wanna pushback. imagine a chef who only wants to cook his favorites; imagine a musician who only listens to his favorites. the chef and musician will likely stagnate. now you aren't a fashion designer (but a keen curator) but if anyone is going to have a large wardrobe and appreciate it, it's a fashion youtuber.

i can see maybe this is a move to simplify your life, to focus on having a family? or you're planning to move a different avenue of business? whatever the future holds, you should be proud of having a ton of clothes. i wouldn't trust an artist with only sketchbook"

27,"I have 3 pants, 3 hoodies, 5 T-shirts, 4 sweaters, 3 jackets, and one pair of boots. That's my wardrobe. I watch fashion influencers religously but tbh I've never bought anything from any of them, I just wait for sales at JCrew, where I get litterally all my clothing. I'll thrift more i a few years, but tbh I'm good with what I've got. I buy like 1-3 items a year, and only when something seems really good. That's part of the benefit of buying when things are cheap and with no returns. You'll wait 3 years before buying a pair of shoes, and you're gonna use that pair for the next 30 years. guarantee.
i would like to buy some jewlery tho... it's kinda sad how little I accessorize-- the good shit just always seems so expensive."

4,"The best grooming tip I can give anybody, and it's basic af, but will make a bigger difference than pretty much anything else you can do:
Wash your face, with a facial cleanser, morning and night.

You know what guys are like - we'll buy a moisturiser or some shit with a nice box, or because it's expensive, or because it was in a Daniel Simmons vlog.
But then when it comes to taking it off, we just splash some water on our face and call it done. Or we think that being in the shower for 5 mins was enough.

Seriously wash your face, twice a day. It'll make you skin better, you'll look younger, your eyebrows will be better condition and it just takes a minute."

8,"Would y’all agree that Ironing your clothes is one of an underrated grooming tips too? Or is it just me. As I’m from a tropical climate region, we still do hang our clothes under sun to dry (instead of using a dryer) and then iron our clothes. I find a crisply ironed shirt adds that extra zhuzh/zhoosh to styling, no? 👔"

1,"A grooming suggestion….



Too late for our presenter, unfortunately though. Don’t have so many disjointed tattoos….. it’s like a childlike graffiti artist has been at work on his arms. Blue splodges of ink that look out of place and unappealing.

Think long and hard before you put a logo on your body that will be there until the crematorium burns it off or the worms eat it up. “It’s my personality” shouts the owner. Then your personality needs to realise what message that conveys about you…

UNEMPLOYABLE…."

You might be showcasing autoimmune disorder symptoms. I had plenty of acne for many years up until 25, exhausting all ""common"" options.

Eventually I went onto the carnivore diet (meat, salt, water only) for my IBD, a very rough autoimmune disease, and as a bonus besides letting me get off my meds, it deleted my acne - which no other product could reliably do."

0,"If the first nutrition tip talked about allergies, food intolerances, and dietary diversity, I would agree with this point. 
But telling a large audience that uncontrolled studies with a small sample confirmed the effectiveness of Omega-3 (whose production and composition are not controlled because it's a dietary supplement, and is best absorbed through fish, NOT supplements, so it's a matter of diet, not pills and capsules) seems strange. The same goes for vitamin D - large-scale studies with large samples, randomized controlled studies show no effect from taking it, either on bones, wellbeing, or immunity (you can read info about history of this vitamin — it's so intresting and ambiguous)."

2,Actually more recent studies of Omega 3s had no affect or a reverse effect on the heart. Only special conditions right now should be considered for taking them. As for Vitamin D it's much easier to get sunlight and have that convert naturally as not all vitamin D supplements are made the same.

1,Well done bruv
0,"I call this split fashion! Like supreme? This kind of hyped up self important clothing brand? Will fade into obscurity!!

0,The Ralph Lauren influence is very apparent in the ALD stores.
3,"Tim...go deeper into your research.  The company was created by 3-4 young black boys from brooklyn.  Teddy relied on them for all of this influence and design culture(vulture) for the first 4 years, even giving them equity in the company. He paid them $400 a week, below minimum wage and in the form of free food from his family diner. Then he screwed them out of it when the corporate money came...if people knew the real origin story, no one would buy another item from them ever again."
1,Great video and thank you for introducing ALD never knew about them.

Are you looking for a professional thumbnail designer 
 I can provide you premium thumbnails at a very low price................."
1,Tim whats the name of your glasses?
11,"Agree with other comments. Feels that the ALD moment has passed, but their lookbooks and style is still amazing. And I love that they put so much effort in there brick and mortar stores. Never understood the price point though. It was always cheaper to buy Ralph, Wallees, Timbs and so on - who are still the originals - and never got the same quality with ALD."
0,No more drakes though
0,Dress like Mackelmore on a shoe-string made of gold budget. Should never pay designer prices to look like you raided a vintage store.

1,"Great video. I'm from Brazil and i had the opportunity to visit ALD in London last year and as you said it's a unique experience. You did a great analysis about how the brand works and it should be an inspiration for any person in probably any kind of business, not just in streetwear. Great editing, aesthetic. Your work is fire, congratulations bro."

1,Thanks
31,"I like the ALD for Drakes styling, but this used to just be what getting dressed was. Not to sound like an old person, but remember a time when individuals themselves did exactly what Teddy did in creating his brand, which was look not only to brands but to the various cultural, subcultural, and visual landscapes around them for influences and inspiration for their own personal style. Anyone with style took it upon themselves to shop for basketball jerseys or hoodies one day,  shop where the old dudes were shopping at the next day, and Barney’s (or whatever y’all kids got now) the day after that, and combined pieces as they saw fit. They did not wait for a designer to do it for them. I feel like so many brands are sort of just curating and styling more than presenting new designs, which is fine. But I just miss the days when people could do that for themselves. I enjoyed the video though."
0,This brand was heavily inspired by polo
0,"Nice brand, but the shitty customer service kills the cool out of it!"

0,yall try too hard
1,Great in depth video. Love their lookbooks
1,Even though I’ve only just recently got into ALD (admittedly due to the hype) I resonate with them a lot: I’ve always been stuck in between the streetwear and menswear sides of fashion and ALD strikes a brilliant balance.
2,"We dressed really well in the 90s in NYC. Teddy went to Catholic school, and we mixed prep with hood. Like Polo Teddy Bear Sweaters with khakis/jeans and Timbs."

0,"owned by LVMH, quality is declining"
0,"While i respect the effort and history behind ALD, i can't say their style works with my wardrobe. 
Never liked the Ralph Lauren look or style. I prefer something entirely else. 
Here in Norway we have saying that goes like: if you wear Ralp Lauren you're likely a daddy's boy. Meaning; you ask your dad for money for just about anything. 
You got the 90's middle part haircut or slicked it back. And you view yourself in a higher regard than usual. 
I realise this doesn't exactly paint a positive image of the Ralph Lauren brand 😅"
1,"I have some of their pieces. I like the brand and their aesthetics, but I find the quality subpar compared to the price point. 

IMO, Ralph Lauren is still the best (especially Purple Label)"
21,Look Mama I made it to a Tim Dessaint  video lol 8:36 🔥

1,"This is a really cool video Tim! Really interesting. ALD is such an interesting brand; I love preppy but I've never liked ALD's hype-wear take on it personally — the things I like by them are Ralph Lauren adjacent and I'd rather have RL in that case. However, I think what they've done is truly incredible, and their ability to tap into the cultural zeitgeist (the Porsche stuff is genius) as a new brand is enviable. They will be studied! I think they've got the potential to be the just as prestigious as RL if they keep this up. They offer something slightly different, tapping into the preppy with the current street culture, just like RL did back when! Teddy is a visionary for sure."
1,"Maybe, but I still despise drop culture."
0,A MILLION D'OR
0,"Bought a piece from them a few months ago, quality was absolute garbage. I came to find out they moved their production from Canada to Vietnam.."
1,Teddy was always talented but he was also always privileged. In this world it's more about who you know than what you know.
0,A great deal of the clothing is made in China 😔 If they manufactured in the US it would be waaay more interesting.
1,"This was a good and fun video. 

Keen for other brand spotlights if you do get the time Tim ❤️"
2,Bro check out dent de man!
2,"My man, this is 🐐 tier content!! Thank you"
1,"The styling is still great and while I own some pieces, it feels like now it takes too much effort to actually find pieces from them with decent material composition, plus the drops already make it super annoying to shop so I feel like I am quickly losing interest. You can often get similar enough pieces with better quality from other brands, especially if you are willing to curate not just from contemporary pieces but also archives."

2,"Tim, brother! I need the ID of your banger glasses to keep living a normal live!"
2,"Excellent video man, there are not enought vids about ALD on Youtube"
0,That’s a great hat you bought
4,"I really like this history content, Tim. Please keep it coming. I definitely appreciate the research, time, and effort."
1,Pure perfection!
3,Excellent documentation of the brand's history.
1,You nailed it with the storytelling on this Tim. This was very inspirational especially as a creative myself. 👌
0,Bro is forcing us to like this brand lol
0,i love how British ppl say “puma” lmao
0,I like this type of content
1,"Increíble video, saludos desde Chile 🇨🇱 tu estilo y expresión me inspiran a diario"
0,ALD fell off hard
1,I have two of their caps which I wear a lot. Love it.
2,Wish ALD was in LA
1,I'm like its styling. I don't feel the need to buy anything by ALD though.
1,Loved the video ! From a guy who is absolutly not in fashion
0,I see ppl complaining about their quality going downhill each year
1,"They started great, but their QC has declined unless it's their leather goods. The price increases are also ridiculous for the pieces made from polyester. Those prices shouldn't be unless they are natural fiber goods with excellent stitching and craftsmanship. Although I feel like they're getting greedy with the pricing, their style is certainly timeless and very NY."
2,As a New Yorker who is familiar with many brand as a former asst buyer. Aime’ reminds me of The BKCircus which has stores in Brooklyn and lower Manhattan esp the styling. I enjoy the video.  Drake and The BKCircus have filled this niche .
1,Never thought we’d see you in a Mets jersey! I thought you were against graphics? lol Looks great tho 👍🏽
3,"ALD constantly has lines and even though everyone has now started to replicate their lookbook style, they are evolving and showing growth. This video format was top notch. Have you seen SAAF GARMENTS yet?"
1,"I used to wear ALD at the start back in 2015-2016… Brand fell off, pieces used to be of high quality, they were scarce enough to not be as today this band wagon sort of brand… I still dig with the overall aesthetics but too many pieces and too many collections now… Hope they will one day become this rare breed again! 😅"
6,"@15:57 how can you attribute those styles to ALD (unless the influencers mention the brand)? The style itself is quite common even before ALD. Being in my 40's, the style actually similar to my office wear: mixing smart, formal, casual, street pieces. Maybe the kids are just gravitating to old people style. :) Though I'd check out the brand sooner or later as it does match my aesthetic. It's just not well known and accessible here in Asia."
0,Is he sponsored?
3,"I can get pieces of similar quality or better for less and I refuse to pay for branding. This is a brand that lives on the ""oh we are fancy"" vibes. Which has become the new wave of boutiques for clothes. It helps create an elitism and tribalism feeling in people which is why they style the shops the way they do."
4,"$900 hoodie, 900 dollar overshirt out of nylon...yeah I am not paying that. T-shirt for 130 dollars and so on."
4,Would love to see more videos like this. Drakes would be a great shout
1,Never seen mesh shorts like them before 😮
53,Just went to their flagship store in soho NYC last weekend and despite what a lot of people were saying the staff was overall friendly and the guy I talked to explained the history of the brand and what their aesthetic is inspired by
21,"Cafe Leon Dore and Plantshed Kith remind me of this one clothing store I visited in Norway called ""Les Deux"" and their physical store had a bunch of elevated streetwear pieces/a similar vibe.  They even had a higher-end espresso machine at the store and sofas so customers could make their own drinks if they knew how and chill.  Literally felt like being in someone's house like you said it was dope 🔥"
1,"Anybody that knows the pants at 13:01?
Love this type of video exposé by the way Tim. Truly very well done."
7,"Hey Tim and thanks for your video.I was hoping a style related YT channel would make a video about the history of ALD and what is the whole world behind the brand. As a Greek and an enthusiast about the American culture,without a doubt ALD is definitely my favorite brand not only because of the simplicity that the brand represents but also the elegance that most of the clothes have. In my opinion it is definitely a brand that would be timeless just like Ralph Lauren."
0,All the violent loudness none the classic staying power.
14,I love ald. Ever since the first NB collab I’ve been buying pieces
5,"Hey look, it’s me in the video!!"
1,"This was a good breakdown of their origins and keys to their success , I know it must have taken a lot of time in researching. More of these please. I love  learning about business of fashion even though I know this might not be your niche."
0,I wish normal people could afford it
1,very cool how you went in depth and talked about it
1,I live around the corner from the London shop. I’ve been in there so many times and I promise I had no idea how prestigious this shop was. They do a good coffee though. Thanks for the education.
1,"Lmaooo ald fell off two years ago, this is like making a bode video"
1,Great job with this video! 😎👍
95,The moment you find yourself queuing up for clothing you know you already fucked up the basics
0,"Love this video style! BUT where are people finding the niche brands that make quality pieces, that aren’t hyped and are reliable staples? I have been loving Universal Works lately but I need more inspo! Community help a brutha out!"
3,I dont like ALD too much. Their branded pieces are too showy and their unbranded basics seem too generic. For that type of vibe I prefer Kith.
1,"You sold me on their story, I'll have to check em out, nice video!"
1,I love the Leon chicken rice hotbox
1,If you want to look like mid 20s black trapper yes it is a best choice :)))))
2,"Theirs stuff looks like heavy influenced from stuff from the second hand drift stores that people buy and put together in the city.  Not a bad concept since all the items are new and classics. has that ""Vintage"" look and feel."
5,"idk i totally disagree
for what they offer they're completely overpriced
there are so many brands that offer a similar vibe at better price points"
1,"This brand is very cool, but I am starting to dislike all the hype beast cop’n. That just comes with it I guess. Just means when been on to something since the beginning 🤷🏽‍♂️"
2,"So, 15 minutes of ad? No, thanks"
1,"Most of my ALD are made in China though… for their price point, they could manufacture their products in Europe or North America…"
1,"I feel so uncultured, I’ve never heard of this brand before"
0,Never heard of this - canada
0,"LVMH? Eh, nevermind."
16,"Incredible content my dude, ALD's influence in undeniable! Their look books really are immaculate, whenever I'm stuck for ideas I can always find inspiration in some form from their styling!"
1,ALD YYDS!
11,amazing video. ALD is my fav brand currently. thanks for dropping this heat.
12,"I have two pieces of ALD. A sweater, and a cardigan. Both have a trendy cut and drape but are made with classic materials making them feel sophisticated and premium. I think to me, that’s what the brand does so well. I stay away from the louder branded pieces and go for more of the “quiet luxury” side of ALD which speaks to what you are saying how they kinda make something for everyone. Great video!!"
0,Tattoo update please
1,Very good on ALD. The one I’ll recommend to watch to understand the brand. You’ve talked about every aspect of the brand in details. Also the video is very professional as always. Congrats !!
0,"i meannnn, some ALD pieces are nice. But it doesn’t warrant the prices they ask for their products. same as for any luxury brand.

but if you buy from the brand and it makes you happier, then why not? ultimately it’s very based on your own perceived value on the product. And if you rate ALD products highly, then i guess it’s not a bad buy"

59,"love the direction your vids are heading in Tim, the editing is great"

0,"Thanks for this vid! Great info and good rules to follow! Lately I´m struggling with dressing for work, on one side I love experimenting with clothes but on the other side I want to look professional. Most of my coworkers are (still) wearing skinny jeans, blue shirts and sneakers or leather shoes. This gives me the feeling I have to tone it down to be taken more seriously. How would you approach this problem and how would you dress business casual?"

1. To never have more than 3 colors and 1 of them at least a base color (I prefer two base colors). 
2. Dress what makes you feel good and self-secure
 3. Keep your clothes clean and tidy, use a lint roller and fabric shaver.
 Will get you far. I don't care if someone overdresses. I would think it's pretty fun if someone came overdressed to a bbq hehe"
