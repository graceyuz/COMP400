Yeah, his hometown might have known, but the rest of the world wouldn't have. Unless his wife made a massive deal about it, but I doubt he would have lost his job if it didn't go viral. Lost his wife, likely because SOMEONE would have recognized him. But the job wouldn't care if there was no backlash. CEOs get away with shit like this all the time"

0,I’m sorry the way my jaw dropped when they said her brother called her back acne “DISEASED SKIN” is absolutely vile. Acne is a completely normal thing and for her own brother to say that is such an indication of his character. I think she isn’t the asshole. I think if someone says no then move on and ask someone else but to completely BASH them is inhumane behavior.

0,"So - Love Island:
My husband works as a personal trainer at a gym, and most of the people he works with are kids (like early 20s), and they LOVE Love Island. So much that they kept telling him he needs to watch it. We would see ads for it all the time and every time we'd be like ""ugh, what a dumb show. I couldn't be bothered by this show"", and that was our stance for a solid month. Then one day, he comes home and says ""So I might watch Love Island on my own?"" And I was like "".....would you wanna watch it together? I'm curious now"" 

all that to say, we watch Love Island now, unironically, and we're invested lmao! 

but tbh, we've only watched one season, and I probably won't watch anymore because like you said, it's kind of shallow entertainment, and it also emphasizes the cis-het relationship, and there is no room for anything else. I would find it more interesting if it wasn't like, boys v girls. But still, after watching episode after episode of people making out and doing weird sexual challenges, I get a little bored."

0,I've understand every word you said about labubus... i need to find a job assap
0,Twas a battle for some Alberta tickets but we going!!!!!!
0,"41:02 I feel like ESH would’ve been a more accurate verdict. Like “diseased skin” her brother should get an AH verdict just for that comment. Also, Kurtis didn’t read it but the brother says “…to ask someone who's not in Healthcare to touch diseased skin” a person doesn’t need to be in healthcare to touch acne. Should OP have asked her mom or used spray sunscreen? Yeah maybe, but I wouldn’t say they’re an asshole for it. Kurtis also assumed her case of backne was as bad as his, which may or may not have been the case. I had backne in high school and it was significantly less of an issue to manage for me, just red bumps on my skin that popped occasionally. Nothing like what he described. 

But redditors don’t like nuance so I’m not surprised it was YTA

ETA: found the post via Google, most of the YTA is soft YTA, which makes more sense"

0,"40:10 - as a current haver of bacne I still want to be able to enjoy myself on the beach and not get sunburnt, however I would never ask anyone to touch my back especially someone I don't know well. Op should have asked their mum as a closer relative, or do what I do and used a spray on sunscreen that doesn't need someone else to rub it in. I think ops brother is wrong for calling her skin ""diseased"" as its often just a hormonal issue or a reaction to shower products once you're past your teens, not a disease that will infect SIL. I think ops brother has a part to play in this situation happening in the first place as he could have stepped in when SIL said yes and asked her if she's sure, knowing her history of social anxiety, at which point the mother could have stepped up to apply the sunscreen or something and the whole situation could have been avoided. I think OP shouldn't assume that what's convenient for her is what's convenient or good for others"
0,kurtis how do you not know what blind boxes are 💔
0,PLEASE START STREAMING AGAIN
2,"For the shitting AITA: There actually are conditions where you can be in the bathroom for hours.

I used to have one! Ulcerative Colitis! I got it when I was 13/14 and I would be in the bathroom almost constantly shitting blood. Had to wear adult diapers, had no ability to control bowels, and to be honest that sounds like what the BIL probably has. I ended up getting my entire colon + rectum removed when I was 18. Turns out having such a heavily damaged colon has high risk of developing cancer! 

I still think that OP isnt the asshole though. When my colitis wasn't in remission, I couldnt even leave the damn house. I had to get homebound tutorting. I would NOT travel if my colitis wasn't in remission. But I also dont think the brother in law is the asshole. At one point me and my mom and my brother lived in a one bathroom apartment bcuz its all we could afford. I held that bathroom hostage so much that it developed stockholm syndrome. But that was also like.....our bathroom. Not someone else's.

The few times I did travel (NYCC specifically) I made note of every bathroom nearby. I still remember the locations of many of the bathrooms in the Jatvis Center.

Just some insight. I can get why the Sisters reaction would be saying ableism, though it wasnt, Ulercative Colitis really is just that bad.

Dont think Kurtis will end up seeing this but just some info for people who may be wondering how someone could be in the bathroom that long! Answer: Shitting blood."

I have ocd and I think very differently than others, I hate doing it and I have gotten in fights with all my family members about it. I cannot do it quickly because my body feels different and the 1 hour more that I would have stayed in the bathroom after someone told me, is considered a short time compared to if thye had not told me to get out.

A bit trippy too, and because it is a non linear topic, that’s probably why it’s performing “ worse “ even though you shouldn’t worry about that. You got people who love you even if they disagree a lot with you ( like me )"

0,I actually prefer when you're not in the studio.. it feels more genuine in the room you're in now
1,The time machine video was genuinely life changing it's like my new favorite kurtis video (other than watertok of course 🤗)
54,It’s lowkey crazy tho in the backne one that the brother blamed her for making the sil uncomfortable when she didn’t know she was uncomfortable? Like I know the brother was sticking up for his wife but like saying she was wrong for even asking is just unreasonable
0,He should live stream his podcasts
0,screamed out loud when you said you might start streaming again would die for that
42,"i loved your time machine video! in my opinion it was very creative and original, your thoughts on 'keeping the box closed' really touched me. 💐"

1,"""Love Island sucks"" solidarity!!!!"
2,"Welp, call me an asshole, but I don’t think calling your friend out on being conceded makes you an asshole. OP didn’t call her ugly, either, she just said she was average. That isn’t an insult (coming from someone who knows they’re average lol)."

0,37:49 ATTACK ON TITAN MENTIONED !
79,"The reddit story about back acne had really weird vibes to it, I understand it's weird for her to ask when she has terrible back acne. But she is not a mind reader and can't know when SIL wants to say no, that's on her to say that. And for the brother to call his own sister's skin diseased just because of acne.... Weiirddd... I just think that everyone was kind of the asshole here but they're putting all the blame on OP. She has a right to protect her back from UV as well y'all."
1,Title looks like the lyrics to Fairly Oddparents
2,Love the new Obtuse rubber goose green mouse guava juice video Mr mayor
0,The title itself is a work of 21st century art.

0,I’m so bored at work LETS GOOOOO
0,i got the one and only 24k kurtis conner
2,I had just finished making lunch when you started talking about using the pus at sunscreen. Thanks 🥰
656,"""I dont do anything crazy or exciting"" kurt you literally bought and used a time machine"
20,i believe i’ve summoned something in my home just from reading this title
103,23:50 this sounds exactly like the kinda rant i go on every time a piece of technology does not work the way it was intended to work 😭😭
0,haha kurtis said he's getting the itch
0,Omg thank you about Love Island. It is so unbelievably boring to me and just pure brain rot
1,the title gave me a jumpscare when the notification popped up on my screen

1,the way i just knew u were gonna talk about this
10,"The new vid was so fun tho, I like the deepdive on timetravel"
2,You missed the tik tok where she said her 24k gold labubu got stolen. Maybe the whole story is fake but it was fun to watch

1,the title is giving me a stroke 😭also js relized ive been watching for like a year and havent been subscribed.. cuz i thought i was this WHOLE FREAKING TIME
16,Kurtis I had a dream where you were a typical country boy and you and Jenna had a ton of kids and you let me stay at your house cus I was going to your show in America but had no where to stay and u gave me a basket of merch and one was a 4 inch tall triangle pillow that had Kurtis Conner embroidered on the bottom very small

0,a lil early to this one and I thought it was a fake video until I saw the acc😰
0,am I upset that this 30 year old man is more knowledgeable about the meme culture of people my age than I am? maybe. just maybe.
33,I feel like reading the title aged me forty years
9,Love Island (the British version) used to be great but the last few years it seems to have lost the spark. The thing I like about it is seeing how people handle different situations and learning what to do/ what not to do
2,if only u didn’t wear that damn hat
0,Omg im so happy he's talking abt the 24k labubu
41,I think I died and came back to life after reading that title
2,23:44 you sound like my father
2,Kurtis you should come out with a labubu and sell mini accessories…Like the hat incident…
2,Kurtis you remind me of a labubu

5,Hey Kurtis I’m doing pretty good how are you
1,Early!
534,Go back there! Get in your little room! Back! Back I say!

0,"NOOOO when straight men say period it’s sooo good, it’s like a rare commodity bc straight men don’t say it usually so it’s hilarious. keep saying period king"
0,I agree with you on ai but I do use it for school and it really does help a lot with learning and studying. It’s one of those things that are a huge resource but humans abuse it and it kills their brain cells.
0,"6:39 beep boop beep, start digging in yo butt twin"
0,it’s not clocking to you that i’m standing on business
0,14:13 this claim is insane because the ai will in fact take inspiration from every single youtuber ever when you do not specify a specific one. It is so clear that he has actually no idea what he is babbling about
0,Kurtis instead of a kindle you could also get the Libby app which is the same thing as the kindle but instead of paying for books you use your library card!!
0,The T shirt guy is so corny ngl
1,I feel like this whole thing is just gay men thinking that they are incapable of making women uncomfortable…. Like they are still men at the end of the day and we will be nice to you in public to avoid confrontation.
0,I use chat gpt for school sometimes but not to have it actually do any of the work- I have ADHD so I’ll put in my assignments and ask it to give me kind of an outline/steps for which to do first and what info I need to collect. It also works well for finding sources since google is fucking cooked. I never use it to write or take its word but idk that stuff can be helpful. I know how to do that stuff but it causes me a lot of distress tbh so it’s just helpful for organizing.
0,get your kindle king i finally caved and i read a whole trilogy in like a week that shit is so nice
1,"mm yknow his friend might’ve outted them revealing that she said no firmly to a picture in the bar,, but then they went on to film her. “she could’ve said no again!!” idk it sounds like you didn’t rly think about consent. i’m not a doja fan, i don’t rly like her, but i did find that odd."
0,"doja was definitely uncomfy in the video and playing along but she was out of line with that tweet of hers. Even when men make me feel uncomfortable but i play along because clearly they aren't doing it maliciously, i don't talk shit about them on the internet like the fuck"
0,"If Doja Cat said that she wanted a shirt (and actually DID want one), then I’d assume she meant she’d want a new shirt and not the one he’s wearing. 

Honestly I’d call it a musty ass shirt too, like as a woman I wouldn’t want to be given a random ass guys shirt and be expected to want his shirt… especially because he’s BEEN WEARING IT and he’s definitely got his bodily fluids on it (because it’s natural but still..)"
0,I will say I’ve had drunken interactions like the doja cat situation at bars. Nobody has given me their shirt lol. And I’m not famous so I’m sure I’m not as leery as a celebrity would be. But if I felt it went too far I’d get out of the situation and not think another thing about it.
1,Nothing Mr Beast can do that would surprise me. He’s creepy
0,As a college student every time I submit a paper I have to fill out a form showing all the ways that I used AI. I really don’t use it though.
0,Thanks for talking about ai though its prevalence is REALLY starting to bug me google doesnt even show its usual search results anymore 99% of the time
1,"i agree with everyone in the comments but the second guy , the one that called Doja a bitch for saying no? 😭 if being gay gives you that much entitlement to insult women I think a self reflection is needed ."
0,"kurt owes us nothing but asking what time we are at feels like a therapist saying we've run out of time in the middle of the most traumatic thing that's ever happened to you 😭😭😭 i love ur content n dont want it to end, ur awesome :)"
1,"Saw an ad before this saying ""talk to character AI"". This shit is getting out of hand, like you said, not everything needs to be AI."
0,is it just me or did mr beast sound drunk
0,28:14 Kurtis can't focus because this guy looks like his secret love child with Hasan. 🤫
1,19:45 incredible. You could literally do this with no computer.  Mr. Beast would go crazy over a 2nd grade collage
2,"Talking about the AI shit; ive noticed the newer generation lacks problem solving skills and common sense because their phone does all the thinking for them (I also feel like a fucking boomer talking like this) I think AI can be a helpful tool but I think people will become too dependant on it and its, in my opinion, the death of creativity"
0,I enjoyed listening 7:58 at this part :) happy to hear you!
0,"i am a student who doesn’t use chatgpt. Half the people in my school/grade (i think) don’t. The other half is becoming brain dead and i won’t apologize for it. teachers typically catch them using ai but don’t genuinely care because they don’t think it will matter in the grand scheme of things. they seem to genuinely not care if it’s morally wrong. a lot of them even attempted to use chatgpt for FINANCIAL LITERACY. im getting concerned because everywhere i look at this point, ai is in my face even though it has no reason to."
0,Just wanted to be the 666th comment ily Kurtis🖤
0,"Just graduated from art school and one of the things that sucked most was that we weren’t allowed to work digitally because our art teachers were afraid we’d use ai. Like bro. We CHOSE to be in art school and we LIKE making art were the last people who’d think to use ai. So ai just ruined everything because we weren’t able to work digitally, we had to work analogue (which means just not digitally). And that sucked because that mean we had to go out and use our own money on supplies for a project we had to do. 

TDLR: The fear of people using Ai takes away from artists being able to create digitally in art school"
0,This is the least interesting podcast I've ever heard
0,20:18 the funniest part about that stupid F1 to minivan switch out is that the picture still says check out this F1 with an arrow pointing to the minivan. I dunno if that’s supposed to be a joke or something but…
0,She was “pretending” to be rude to fans on twitter and then released her song Paint the Town Red. She said it was to make the vibe or something🤣 No one would call her an a$$hole if they weren’t already. Shes low-key tiring
0,"i go to an art uni and one of my classes had us use ai to generate like half the asignment, it took everyone like a million tries to get it to generate a good picture, idk if it was the intention but it made us all hate ai even more"
0,is jimmy not ai in the ad?
0,Petition to bring back the 🎶Very Really Good Podcast 🎶 theme song. That shit was catchy as hell
0,"35:42 ""Im sorry if I did anything wrong"" hey so what you really should be saying is ""im sorry doja that I made you uncomfortable"" 😭 bro also said ""im sorry if I was too nice"" Okay so he's just being passive aggressive atp bc he isn't actually apologizing; he saw nothing wrong. Doesn't matter what his intentions were, he accidentally made her uncomfortable. She also could've approached calling him out better but yk"
0,Took a shot everytime kurt said um and im feelin pretty glonky
0,Kurtis can’t think of someone with a stage name after talking about Mr Beast
0,"i get the kiss on the face was a lot but she was literally jumping up down with him and wrapped her leg around him too, going at him and calling him musty after was weird as hell and i don’t get why y’all are still on her dick when she literally dated a nazi and has had several weird ass mean interactions with people and was in raceplay chats 💀 obviously the guy is weird and wrong too but doja sucks"
2,I dont know who needs to listen to this but it is not because you are gay that you CANT make a woman uncomfortable...Seems pretty obvious (and I am a straight man btw)
0,Elton Hercules John's real name is Reginald Kenneth Dwight.
1,my mum had a baby book from when i was kid and her other name options for me with either Monica or Rachel — and i was born before Friends existed
1,doja cat is a nazi white supremacist sympathiser who likes to be reactionary because bad publicity still means folk are talking about u. not saying the guy went the right way about everything but im definitely not leaning towards her defense even though shes to be believed.
1,It seems a lot of people want to “be YouTubers” without actually wanting to do the making videos part
0,"A person can be mad at Doja for a lot of things, but this one aint it."
0,Kurt is my only and fully unbiased source of information for internet drama
1,On the topic of using AI in school; I am *_SO. FUCKING. GRATEFUL._* that I graduated just before AI influenced students and teachers now have to look out for what is and isn't generated. SO grateful I missed that FUCK
4,"as a cinephile, your perspective towards movies makes me so happy. ALL movies are special and every one of them should be appreciated for something. i mean it’s something a lot of people worked hard at, its good to have that outlook"
0,moccasins are sweet
1,"There are a LOT of of authors on TikTok who are admitting they’re using AI to write their books. Including for things like editing (obviously grammar and spelling check is different). BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF BEING AN ARTIST IF YOU HATE THE PROCESS OF MAKING ART??? 

And I see way too many people say “there is so much fear mongering and misinformation about AI” to defend its use. Like bro??? All the evidence points to AI being a harmful tool to make billionaires more money. What more reason do you need to not support AI??"
0,"""You better be the joker"" 💀"
0,Sorry to quote Taylor swift here LMAOOOO
0,KURTIS ILY! YOU'RE SO COOL & GENUINE! I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VIDEOS ALL THE TIME AND YOU NEVER FAIL TO MAKE ME LAUGH!!!
0,just got tickets for your show in November! so excited to see you live!
0,"about AI, since you asked for my opinion here’s my chance to rant about it: this shit is going TOO FAR and too fast, AI art makes me want to smash my phone it’s literally so off putting. sure AI is a tool and even I use deepseek to help me with boring tasks like responding to emails on my shitty ass corporate job (if companies want machines working that’s what they’ll get ig lmao) and you could argue that’s not really a great thing to do, however i think its WAY more problematic when you take it to art, like music, video, photography, all of that, because at that point and like you said: what is the point of art itself? it sucks the life out of it, it’s depressing and it’s CURSED. enooooouuuuggghhhhh"
1,I have been in situations where i remain polite in the moment and later actually decompress what happened and how i feel about it.
1,Mick Jagger shirt so tuff
2,very relieved to see the comment section using the common sense take about the Doja situation. It was so obvious that he was ALL UP ON HER in the video.
0,1:30 AAUUUUGHGHGHG I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU WOULD'VE HAD MY DEADNAME
2,Being the “punching bag” lol in that vid he was the touchy one💀 when does the bag do the hitting
0,Man drop more videos on your main channel PLEASE
4,"I so agree Kurtis, I feel like as a girl I could see Doja flinch at the hug and feel overwhelmed... it's always overstimulating I'm sure even more so for a famous person. She should have just said something like ""this kid was a sweety, in the future I prefer fans don't hug me it can be overwhelming but love ya"" or whatever. She didnt need to do that to him his video after was heartbreaking. He could also be bi but I genuinely didn't get that the harm was intentional even if we need to be careful about touching people depending on the culture and context. Doja seems stuck up and traumatized. I love her but that was truely mean. Poor things both of them.  [update] he's milking this he's going too far hes her stalker she was right"
0,"Mr Beast is not a good person, he allows abusers and r🍇pists to work for him and also treats his employees terribly, he also has no HR?? I implore everyone to look into it, an ex employee completely outed him and the toxic work environment. All he cares about is money and all the charity work he does is for clout so he can make more money, nothing he does comes from good intentions."
1,gay guys being blind to their own ability to oppress women is so real btw. I've been inappropriately touched by a few gay men especially when I was younger... just because there may not have been any sexual intent there doesn't make it okay. they were so confident handling me and couldn't imagine themselves oppressing me so much so that they didn't even realise how overtly uncomfortable I was :/
1,"I feel like you absolutely cannot go up to celebrities and kiss and hold them, especially women. That’s just not acceptable as a baseline"
1,Saying in my villain era gives I am dark gothic maga
0,40:14 ME
0,"i think not knowing a celebrity's name is ok cause they have a stage name for a reason lol and to expect everyone to know your name feels like entitlement. this situation was crazy to me because in the video there are no signs and no words that would express her disgust. there are ways to be polite but still establish the boundaries and in the video she seemed really encouraging. also, she could have handled it with him in private if it did disturb her so much. instead she decided to use her huge fan base to embarrass this guy... like there are appropriate ways to handle things"
0,I’ve watched this podcast for so long I can now predict which sound effect kurtis will use from the sound board
2,"Doja is not a great person 😂 this shouldn’t be surprising at this point. Nobody is saying she needed to feel comfortable or say this or that, but the fact that she’s always so ready to send her millions of fans after her other FANS is insane to me. She really doesn’t deserve the fame she has if all she’s going to do is constantly attack her fans. She’s a weirdo 🤷🏽‍♀️"
0,kurtis when your nose is stuffy you sound like my uncle
1,"I am so sick of gay men thinking they’re allowed to treat women however they want bc they’re gay. You’re still men, you’re still a stranger, it’s so creepy."
1,"I also HATE the argument ""she looked fine and nice"" like as if she had been honest and put boundaries he would have listened lol we all know what happens when women actually say what they think and put boundaries, just look the nasty things people say about Chappells responses with papparazzi.
basically if women are nice = you shouldve said something earlier, its your fault it happened
if women put boundaries = shes such a rude bitch, and in a celeb situation, she treats her fans bad 
like can we honestly ever win guys"
1,"honestly Im with Doja on that one, gay men are always touching women (happens a lot to me) without consent and think its fine just because its not sexual (like he said, hes a gay men, like that justifies it, what??). and when youre in the moment you dont want to be a bitch and ruin it but it does feel awful to feel like you have no power on who touches you, so i get her lashing out later when you realize how uncomfortable you felt. 
this also relates to the insane parasocial fan culture that we have where fans think they can do anything because theyre a fan and love them, but lets all remember we dont know them please, thats literally a stranger, dont treat them like you would a close friend. and I think the guy shouldve just apologized instead of making excuses and shading her, I did not get him saying ""I feel like Im always the punching bag"" like im sorry is she your bully??? didnt you just meet her??? what do you mean always broo"

0,"AI is like one of the most frustrating developments in the academic world, especially for students who deliberately choose not to rely on it. To me, using AI for my education feels like opting for a shortcut that risks bypassing the struggle through which real learning and intellectual growth happen.
What makes this even more frustrating is watching fellow students use AI-generated content to produce assignments that earn them higher grades than those of us who pour our time, energy, balls, sweat, and often our mental well-being into creating something original. There’s a deep unfairness in a system that seems to reward automation over authenticity, ESPECIALLY when the stakes are so high since we’re supposed to become more competent in the field we’re studying?! Like, imagine having a kid at ur hospital bed that earned a lot of their academic validation through the use of AI"

Beig gay does not give you a free pass to be a creep."

1,"With the Doja situation I don’t think she did anything wrong. I’m gay myself and have noticed over the years a certain kind of gay guy thinks it’s cool to be touchy with every girl they meet. A lot of it in my opinion is performative token gay BF to denote a sense of closeness between gay guy and girl friendships. Sometimes it’s even kind of a social status thing like I’m so fierce all women automatically love me. I think it’s fine obviously if you’re actually close to the person and they are cool with it, but in this instance I think the clout chasing and money making aspect made that fake AF impromptu filmed ad for his lame clothing line that he proceeded to use her as a prop for extra not cool."

1,"You shot your shot Kurtis, but it didn't work out. I'm kind of with Doja cat on this, even though she was being polite (offline), it was a little inappropriate of you to give her one of your old shirts. You have plenty of new merch you could have sent her that would have been new and clean.

1,Yeah i think he did it on purpose actually now for attention..
1,That guy is a celebrity stalker mind you
1,"NGL i would wear the ""musty ass shirt"" shirt 😂"
2,His best friend is very off lmfao
1,I hope that he and anyone who else who sees this interaction will now know not to touch strangers without permission. No one in the history of ever have liked being touched by strangers 😂
2,Its so obvious she's uncomfortable. I don't think I could touch any stranger celebrity or not like that and I would never want anyone to do that to me. All he had to do was apologize. Anyone is allowed to be uncomfortable at any point in time period. 😂 Also being gay is irrelevant. I'm not gay but I don't want random women touching me either and I've met gay men that have slept with women even after coming out. Saying you're gay means absolutely nothing
13,"Not wanting to make someone uncomfortable (intention) doesn't mean you won't make someone uncomfortable. Your intentions don't matter when the other person tells you they feel uncomfortable. If they felt some sort of way, it's valid. The fact that he said ""I'm gay, I didn't want to make her uncomfortable"" truly shows that even if he isn't ""straight"" he's still a man: He doesn't get that women who feel uncomfortable around men on the street don't feel this way bc we assume that they're straight, we feel that way bc WE DON'T KNOW THEM. When I'm out with my gay best friend (a man), I don't feel uncomfortable, not bc he's gay, but bc I KNOW HIM. HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. I know he wouldn't do anything to me bc he respects me. Same with my other guy friends who are straight.

It doesn't clock to the T-shirt guy that Doja felt uncomfortable bc he's a man, not bc of his sexual orientation. I can understand that her comment about the ""musty t-shirt"" was a bit rude, but everything else was valid. The way he kept trying to justify himself by saying ""she looked fine, she seemed nice and ok"" just shows his ignorance about the struggles women face and the behaviour we have to put on so that we can escape from situations safe."

1,"I'm doing my masters thesis right now and every student has to sign an agreement for how much AI can be used in their thesis (goes from zero to using it for creative writing or programming code). Our Uni also has special programs that detect AI in anything u turn in, no matter if its essays, presentations, etc.
A lot of students use it excessively, which I find very scary. Not only because it replaces actually doing the work urself and getting smarter as a result, but also becausse of the huge environmental impact it has. Can't even imagine what its like for people who are still in school"
1,"To the Doja Cat situation: As a woman I was watching the video and thinking they must know each other or something cause he was so touchy, then she tried to pull her wrists away and he just yanked them back and I knew they didn't and she must've felt so uncomfortable. Him being gay doesn't change anything, he's still a man she doesn't know."

0,"I'm sure he didn't mean to make her uncomfortable, but he did, so."
1,"AI existing within the humanities is just so antithetical to me.  I can see and understand its use within STEM related fields (though, even then I'd be incredibly skeptical of any inherited biases it may have been trained on) but in my opinion there is virtually no reason whatsoever for AI to be implemented or encouraged within spaces that, at their core, value art and fundamentally require the unique and varied examination/understanding of our own species.  The whole concept is just so... anti-human to me.  Soulless. I also find it intellectually lazy.  Just like physical inactivity can result in your muscles atrophying, not challenging and utilizing your brain (flexing your 'creative juices' even) will lead to cognitive decline - and then you need to ask yourself: who does that really serve?  Who benefits from your deteriorating ability to think for yourself and engage with things critically?  

We're currently navigating a period in our history where anti-intellectualism is on the rise and AI is only accelerating that by offering what it claims is an 'accessible' option that actively encourages users to disengage with analysis, logical principles, and problem solving (side note: the coopting of the language surrounding 'accessibility' here, as if AI is some great equalizer, is another thing we need to address - it's incredibly disingenuous).  When anti-intellectualism abounds, people will prefer reductive, black and white thinking over acknowledging and considering the very gray nuance that actually inhabits our world.  They feel compelled to choose the self-centered 'I only worry about me and what I want' approach over the empathetic 'let me consider the life and challenges this other person has led and how we can make a better world for all us' one (ie. the individual over the collective).  Purity culture becomes preferred because it can be rigidly defined with arbitrary gatekeeping whereas a more complex exploration of social cues regarding concepts like gender and sexuality requires us to contend with the fact these ideas and how we determine them are naturally fluid and ever-evolving.  

AI also removes many of the steps crucial to creation.  It feels so weird to even have to say it, but idea generation should emerge from YOUR ideas or in collaboration with others.  Not all of those ideas will be winners (they might all be flops, in fact), but delineating and evaluating the pros/cons to each is an important exercise that improves your skills as you engage in the important activity of problem solving.  Failing is also GOOD.  Failing is how we learn.  Creating ugly things is actually beautiful, in essence, because the act of creation and the act of improving yourself is an inherently ugly but beautiful experience that unites all of us as a species.  AI strips us of diversity; it strips us of challenging thoughts and discussions, our ideas become duller, less revolutionary.  And, ironically, as we decline... AI will too.  AI largely relies on human input (this is how it is trained) and if the humans stop inputting new work for it to learn from or worse only contribute dumbed down slop that was already generated by the AI itself, what do you think the longterm output will become? 

And all of this is not even bringing up the lack of ethics and untold harm to human life AI's existence heralds.  It is so amazingly wasteful in terms of resources and its environmental impact, especially when we consider what it produces and the lack of longterm societal 'value'.  Who the hell wants to click on a goofy looking AI thumbnail?  Who wants to spend their time reading something written by a computer with no distinct voice or unique frame of reference?  Who wants all of human history to be dumbed down and decontextualized into a tiny AI summary that lacks first-hand accounts, the evolution of analysis over time, and critical perspectives?  How does any of that aid humanity beyond producing something so sanitized/curated and devoid of unique thought that it's only real purpose is that it can be more easily marketed and sold to the masses?  Why are we still so tied to this idea everything must be curtailed to generate the most wealth possible or it holds no value? If we MUST make this argument, then why aren't we ALSO discussing how little many of us want to engage with this slop?  AI has absolutely had an impact on my content viewing habits and engagement online - I literally go online less because of it.  I don't want to click on an AI image or thumbnail, I don't want to read your dumb AI-generated 'social commentary' comic, I don't want to bother with your AI generated cover letter/email response because you (seemingly) can't be bothered to give me your actual time and thoughts, etc.  THIS is what we are accelerating the collapse of our planet's ecosystems for??

They can never stop me from rejecting AI and making art for myself, art others may never see but is by my own hand and made for my enjoyment.  It can never stop me from having thoughts and a writing voice that a bot and algorithm will never be able to completely predict as I am a dynamic human being who is constantly changing my perspective and growing as a person throughout the course of my life with each and every new experience and lesson learned...  And, yeah, the elitist in me (lol, hey, we all have flaws) absolutely looks down on and judges people who use AI... I really do think it is a reflection of your character.  I'm an older Gen Z, so I didn't completely grow up with AI being pre-integrated into everything and because of that I know I should afford more grace to those younger than me, but, man, I'd be so utterly embarrassed to ever turn in a paper or piece of work that I knew was written/enhanced by AI lol.  It is not serving you at all. 

TLDR: I don't like AI, lol."

1,"I actually just listened to a podcast episode by Horace Gold, a gay man, who advocated for the fact that just bc a gay man is free to be touchy with his female friends consensually doesn't mean that applies to women he doesn't know. I personally would also feel uncomfortable as a woman just bc I like my personal space, regardless if it was being invaded by a gay man, straight man, or even a woman who I don't know. I also believe Doja Cat could've been a bit more considered in her tweets, bc while sometimes fawning is instinctive and difficult to avoid, it also meant this man didn't have any idea she was uncomfortable. She could have gently clarified retroactively without insulting the man."
0,"I can understand that as a celebrity, you sometimes want to be left alone in the public eye, but on the other hand, she don't have to take herself too seriously. I've never heard of this Doja Cat, and probably a lot of other people haven't either. A little gratitude towards the fans who finance her life would be appropriate. Or at least the decency not to insult them in public. I mean, she could have just thrown away the stupid T-shirt without making such a fuss"
1,"Abt the chatGPT thing

I'm a student currently studying to become an educationer and oh my GOD I got these classmates that use the app way too much and it's infuriating. (I'm 21 btw and those i'm talking about are around 25-35) We'll like get a prompt for at project and if we need to read something and then write it down they'll just pull up ChatGPT, copy paste the article, tell CGPT to ""reformulate"" and then call it a day. It's genuinely so infuriating cause you can tell they don't care at all about the end project and then I'm sat there with maybe one or two others (if i'm lucky) that also want to do the project properly. It's so fucking annoying like you can do that on ur own idc but not on GROUP PROJECTS where OTHER people are being graded too. 
And i'll be genuinely fighting them on it everytime telling them to make it very obvious that they made it themselves and NOT a team effort cause one thing is cheating, another thing is making it seem like we all cheated just because they can't generate a single original thought for the life of them."

17,"the whole thing w the t shirt guy, his 'apology' felt so fake and more like he was promoting his shirt collection. And everything he said doja said just sounded like she was being polite because she was uncomfortable. like he didn't sound hurt he sounded annoyed that she was uncomfortable, he practically said 'im sorry for being too nice' like it's uncomfortable and gross and it doesn't matter that he's gay, he's still a man and she's still uncomfortable. It could've been a woman acting like that and she still could've been uncomfortable. just because she's a celebrity doesn't mean she's comfortable with people touching and kissing her face. and im sorry saying you like someone's shirt and have to get one soon doesn't mean give me the shirt off your back, that's craaaaaaazy thats so uncomfortable and weird. it just is a weird situation and maybe doja could've handled it with more tact but it doesn't make it okay and it doesn't make him any less weird"

They are models trained off of information we already have, so if you want to take the easy way out, at least go the extra step or two to google it and maybe watch a video. Laziness and convenience have progressed to a point that people don't even want to think for themselves anymore and it's freaking me out"
3,"I think saying that Doja should've stood up for herself instead of tweeting is a bit of a privileged take. No offense to Kurtis and I understand the reasoning there, but you can't equate yours and hers experience with fans. It ignores the parts where she's a woman, being sexually harassed by a man (no, being gay doesn't disqualify creep behavior, you still aggressively touched and grabbed her without consent) at night, in the dark, while she's being filmed, with flash in her eyes, and clearly intoxicated. There's a large power imbalance in that video which explains why she addressed it afterwards from the safety of her home. Was she mean about it? Ya, but if she wasn't, then fans would see the video and think that behavior was okay. 

If a strange man approached me like that and started filming me just because I gave him a passing compliment, I would probably also play along until, I was away, and the possibility of aggression was 0."

but not because i see some fault in THEM. i'd feel horrible for making someone i admire feel uncomfortable. that's why his response is so weird to me"
3,"as a gay man no it’s not okay to pretty much violate a woman like that just because there’s a lack of attraction. it’s infuriating to see the amount of blatant misogyny found in gay culture. it’s still objectifying a woman if you see her as nothing but “one of the girlies” “a gal pal” that you can smother and dote on, still creepy as hell and no different than a straight man doing it, anyone else doing it for that matter. still harassment, still watering down an actual human to nothing but a “girlie pop!!!”. orientation is never an excuse and that’s basically “ohh boys will be boys” in a different font"

I will admit, school has a lot of pointless lessons- but stooping so low to make a robot do the work for you is just dystopian. Not to mention that ai often times gets stuff very wrong. So there's a high likelihood of the ai misunderstanding the concept and spewing out the wrong stuff. I don't have any respect for people who use ai to do their schoolwork, people need to get up off their ass."
18,He was all over her and wouldn't let her go when she was obviously trying to pull away. Women don't speak up when they feel unsafe because we don't feel safe to speak up! I wish we could all freaky Friday each other so we could understand 😂
387,I think sometimes queer men truly forget they’re still men. They’re still capable of sexism and crossing boundaries. I think Doja took it too far but he and his friend did as well by discrediting her experiences as a woman. He was touching her inappropriately and it seems like he has a pattern of invalidating women’s feelings and their safety. Dancing in the club isn’t an invitation for men.
1,"As a queer woman, there is definitely an issue among gay men where they forget that they are still men just as much as straight guys are. Obviously not all gay men are like that, but I've seen it many times. No you can't grab my boobs just because you're not attracted to me, you don't have more access to my body because you aren't attracted to it. You can be just as scary as any other man! And all of that touching for him to not even know her name?? I'd be pissed too. Doja isn't a great person but I still wouldn't wish this kind of interaction upon any woman. I would react in a very similar way, men can switch up in an instant if you stop reciprocating in the way they want."
9,"What gets me most about the whole AI situation is I thought we were creating technology to do the mundane tasks that don’t necessarily add value to our lives but need to be done. Instead we’re using it to create art, the most fundamentally human experience and form of expression. I don’t know if it’s just that billionaires don’t share that experience or what? It’ll just never make sense to me. Also, America’s literacy is decreasing and having an AI do all your work is a bit concerning…"

1,"lifting her leg up in that hug to go around him... that's way more than I would do if I truly felt that uncomfortable. I also wouldn't be as rude to someone who appreciates me and what I do. Was it a little touchy - sure. Not offensively so. I think she's more catty than she realizes. could have been a fan, not."
1,"I am a Portuguese teacher in Brazil an AI is interfering severely with the student's abilities to write and create new ideas from scratch. Happily we do have students who really love to do creative work and will take any chance to do so but they are minority.

Also, the state I work for already started giving courses on how teachers should incorporate AI in our work planning in order to ""optimize time"", so they can stuff our days with a hundred more useless things to do instead of planning good classes and activities for our students. It's sad, really really sad."

1,"i say this as a lesbian, but theres a massive problem with gay men being misogynistic with women, and that includes assaulting us. they think that its okay to touch women and make us uncomfotbale because theyre gay, and thats not how it works, theyre just as capable of being weirdos to women as straight men."

2,I am 100% with Doja on this one. Just because he is gay doesn't mean he can invade her space. If she felt at all unsafe it's normal to react nicely for her own safety since men are violent and unpredictable. I was really cringing at his video response trying to act like being gay excuses him making a woman uncomfortable.
1,"Gay men love to excuse their behaviour towards women with their queerness, like you are still a STRANGER.

Ignore the fact that he's a man and she's a woman, no one wants to be pulled around and touched like that by a random person?"

1,Why does that Mr. Beast video also look AI-generated or made using AI
51,"All I have to say to the Doja situation is no means no. She felt uncomfortable in the situation, couldn't express it, then went on later and said this kind of behavior is unacceptable. End of conversation. I think posting videos and trying to profit off of that after is disgusting and absolutely hits home the fact that those men were in the wrong to begin with. Listen to women ya assholes."
1,24:48 i used to never think that those people that rely on chat gpt for every thing were actually real until i learned that my future sister-in-law said she’s using chat gpt to help her write her wedding vows………my jaw was on the floor when she told me that.

I might not be good but I’ve worked to improve my art for years, and not only is it unfair for AI to steal that work and others in less than a second, the environmental damage is irreparable. My dad is super into it as well, and I feel like i have to put in more effort to try and get him NOT to use it. I’m now redesigning the logo for his new business and a whole spreadsheet because otherwise he was just going to use ChatGPT. For his business. It’s exhausting. Talking about how it has changed school would be a whole separate essay, in all honesty."

1,"i can confidently say using chatgpt as a crutch has greatly inhibited my learning and i'm committing to doing my work myself now. i never had it write for me but using it for chemistry and physics has hindered my learning experience So much, it is never worth it and i urge everyone to just figure out how to solve it yourself or ask a friend"
9,"kurtis, you can 100% say period. don’t even 😭"
1,Your podcast is the only thing I listen to at work so therefore I have just listened to you talk for 8 hours almost everyday and it’s the only reason I’m not insane so thanks Kurt!
750,"i don’t like that the guy used “i’m gay” as an excuse, because gay guys can also be odd. it doesn’t matter the intention behind an action sometimes, whether or not the interaction was sexual, it was still very uncomfortable for her. i’m a gay guy but i’m not stupid enough to go around touching and kissing girls just because i’m not attracted to them."

I started my degree in 2020, when everyone was telling me my job opportunities would be aplenty as the pandemic was ruining peoples mental health. Now, 6 years later, people are turning to AI therapists and my uni course has just introduced a 3 page cover sheet declaring whether or not you've used AI in your assignments and where. I'm the only one in my cohort who doesn't use AI for assignments or client notes on placement, and its both terrifying and disgusting"
1,what pisses me off with the mr beast thing is this is taking money from artists because creators that CAN afford someone to make their thumbnails can put money into that community. but if i press a button it works 😊😊😊 you’re killing creativity!!!

Im basically one of the girls!!"" and its like. You dont need to be attracted to someone to harass them??? Stop touching and kissing complete strangers for fucks sake!!!!"
0,"About chat gpt : Personally, I'm in high school and I'm refusing to use it by pride (I'm an artist, I ain't gonna use whats directly threatening me) and also by respect for my teachers, cuz the rare times we've been given a work made by AI it really felt disrespectful. I'm damning myself to lose my mind with long aah homeworks and essays but writing is fun, I just hate the idea that my teachers might grade my work and even THINK that it might be made by AI when I actually put efforts into it."

0,"it’s interesting what happened with AI in schools, in my experience Chat GPT became popular around my second year of college, at first i only used it to do small tasks, like synthetize information etc. But as it grew in popularity, profesors just assumed everyone was “using it anyway” so they started leaving extreme ammounts of assignments, because “if we were gonna use AI, might as well make it harder”. That pushed students to need Chat GPT, in order to keep up with the ammount of assignments they were giving us👎"
371,"As a feminine person, when watching the doja cat vid it was fine and then it just...kept going. By the end I was cringing and thinking ""ok now let her go..."" as it went on. Like dude had an iron grip on her and she was obviously nervous and trying to pull away."

0,You should do a pull or study on how many girls watch your channel im curious now lol
204,34:43 no because he WAS manhandling her. The whole time I was watching the video I felt so uncomfortable. Why does he think being gay gives him an excuse to kiss a woman he doesn’t know on the mouth?
299,"Its the fact that shirt guy couldn't understand why Doja would be uncomfortable with a random guy being all over her, giving too much physical contact, ignoring her gently trying to pull away, and then making videos ignoring her thoughts and trying to make money off it is wild."

8,"i do think Doja shouldn’t have blasted him like that but gay men do need to stop just grabbing women they don’t know and assuming its okay because theyre gay. friends for sure but ya’ll beed to remember you’re still men, and ppl don’t always know you’re gay and even if they do.. some people just dont interact like that"
0,"honestly i don’t mind people using ai as a tool for their thumbnails. some people upload 7 days a week or the video is their real passion they want to put time into. but i don’t condone just stealing other people’s thumbnails and using them as a template. so long as the thumbnail actually represents the video though, and isn’t clickbait, I don’t have an issue with ai being a tool used in combination with photoshop"
14,I’m a phd student and professors actually have us use ai… I failed a course this semester because I refused to do the assignments and would instead write papers about the intersection between colonization and ai (the specific professors name is Joshua wright at city college of NY) he’s a “psychologist” (imagine telling ur psychologist ur life problems only for them to plug that ish into chat

4,"People need to understand that women, especially women who are alone like Doja was on a dark street, cant always stick up for themselves. Because you dont know what someone who is bigger than you is going to do if you reject them. There's too many stories of guys going ballistic and threatening violence because a woman rejected their advances. Many times it's safer to ""play nice"" until you can get away. There is no ""she should've handled it differently."" She handled it in the safest way she knew how to at that given time."
2,35:36 i would feel so awful as a fan to receive those tweets thats insane like thats mortifying especially after the video got popular
1,"I don’t use AI personally, but I’m kinda friends with someone who does. This person can’t write essays or even a singular paragraph on their own. They never know how to do the math we’re working on in class either because they use ai to do the equation for them. This person wants to go to college to be a nurse btw. So I’m scared too brother😪"
16,33:25 you would out spiderman?? 😭😭
2,"nothing to do with today's topics but like I've been seeing alot of hate surrounding kurtis' stand up and podcasts, saying that he's only funny when he edits and honestly I just don't understand them 
kurt is funny even without all the editing!! for me the podcast is rlly nice cause its the same humor but way more relaxed and low key
I sadly haven't had the privilege to see him on stand up since I'm from latin america but I loved python so much 🙏"
0,"I think that the gay guy didn't have bad intentions, but I also think that Doja needs to be able to have boundaries. I know that it's hard, but she is a celebrity, she should be able to say something. Or at least have a body guard. The gay guy didn't know that she was uncomfortable, he thought that she was a fan of his merch. I think that she handled it very poorly."

My sister received disciplinary action for a paper that didn't go 10 feet within an AI tool, but the software they have checking for it is horrible so it was flagged and she was failed out of that class."
0,Does anyone else listen to Kurtis' podcast not just for entertainment but also for comforting background noise?
1,Veneers comment was so correct - did he get veneers?? Why are his teeth soooo white
1182,"I think sometimes gay men forget that they are still men and are just as capable of making a woman uncomfortable. I would never want to be touched by a stranger that way and I think it is a definitively positive thing that she said something after the fact if saying something in the moment was too difficult. In every uncomfortable situation with a man we are weighing the pros and cons of being nice vs walking away, and to me it is clear that she was trying to figure out the quickest way to end the interaction without being rude. To me she was clearly uncomfortable, and I think she is allowed to make a dig at someone so oblivious to her consent. She was right to speak up, and it is not unlike any other situation where a woman in the public eye has defended herself."

107,"as a femme person who's been in social interactions that made me uncomfortable
and ended up having the exact same thoughts as doja of ""why didn't I stand up for myself"" i completely get doja and to all the people saying ""well if she was uncomfortable why didn't she say something"" trust me it's not that easy at all for a lot of people 😭 it's completely valid she felt uncomfortable and spoke on it after tha fact. also i hateee the tone of the other guys response like the ""she said no to photos in a bitchy way"" part is kinda giving when a women celeb sets boundaries you call her a bitch ALSO it's much harder to say no in this type of situation over the photos one cus the guy did not even ask if it was okay before hugging/touching her"
186,"i feel she could’ve handled the tweet better, but that guy rubs me the wrong way. we have no idea what happened before/after the video. he seemed ready to lie for clout based on the kylie thing and milked the hell out of the doja drama. he also seemed wayy to comfortable calling kylie a b¡tch."

1,the kylie jenner situation is absolutely hilarious bc why would she order from instacart with her address on there. she probably can just go herself OR send someone like an assistant to go get shit bc of the security risk. SECONDLY why the FUCK would they use the assistant's name if bro was gunna just give it up when he asked if it was Kylie's house 💀. Like ur creepy doing ur little roleplay skit about going into celebrity houses but at least make it believable fuck.

85,"even before the beef, when I saw the video with doja cat i felt so uncomfortable for her being grabbed, and kissed, and it showed that she was being polite also because she was filmed? Really difficult to set boundaries or say to that guy to back off when his friends are filming you. So... didnt feel harmless looking at it as a woman.

477,"I'll just say that when you are a woman and a man is making you feel uncomfortable (but the situation isn't obviously unsafe), it can be difficult in the moment to be assertive about your boundaries. Society has conditioned us to always smile, be polite, go along with it - and if you do something they don't like, you could then be put in danger. Being a celebrity and being filmed for social media makes it even harder when you have to be ""on"" all the time and make sure you don't do something that offends. Think about how Chappell Roan gets flack for being even the slightest bit assertive. Black women's tones are policed even more so. It seems like she's trying to be kind to her fan, but he's making her uncomfortable and he can't read the room."
0,"I hate the popularity and reliance on ai so much too guhhhh 😭😭 I've only used ai twice, just to have a goofy chat, but it wasn't even worth it.

Ai content is just stolen slop with no creativity or care, it's the go to tool for anyone who's lazy. How could anyone be proud of that?? Okay with THAT?? It's such a big problem like omg. Don't ever apologize for talking about it, you're the best Mayor ever😞😞💕"
85,"I'm in high school right now, and the AI thing is definitely a problem. Students are overly reliant on it, and teachers now have a new thing to worry about.

0,"I try to avoid using AI/ChatGPT when working on like 99% of assignments, but it can be helpful when I’m really struggling to organize the thoughts/points I already have into a format that flows smoothly. I never ask for an entire essay or paper, don’t just copy and paste whatever ChatGPT spits out, and always check/cite sources to make sure it’s correct and from a reliable source—I mostly use it as a tool to help me structure an essay or paper. I make the effort to do 99.9% of the research, writing, and work myself without any AI; I sometimes just get “stuck” in how to flow from point to point. I’m glad I didn’t have access to AI or ChatGPT as a younger child or high school student though; my critical thinking, researching abilities, and cognitive development probably would’ve been negatively impacted by it."
4,"Doja seems more triggered by the situation, maybe due to other more invasive situations that made her feel preyed on or used. But tbh, the interaction looked really pleasant. The way Doja even raised her leg to wrap around him?? I thought THAT was probably more inappropriate than everything else. I get needing boundaries and not establishing them in the moment, but it really sounds like she engaged the conversation and then maintained it. And her lack of communication is her own issue. It comes off super emotionally immature behavior to project her own failure to communicate. Like the way that man engaged with her on a social level is what you literally see at the club in the women’s bathroom with strangers. It made her actually seem more down to earth and not above the fame. Those are the pleasant, stranger moments I think anyone would love to experience on a fun night out. Whether you’re famous or not. Not saying she should be bubbly and accepting of all stranger encounters, but if she had a strong aversion towards them, then stay away from them or hire security to maintain your privacy if you can’t use your words. Like girl either pay for therapy or security. You have the funds for both honestly."

5,"If Doja was so uncomfortable but didn't show or express any of it, not standing up for herself, she had no right to be so fucking mean about it afterwards on the internet to ridicule that guy for something he did that she only showed enthusiasm for. He just seemed like an over-excited fan, calling it manhandling just seems excessive to me"
24,the interaction was def weird tho
24,oh no! i kept calling you sick (as in cool) but i accidentally manifested you being sick (as in ill)… i’m so sorry </3
1318,"In the doja cat video, while she is laughing and responding positively, she is also pulling her hands back, but he is not letting go of her wrists. I've been in this position many times, and it doesn't matter your gender or orientation, if you are drunk and on the sidewalk having a good interaction and then the stranger is now not letting go of your wrists, it is a normal survival response to act nice until you are able to get to a safe place. Idc if it's a celeb"

0,that was the best ending to this podcast that could ever happen

It could be b-roll from a different computer, but still it's really funny in this trailer for something to steal other people's thumbnail, that the recording computer has ad block enabled with that 'ab_channel=GrantRudow' suffix on the youtube address."
0,"Last year in Brasil we didnt have an actual cold day ONCE. But this year its so fucking cold, so yeah if its as hot there as it is cold here then I wish you guys the best of luck 😭"
0,"As a film student, I hear how annoying I sound, especially when I whip out the word “cinematography”😂😂 but I’m passionate about movies,What can I say"
18,I genuinely think more people should have Kurtis’ attitude with movies. I can appreciate constructive criticism but honestly it’s way more fun to watch movies when you’re not trying to be a pretentious critic about it.
0,buy a Kindle and jailbreak it kurtisss it's super worth it
11,"why is he tweaking tf out in the kylie jenner video

SHE LIVES IN A HOUSE???????? 😱😱😱"
3,those are 100% veneers lmao
3,"I’m a software developer, and we are encouraged to use ai in our workplace as a tool.  We know that what it outputs is not always 100% correct and have the knowledge to make adjustments where necessary.  This is entirely different from using ai to get through schooling."
2,I’m a preschool teacher now and in the past I have used AI to see if there are any accommodations I can do to an activity to make it more universal for children with varying abilities. I figure I would be looking for this on the internet anyway so I might as well see if AI finds anything quickly instead of spending hours looking through websites until I find something that applies to the activity. I also still go on to check the website that the AI got its information from to make sure it’s a trusted source of information for teachers and curriculum planning. It cuts my time planning for activities by a little and I’m already getting paid so terribly I try not to put a ridiculous amount of hours into work outside of contract hours. I still do work outside those hours but this makes it so I may get an hour extra on the weekend and the children don’t suffer from me trying to have a work/life balance.
0,instead of period straight men should say ejaculate. thank you for coming to my tedtalk.
3,Mr beasts teeth dont look right... too straight.. i dunno...
0,26:31 yeah...i gotta gooo
6,Sorry but i hate Doja Cat. Yeah whatever she doesnt owe anyone anything but its also called not being an asshole. Shes just seems rude as hell. This is just my opinion so nobody freak out at me i wont respond anyway.
2,Careful Kurtis people can become dependent on Vicks inhalers and nose sprayers ! The more you know
0,Kurtis looks like a proper mayor today 👍
31,"I met with Danny &  Drew on their tour with Kurtis.  If they had tweeted about how shitty the interaction was after I thought it went well, I would be DEVASTATED. If an artist doesn’t want to do meet and greets, fine. That’s their boundary. But for Doja to not set boundaries for herself and then make fun of a fan online bc of it…..yikes"
0,@7:10 bro described the idiocracy movie
0,kurtis should watch august underground and then get back to us about the movie thing
1,"I'm a PhD student who teaches university-level students and this generative AI nonsense is doing nothing but making my job harder and making our students less thoughtful. Look into the MIT study on how ChatGPT affects the brain. It's so exhausting to be a teacher right now, and I was a middle school teacher at the height of lockdown returns in 2021. I even had to go off on one of my instructors during my certificate program training because it asked us to *use ChatGPT* and I said I was fully abstaining from the assignment because I'd never used it and never would, and I didn't feel comfortable feeding work *that was not my own* into the theft machine. (I still passed but jfc I was so angry I went off during the feedback at the  end of term because I thought it was incredibly morally irresponsible from a university that's existed since the 1400s, so you'd think they'd learn something in that time)."
1,"the ai thumbnails seem very on brand for mr beast. i feel like mr beast - among other youtubers - have turned making content into some corporate make money thing. there is hardly any passion or soul in those channels - with or without ai. it doesn't feel like a passion project or something they enjoy. just something that'll get them money super fast with little to no effort. kinda like those ""alpha males"" who sell ""courses"" that don't do anything except waste people's time and money."
1,"I've used AI for school a few times to explain concepts when I've been stuck because I've had a few shit professors who respond to all questions with ""you're a college student. Figure it out."" I really try to avoid it now because of how much it hurts artists, impacts communities, and causes environmental damage."
0,lets fucking gooo another episode dropped 😛
1,"In my opinion, it doesn’t matter that it’s pride month. 
And as someone who presents female and is genderfluid and pansexual. 

No man should ever approach a woman walking alone at night. 
It doesn’t matter what your sexuality is, she didn’t know them. 
It’s not crazy to think she’d be deeply uncomfortable.
Plus he literally touched her multiple times. THAT IS WEIRD. DO NOT TOUCH PEOPLE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THEM.

Dude when people I don’t know touch me. I immediately don’t like them. Like why are you touching me!!???"
95,"24:27 as a student in high school currently, a majority of my peers use chatgpt. Even the ""smart"" ones in honors and aps. They trust it as a resource, they make it do their assignments, and more. As a writer who is anti ai, I feel like I'm talking to a wall talking to my classmates about how bad ai is. It's so scary how these kids are our future, and they refuse to think about something for more than 15 seconds."
2,My two worlds colliding
8,i like to try and guess what sound effect he’s gonna play while he’s looking for it. sometimes it’s a drinking game
94,25:00 One of the kids I babysit in the 5th grade told me about how EVERYONE uses chat gpt to construct their essays and help them with their assignments. This is when we develop these critical thinking skills and being dependent on AI at the age of 9 to think for you is terrifying.
1551,"I feel like that guy was very much acting based on gay culture and how common it is for gay men to be touchy and comfortable with women like that, but I also think he could have been a little bit more sensitive to the fact that his parasocial relationship with Doja doesn’t mean they’re besties. And then on the other hand Doja should have stood up for herself and politely deescalated the interaction instead of fawning if she was uncomfortable, but I don’t blame her for how she felt about it and how it’s often instinctive and easier for women to mirror friendly behaviour when you’re alone and feeling slightly unsafe, especially as a celebrity. I don’t think this guy is at fault, it’s just an unfortunate situation."
1,thanks for the movie review mr mayor
1,"Ngl, I feel robbed it took YouTube an hour to tell me you even put this up but happy you did!"

0,"AI feels insidious, you’re completely right. They want ppl to become reliant on it, so they can’t think and then start charging for it, or manipulate it to make ppl think the way they want."
1,“period….” 😂😂😂
36,pavloved myself into feeling sleepy every time i hear the intro music
0,my sister actually used chatgpt to respond to a message i sent her telling her i felt like she was using me for my money it sucked the fact she couldn’t take the time out of her day to make a response from heart.
5,"""glorifies being musty"""
0,yaaaaas get a kindle girly
219,"Doja Cat is right, he was grabbing at her, many times. She was clearly trying to leave and he just kept dancing with her, hugging her, it’s weird as hell."
5,she wasn't being fake she was scared. men are scary whether they say/act like they're gay or not esp bc some lie about it to get closer to women. a lot of gay men are misogynistic and then victimize themselves when called out. im a lesbian and i love gay men but we can do better lol
0,"thanks for the vid, kurty-wurty"
3,"DUDE you guise in Canada say ""pop"" too?!? I'm from Ohio and when I travel no one knows what I mean lol"

6,8:54 I FUCKING LOVE THOSE VICKS THINGS!!!!! Used them when I had jaw surgery and my nose was so swollen and stuffed up. Total lifesavers those are
29,I’m pretty sure he was saying “period” to what his friend said. Like “Doja the best of all time” and the friend is like “end of sentence. No explanation needed or given.” He’s not just yelling period. He’s saying sentence said it all.
0,"i’m a senior in college and the only time i have to use my brain for school is to write essays and do projects. everything else (homework, notes, quizzes, exams) ai does for me, mostly so i have more time to work on the projects."

0,My favorite episode period 🎉
0,"Honestly those especíific gay dudes were much worse than doja, even if she is wrong (she is right in some parts tho). Sad that actually a lot of gay men forget that they ARE MEN, and act like that."
23,"36:38 i honestly feel a lil divided. if everything the guy said is true, giving his shirt was rly sweet imo. the kiss on the face is still crazy tho"

0,"It's probably like 20° degrees in Canada and Kurtis is saying it's super hot, my ass in that weather it's freezing I can't imagine the winter up there"
1,I personally have never used ChatGPT for college/school stuff because I actually wanna learn but I do know that a lot of students use it for studying (not hard to do by yourself) and for generating papers (again - not hard to just write your own paper)
528,"24:20 about the chatgpt at school, we are NO LONGER ALLOWED TO WORK ON ESSAYS OUTSIDE OF CLASS. all the teachers have to ai check ever single paper now. everyone uses chat gpt for their homework, and there like really isnt anything the teachers can do about it. it really sucks, i hate ai. ive also noticed like how dependent people are on it for school now. its literally making ppl dumber its so sad."
1,It’s like he knew I was going on a road trip
24,Yes Taylor does have a song called You Need to Calm Down and it was coincidentally related to pride so that's hilarious that u mentioned that
0,mr. beast clearly IS an idiot with that incorrect possessive S on the 2021 tweet lol
8,"Ms. Doja seemed to realize she could change the search results for ""Doja Cat T-shirt"" LMAO. dude was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. she can date a guy who sends her fans dih pics from HER HOUSE, but a fan maybe being a little too friendly is too much... like okay."

3,I don’t know if you get told this often but PLEASE never feel like you have to rush your videos and content just to feed us 🫶🏼 I actually appreciate it more when content creators put thought and effort into their videos and it brings more joy to watch and real citizens of Kurtistown would never rush perfection from the mayor

5,"I'm convinced Doja Cat started this drama on purpose because before this happened if you googled ""Doja Cat shirt"" you'd get results about her wearing a tshirt with the alt-right comedian Sam Hyde on it. She made drama about a shirt on purpose to change the results."

0,i too do a big BOOM every time boom is said in a sentence
1,"I just got into pokemon like 4 months ago cause of a random spheal video (pokemon is not that hyped nor popular in my country) (also spheal is the absolute best op poweful pokemon btw :3). Then I  got into the anime, pokemon go and cards too and this is really so fucking frustrating when its already so hard for me to get cards ;-; like i dont even care about getting super valuable stuff or anything lol I just love the characters and collecting 😭😭"
2,"Kurtis, help I'm hiding under a towel and a blanket because there's a moth in my room and idk what to do💔"
0,"i used to work retail at a department store that sold pokemon stuff and we had to place a limit on the number of packs (singles and ETBs) AND put cameras directly over the aisle where we had the cards because people were always stealing them. pokemon wasn't super big at the time so we often didn't have problems, but still got enough attention that we needed to put store measures in place."
0,23:50  same shit different ass
0,Kurtis can you explain to me what a brain blast is? lol
0,38:20 So rip the box from the hands of a man bigger than her and possibly get into an altercation? How about adults stop scalping cards and let the kids have fun with something meant for kids?

2,"I’m sorry, I’ve never heard of Pokémon scalpers before but like, is that a fuckinh Blood Meridian reference? Calling them scalpers? That’s insane if it’s true, the implications of that are wild."
1,Get Jack innanen on the pod
1,idk if you're going anywhere near Kentucky on your tour but there's a tattoo artist in Hodgenville KY who does AMAZING Pokemon tattoos. Her name is Alexis Behlmann 1000000/10 recommend. She's done all of my tattoos 😌
2,Complete Digimon collection!  AWESOME!!  WELL DONE!!
3,"my bf recorded the video with the kid and he did end up grabbing a blister but the dude cleared all the etbs before he asked if we wanted anything, luckily we had grabbed an etb each before he showed up but it was so like…. awful we all just stood there and watched in shock 36:41"
1,maybe you’ll be a dad consider having kids the world nees them your kids im sorry
1,CONGRATS ON FINISHING YOUR DIGIMON COLLECTION!!
0,From the biggest w of completing the collection to the saddest video of some lowlife scalper trampling over a kids day.
0,You should send a super professional sounding email to these scalpers pretending to be a vendor saying you’re gonna be restocking the local Walmart and wanted to let other buyers in the area know the time to be there.
4,"my local london drugs (canadian store) let me have the cashiers give away my limit of 6 packs of pokemon cards. i asked them to hold onto the packs behind the desk and to 6 kids each who missed the restock. was there when destined rivals dropped, and my bf and i shared his 6 packs and i was able to give away my 6. i was a kid who grew up with pokemon cards, at a time when they were just free to grab off the shelf for yourself not hidden behind glass or limited per person. i still collect but i wanted to give some kids the same childhood experience, because i KNOW no kids were able to hit that restock. it was like 7am on saturday lol. if you have the spare cash please try this too, even if its just one pack to give away to the next kid that comes in. give the kids a chance to enjoy the hobby made for them. not sure which stores would allow it but it doesnt hurt to ask"
0,It's crazy you'll never be a dad cause you do be rockin that dad style
0,29:03 KurtHAYs ConnHORSE
0,44:20 the scalper strat is if so many people are scalping that you HAVE to go to the secondary market they'll make money so some of these losers will be stuck holding the bag when the hype dies and they can't sell the cards for more than retail
0,im watching this on the day the pokemon ETB came out and i wasn’t able to get a single one at 11 different stores cause they were sold out 🥲
0,38:21 white people picking up the term Karen and misusing like this is crazy. No recording someone doing something wrong instead of getting in an altercation is not Karen behavior. A Karen is someone that weaponizes their white femininity to get black people abused by police/white men
0,"Man I can drink Timmie’s anymore, it’s either 1250 degrees or just tastes raunchy, likely because it was recently 1250 degrees"
2,"What sucks is that the scalpers have no love for the game. Its purely for profit.

PLEASE, it was such a bop and I can’t find it anywhere it went like “Hey, what’s up! Is nice to meet ya, it’s Kurtis korner, it’s Kurtis korner time!” It was so fire I swear."

1,"I hate the word childish, children have the most amout of potential, they are the easiest to correct and teach, they re the most understanding. Being childish isn't a description of something bad. Adults act ""childish"" 24/7. The whole ideology is everyone's playing a big game of pretend, and they are so stuck in this game they forgot it's all make believe. Being an adult doesn't make you anything, doing what people have been doing for the entirety of America isn't a thing I should respect because you feel you deserve it for those reasons."
0,I remember when Pokemon Diamond/Pearl came out I was in grade 4 and I went to a game store to get it with my parents money and this dude had a whole cart full of the games😭  kids these days will never understand the pain of a 50 year old balding man taking all the games on release day

0,"i work at a store where we sell pokemon cards and i stg those customers are ruining the job for me, grown adults fighting like children meanwhile the actual children don’t even get any cards it pmo so ty for talking about this!"
11,36:41 it's a lack of shame too. People need to be physically stopping them from being able to do this by shaming them and a blanket refusal to buy from resellers... SMH so sad

1,"I used nicotine gum once trying to quit smoking. It not only didn’t make the cravings go away, it also made me nauseous to the point I puked. It tasted horrific, like you can tell it has an obscene amount of chemicals in it. Nicotine patches made me sick once too. Not sure why.   Something about -through the skin 
 nicotine didn’t… metabolize right or something for me? Who knows."

7,"Brushing my teeth has always been tough for me to remember, but I learned that any plaque on your teeth hardens within 24 hours to where you can't brush it off. I still have bad days, but knowing that made me more conscious of when my mouth is dirty. So if you also struggle, there's a fact that might help you."
0,44:58 the type of greed they talk about in the bible btw
0,Labubu is plushie keychain inspired by korean monsters and it is addictive because they come in surprise boxes so you don't know what are you buying which makes buying them all hard. And when people buy all they discover big plush versions. And then clothes for labubus. And than bags for labubus with labubu keychain for your labubu keychain.
9,Scalpers are annoying because they turn most regular hobbies into a more stressful time than it needs to be. I LOVE spending time stressed about stock on the thing I want to get because many others decided it would be better to buy up all the stock and resell it vs letting those who would actually use the shit they're buying actually buy and use it.
4,"Idk if it’s my autism or whatever, but I’ve gone back and rewatched that digimon video you made at least 5 times now just about twice a year.. idk why it’s just a really good story to me and means a lot"
2,"on the topic of scalping pokemon cards, did you know people scalp build a bears? for example, there was a limited edition mothman one last year and it sold out so quick just by scalpers. literally so horrible those are teddy bears for kids whats wrong with people."
2,Scalping a hobby intended for kids is such loser shit man. I love pokemon still in my 20s because I got to have those core memories buying packs with my grandma at the store when I was young

0,Tatt artist in Saint Paul MN! Private studio w the best vibes n we can watch Pokémon while we do it <3!!!! Hit us up @ Hard Headz !!!
0,I was at work yesterday morning and listening to old episodes I've seen before and then when I got home you dropped this EP and I was like damn.
0,"i am not defending scalpers, but you gotta keep in mind that a lot of scalpers bring their kids with them because sometimes there is a limit per person, but also because people are more likely to share the product with a kid.  so there is a good chance that this parent and child would have done exactly what this man did if they got there first. lol it sucks ass right now."
0,I am 29 😅 and I did buy a Labubu it’s like a surprise box Toy so you get the dopamine of opening it and then you get this cute little monster key ring to put on your bag. They are designed by a Hong Kong artist called Kasing Lung. I love mine but I do think they scream recession as people change their spending habits.
2,I saw someone on tiktok saying people's hate for overconsumption of labubus is individualistic and anti-community LMAO
0,"19:34 fork found in kitchen, I swear we knew this earlier lol I wasn’t as surprised by this"
1,Just wait until you unearth the Disney scalpers 🤧 the WORST second hand embarrassment. Anytime i see them power walking thru the parks with 30 popcorn buckets and 18 Goofy hoodies i give them a phat thumbs down. It’s worse when they make their kids carry the product too

0,"we sell pokémon cards where i work. we have limits now so more people get a chance, but still so sad when kids want just 1 pack and we have none :("
0,Kurtis you are 30 you should know how to brush your teeth 🤢
0,@22:17 Elon wants to cut all these government programs but when it comes to his he’s mad?? 😭 like dude you are billionaire in large part because of American taxpayers. finance it yourself at this point!!
0,@21:15 also how does Elon know that?? Is he self-reporting because how would he have these documents? That either means he knows because he’s been there himself or somebody told him and he was just fine with it hiding it until trump didn’t benefit him anymore
0,Congrats kurt
1,"the comment at 38:20 is insane because like do you see how fucking huge that scalper guy is? the angle for the camera is pretty low as well so it was most likely filmed by a smaller person too

how tf are you gonna blame the kid and their parent for not daring to grab shit from this huge ass dude who might or might not be insane enough to start pushing you around and harassing you after you take something that he thinks he's entitled to, because lord fucking knows we have to think about that kinda shit nowadays"

You don’t NEED to buy the whole fuckin stock out scum bag, you could leave some for your fellow man."
205,"Kurtis that first Pokemon scalper was the kid's dad from your baseball team. You got him hooked on Nicotine so bad due to gum + cigarettes that now he has to scalp Pokemon cards to fund his addiction. The heartbreak in that poor child's eyes is all your fault, Kurtis."

59,i work at target as security- mfs will deadass start fighting and throwing hands to get a set to just resell it. there are genuine kids who just want to play with them.. then there’s grown adults stuffing their bags and stealing large quantities of sets. it’s very disappointing.

8,36:35 that poor kiddo :( let him get his card dude.
4,1:51 dentist will not not laugh at you
7,They should have limits on Pokemon cards again
1,"""am i a horse?... fuck i guess so"" hahahahaha lost it"
4,"labubus are the new trendy accessory. i don't really get them either, i think they look pretty unappealing. its a blind box though, and they have chasers, so it gets people in a gambling mindset because they can't just buy the one they want, they probably need to buy four boxes to get the one they want. so that adds to the demand; barely anyone just buys one blind box. also like celebrities have them so that helped popularize them."
0,So thankful for these Sunday posts.
1,The amount of videos I’ve seen of grown men paying thousands and buying them out- it’s so bad
0,21:18 thank you for saying this.. exactly what’s on my mind with this whole elon debacle.

Edit: title your video as is it's multiple topics (because it is) and people like me would watch the whole thing instead of commenting like this"
1,I work at Target and I’ve had to tell so many little kids we don’t have any Pokémon cards bc grown ass men bought them all
0,"The major retail stores should set a limit, so at the very least if you get there for a restock you can get something / at the same time grab your kid a pack or tell your kid to grab a pack instead of just filming this loser"
1,i start beating my chest and running around on my knuckles like a gorilla whenever i get a post notif for this pod
0,Hey Kurtis can you reprint some more Kurtis colection cards? 😅😂
8,Finally kurtis responds to the mullet+mustache hate

49,kurtis you should get a podcast
0,"A couple months ago when Pokemon were officially off of the shelves, I found a STACK of packs of Paldea Evolved under the mess of the blind box/ collection section in Target. 

There were 5 whole packs and (I paid for 3 bc fck Target) and left one on display in the card section. I really hope there was a good pull in that one so some kid could have it.

Pokemon is my thing bro. Got an Abra tattoo and all that jazz. I only bought them because the store was gonna close and I know they'd put them in claims if no one bought them..."
151,"3:27 when I was a kid, I thought if I brushed my teeth well enough before seeing the dentist, they'd just be like, ""oh yeah, job done, no need!"" and just let me go home lol"
0,Ily too HAPPY PRIDEEE
4,"dude, I'm so embarrassed of my country 🤦🏻‍♀ I'm sorry we are the worst neighbors.  Kurtis, plz send help lol"
0,Kurtis come to belgium
2,I can't wait to see him with a buzzcut
4,kurtis i just wanted to let you know i burped right before you did at 15:27 while i was watching this so i think we might be quantum entangled
1,a crazy MAGA girl in my dms tried to say that the photos of Trump with Epstein were AI. MAGA is truly a cult and nothing could make me think otherwise
0,32:40 I fucking loved that video
0,ª
8,nicotine coffee 29:08
2,Younger sister had to explain Labubu to me cause I genuinely thought she meant to say “Bubulubu” (delicious little Mexican treat of marshmallow with a layer of jelly covered in chocolate) I still don’t get it really
4,Bruh my local target had to put a one per person limit on all the Pokémon stuff which sucks for us normal people cause I kinda wanted two single packs 😔
77,"Dude I went to take a friend's kid to get some Pokemon cards, and like *every* store was sold out. One game store had Japanese stock and that was it. They live in a pretty big city too. If we had really dug around at every Target and Walmart and shit we may have found some, but like, holy shit dude. Just let kids have fun. At Walmart the entire half-wall shelf of cards was gone except for one ripped open box."
18,11:12 surprised he didnt reference that halloween episode of spongebob where patrick shaves spongebob down for his ghost halloween costume
139,"21:01 The Trump and Epstein thing has been out for awhile now, a woman took him to court for SA her multiple times at epsteins parties when she was 13 years old and trump took such a liking to her bc he said she resembled his daughter. She sadly lost the case but probably got lost in all the other trials hes been in"
4,Never clicked on a video so quick omg i needed Kurtis to talk abt this
2,the pokémon card scalpers are fuckin gross man. i worked at a barnes & noble and we had to limit the amount you can purchase on all of them because of people like this. and they’d still try to work around the purchase limit by bringing in their girlfriend or someone else with them. they’d even wait around when they knew we got new shipments in that hadn’t been received yet 😭
0,I got cheated on this will make me feel better lol
29,"i work retail at target and we get HUGE lines of people when we restock the cards. its mostly adults and a lot of them end up reselling them :( it makes me feel bad for the people that actually wanted them, especially the kids"
5,"From my knowledge, mostly from tiktok: Labubus are a character a part of ""The Monsters"" collections, sold by Popmart(a retail company for blind boxes). They are little monsters with wide eyes and a teethy, creepy?/mischievous? smile. Many people collect and adore the fuzzy labubu bag charms that are purchased in blind boxes. Real labubus sell out fast and are often resold for hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars, but fake labubus (typically called lafufus) are sold by lots of random sellers."
0,"at least one of the masks is a respirator, so for protecting against sickness not to hide identity"
3,She pokemon on my card till i insanity
62,There are supposed to be limits on cards at Target and GameStop as an FYI to collectors. I'd call ahead to your local store first bc sometimes it's by location.
1,Will you please straighten your hair and take a picture before you cut it. I also was an early mullet adopter. Had to let it go a few months ago
94,"49:35 Labubus are collectibles that come in mystery boxes that you can buy at pop mart, they became popular after people found out Lisa from Black Pink collects them so now it’s kind of a fashion statement"

0,"For the song, “beautiful things”… I felt like it tapped into a very real sense of grief I have carried all my life after losing a loved one. I remember desperately bargaining with the universe itself at that point.. and for the lyrics to spell it out so plainly.. gives me a weird sense of comfort. But yeah, I get that that’s not for everyone either. There’s a beauty to leaving things unsaid. I just.. find the beauty in outright saying it too. I am grateful to Benson Boone for making that song.  :)"

0,THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT THE ALEX WARREN THAT SANG THAT ANNOYING ASS TIKTOK SONG IS THE SAME GUY WHO GOT DRAGGED FOR COPYING D*VID D*BRIK A FEW YEARS AGO?? 😭😭😭
1,"As someone with health anxiety, I mainly ask chat gpt random specific medical questions and then ignore it when it asks if I want to talk more 😅"
0,"I wouldn't classify Dr Mike as an alpha bro, not that he's a feminist, hes just kinda chaotic. Still kinda sad he fell for AI trash though lol, especially when we know they made chatgpt so sycophantic that ofc its gonna glaze you to keep you using it lol"
2,"Kurt im on your side w the AI thing mostly, but Im 29 and someone tried to kill me in my apt about a year ana half ago. i went from extroverted to unable to leave my place. i obviously was in EXTENSIVE therapy but the thing that was most surprising socially was that i started using gpt for tutor help for my degree and it ended up helping me a lot with getting comfortable interacting again without assuming every conversation was a trap. I cried many times. (ALSO I very much agree if youre not careful about it it could do the opposite for someone in the same situation and convince them they dont need human connection anymore, but i dont think its all bad)"

1,I’ve always felt like Benny balloonson is an industry plant 🪴
0,"And that whole genre of music is my least favorite, I think worse than country. it's the new version of John Mellencamp (he is the #1 artist whose music makes me want to rip my soul out of my body and put it through a shredder)"
0,"I can't stand Benson boone! Ughhh! And seriously, you had the curly mullet and moustache first right? He totally ripped you off!"
1,Justin and Hailey has the weirdest relationship dynamic.. I wonder if their marriage was arranged or forced upon him.. if he was convinced by someone to marry her.

I’ve been alone for like 2 years and there were so many times I needed someone to just like casual talk to and like just not feel so alone yk

I was in a moment of weakness and decided to talk to Aria on Opera 💀 idk how people can casually talk to Ai and feel so “close” and connected ig lol 
Idk how ppl do it.. It made me feel soooo much worse about myself because I was such a loser and had to result to talking to my browser 🗿"

0,I don’t get the hate on the suburbs song guy I think everyone’s being so harsh for no reason?? I just think it’s so counterproductive and downright mean. Bro just wants to sing his lil song and make his lil music! Doesn’t mean we have to like it or listen to it. It’s okay to say hm not for me and move on
0,He comes from a long line of Jellyrolls

0,Ford Truck Music is a great term.
0,Can anyone acknowledge that Jelly Roll is a known s-offender?? Why is everyone supporting this man I don’t understand
0,"Grouping Benson Boone in with those other guys is crazy to me.. Kurtis just doesn’t know his other songs, they are not that similar to Beautiful Things. I think that specific song of Benson’s is just a little overrated"
0,wait the guy singing in that video ISNT BENSON BOONE???????
0,Kurtis I talk to AI 😅 is that too weird it's usually when I'm curious/bored or super depressed/feeling stuck and no I'm not using it as a therapist I have a therapist I see her weekly but she can't be available 24/7 and I wouldn't want her too I'd never stop talking 😂
0,Benson Boone is to 2025 what the indie rock vibes of imagine dragons/mumford and sons was to 2012

0,WAIT HOW DID I JUST REALISE THAT ALEX WARREN IS THAT ALEX WARREN BRO WHAT
1,i did not except to see Mike Israetel (the bald guy) on this podcast lmaooo he’s like the embarrassing grandpa of the fitness community he knows a lot of science about lifting but with everything else he is definitely kooky
0,"The “alpha male” guy is actually just a fitness influencer named Dr. Mike Israetel. I wouldn’t consider him part of the alpha male community. He’s a really genuine guy but at the same time, very unserious and this is his sense of humor. He’s most likely trolling in that clip haha"
3,Dude I remember when alex warren was hosting america’s next top influencer what the hell is happening
0,the funniest part about the ai shit is that whatever the ai said to make him cry was 1000000% something that a 14 year old would post on their tumblr in 2012
0,44:00 it's like if Ed Sheeran was more youth pastor-y and it's NOT good
0,"Kurtis, I'm surprised that you don't like Benson Boone. Him and Harry Styles aren't dissimilar in their style of music. Honestly, Benson Boone is better. He makes songs from his life experiences."
0,Hailey Bieber deserves so much better.
0,"Benson Boone creeps me out with his youth group fuckboi vibe but his songs are so fucking gooooodddd... ugh, I'll get tired of it eventually but I'm not moving onto these new guys on the scene"
0,It’s called skydome
0,"Yoooo your the best man, but the dude with the head vein talking about AI is doctor mike and is NOT an alfa male, he talks sh*** about himself regularly... he would agree with you that he is alone with no friends, seriously he knows he aint shit and says it all the time... i HATE ""alpha male"" bros, and dr. Mike is def. Not one..."
0,i love watching not-really bad
1,13:11 now why would he go straight to sprained ankle PLS
28,"47:50 I actually thought when this video started circulating that it was a worship set. That’s the set up a lot of worship teams use to film worship sets, the band in the middle and the people surrounding them😭😭"

29,"Yesterday meta asked me how it could help me and I felt seen for the first time in my life. I fell down to my knees and shat and cried, I was in a pool of shit and tears and truely felt happiness for the first time."
2,"Ai is also inherently fascist and ruins the environment even further with the server halls and the water cooling they need. Sidenote I love when toxic straight cismen use the term ""leave the matrix"", not knowing it is an analogy for being trans"
1,"The alpha male ai thing makes sense bc those types of men are too afraid to be vulnerable with actual real people so they can only do it with a simulacra of a person that's ""safe"" (ie will never face them w any perceived rejection or anything other than compliance and full support)"
2,bruh the way the Brendan guy sings is like when jerma sings for a bit
49,"omg kurt’s story about looking up jellyroll reminded me many years ago i was talking about the drag queen, Milk and I wanted to show someone a photo and I just searched “milk” 😭😭😭"

0,22:02 this moment deserves the podcast emmy award
0,"i actually saw brendan abernathy cause he opened for sofia isella before all this happened and i met him after the show, he’s a really nice guy who really cares about what he’s doing and he was good! idk it sucks to see a lot of people be negative about someone just being passionate and vulnerable about what they love ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

let’s just let people be cringe if they wanna and instead hate on people who deserve it"
3,22:05 Not Kurtis being in the right key again!!! This dude has perfect pitch I swear
1,"Jelly Roll Morton was a famous jazz musician. I don’t know if that’s where Jelly Roll took his name from, I just needed to share that fact to justify the jazz studies minor I paid way too much to get."
0,An actual good band with something new to offer that isn't just a clone - Holywatr!! I'm telling y'all.. its my new favorite band I fucking love them

0,Dont disrepsect my man Benny with that tiptoe sh*t
0,"No bcs the medical terminology textbook is taking me out- I just finished a medical terminology course and it's literally like shes reading a medical dictionary, nothing really about anatomy or physiology or pharmacology- That's so hilarious"
0,I used to watch some mike israetel videos (the bald guy talking about ai) because he had made interesting bodybuilding videos. seeing him here saying the dumbest shit ive ever heard in my life was the final nail in the coffin for the idea of ever doing steroids. that man literally has brain rot
2,Who's going to tell Kurtis that 'beautiful things' is in a bmw commercial in the UK (I hate that song with my entire being)
1,"Take your time uploading videos, we’re just happy to see ya when you!"

Hes a very nice guy"
0,Yoooo I’ve been locked in on Stardew Valley lately too. Downloaded a bunch of mods on my steam deck and can’t stop playing. 🤣
9,The fact that Justin Bieber told the world this story means he really didn’t learn from it and didn’t see anything wrong with it. This is normal behaviour to him.
0,"12:41 if you dont want the ai overview, you can type -ai (make sure its a minus sign) at the end of your search and it wont come up!"

204,that new genre is something i call “conservative culture pop music” and i also fucking hate it
0,dr mike its not an alpha male...
0,I call it Springsteen stolen valor music
0,"Hell yeah, so much Kurtis singing content"
1,"Kurt that video of the guy talking about ai is Mike Isratel. He's a great, funny fitness influencer. Idk why you gotta hate on him lol. You're making him out to seem like he's just another alpha asshole but he's a really chill and smart guy, he's a doctor."
7,"It’s like an insincere hipster version of Good Luck, Babe!"
0,I don’t listen to pop music but Benson Boones music is so painfully white 😭
3,the fact that Alex Warren was a hype house member who copied everything about David Dobrick is WILD.
0,The hootin and hollerin epidemic

0,22:00 made me laugh at work lol the lyrics do be hitting tho 🔥🔥
0,"I hate that song ""plz stay"" like dude it won't be god's fault if ur wife leaves u or whatever. I hear this song SEVERAL times a day at work and omg i CANNOT STAND IT. 
Same with the u gotta a nice car. Like stfu"
4,"Chatgpt is programmed to give empathetic response and glaze you. So for someone who rarely receives empathy from another human being, it's kinda nice talking to a robot who pumped you up with zero judgement no matter how stupid your questions are. People can be judgemental sometimes and robot has no capacity to be judgemental (unless you told them to). But if you have a spouse then talk to your spouse, not a robot."
0,AFYCSO PANIC MENTIONED 🗣️🗣️🗣️
0,"For a second i didnt know who the rapper was so i thought you were talking about the great and historic jazz pianist, Jellyroll Morton ... like jellyroll morton's ghost and post malone"
1,"About the AI thing: you'd be surprised the amouth of people I've seen relying on that darn chat gpt. It's a serious issue because some of them genuinely act like they're gonna die if they dont embrasse AI as ""it's the next stage of our evolution"" (yes real sentence I was told). I've had AI generated replies from these people on why AI isnt bad. These people can't even think for themselves anymore. Also saw someone saying how they use AI for their art job which, an art carreer is a choice (as a fellow artist). It's not to make ends meet like working as a cashier. It's something you went to school for because you actually enjoy it. If you're looking for ways to make your work faster instead of enjoying the art process, you're in the wrong carreer I'm sorry. When I try to talk to these people, they act like I'm so behind and egotistical for wanting to still do things the human way. I got called ableist and anti-evolution for saying chat gpt is not a therapist. Someone even replying ""I hope chat gpt makes all therapist go out of business"" and the replies we're hearts and support.. a comment that was left under an AI generated memes on how HUMANE AND CONFORTING AI IS. Do these people not have friends, genuinely. Because they're posting this on a mental health support group, when they could instead focus on making connection to people in that group that have lived similar experiences. I tried many times to comment under their ""pro AI""  posts and everytime I got told off. I got told ""we do not care your opinion is not valid nor wanted because chat gpt understands us and we get to have meaningful conversations with it""... exactly with IT. Not with them, with IT, it's not a person, it doesn't have feelings, it is spitting whatever you wanna hear. AI isn't getting more humane, humans are getting dumber. Sorry for the long paragraph, these kind of people make me very mad and I could go on for so long about it."
5,"17:33 that is Dr Mike Israetel and he is actually a very intelligent and funny man. Not saying I agree with his take on AI but he is not an ""alpha male"" by any means and he is very well respected within the fitness community.
I think if you gave him a chance you would actually find him quite funny."
0,im lowkey mad that u brought up build god then we'll talk 😭😭😭had a sudden urge to pause the video to sing the whole rest of the song bc my brain wouldn't let it go !

1,why are titles of these things hardly mentioned?? like bro i clicked this bc i wanted to hear his opinion on benson boone wtf is he going on abt rn.. AND THERES NO CHAPTER DEDICATED TO THE TITLE CONCEPT
0,"not to be a hater but the bald man in the ""alpha males in ai"" section is known for being very dry and satirical, so i am assuming he is being unserious in the clip. he was also on a podcast episode with doctor mike that is worth the watch :)"
1,Mooooore stardew commentary
14,19:03 I literally went on a Panic! At The Disco side mission while trying to watch this video. lol

0,“that was a fun little boner” new vocal stim at what cost
1,Finally someone talking about their ‘music’
0,i hate when people do that speech impediment joke.
7,It’s actually crazy that Brendan Abernathy has come to my home town multiple times and in 8 th grade every one tried to convince me to go and I said heckkk noo but now I lowkey wish I went

1409,"Justin Bieber telling his wife “You’ll never be on the cover of Vogue” reminds me of the time my 3 year old was pissed that I wouldn’t let her bring home a stray cat from the park. On the drive home she said, “Mom, you’ll NEVER be as beautiful as that cat.”  To this day, it remains one of the sickest & most hilarious burns I’ve ever received. The fact that Bieber talks to his wife like a pissed off toddler AND tells the world about it is mind blowing."

0,the truck commercial song bit had me crying omg
2,Why does every dude look like  a young Weird Al Yankovic now?
0,Man. Beers always be trying to kiss me too Kurtis. The hangovers suck.
1,finding out kurtis liked superheaven made my heart do a backflip because ive been obsessing over them this year every since i saw them in concert last October
1,the arcade video killed me like imagine being the employee on shift during that
0,"17:56 I actually think that people that creates bounds with AI are deeply lonely and delusional and it should be taking more seriously ! 

I hate AI mostly because it’s such a way to confuse your brain and deconnect from reality ( on top of stealing other people art work and jobs lol ) 💀

Idk this man on the video should look for emotional and intellectual connection with someone real because it looks like he need it

Justin saying that to Hailey is so weird because she is a professional model so It’s not like it’s a joke , he’s saying that specifically to hurt her and belittle her and her capabilities. 😅"
3,"I fear those who talk to AI lack major critical thinking skills. Yeah it comes up with things within seconds, it’s taking it from thousands of sources online. People convince themself that it is an actual sentient being versus a computer program. 
I’ve learned there are people who use it for therapy which worries me deeply. AI is going to give you what it thinks you want to hear."
0,18:14 PANIC REF AFYCSO REF 18:34 HIM SINGING IT HELPP

0,"The ai guy….holy balls we are doomed as a society. One second the internet goes out, he’s screwed. Justin bieber seems like he has a lot of anger inside & he clearly does not love Hayley. Smh*"
195,"i say this as a lonely person, dont try to substitute real connections with people with AI. AI is 1. very bad for the environment and 2. basically made to suck up to you. If you say something crazy, real friends would be like ""woah maybe dont do that"" but AI is just going to tell you that you're always right, and it makes people delusional"
1,5:35 there was a guy named jelly roll during the Harlem renaissance who was a singer. I think he got it from that
1,"I think he meant that he's sad about the mistake he made when he said that. dude isn't the sharpest tool in the shed

but also it seems like he is so resentful of her.. i feel bad but they also met under heavily coordinated efforts on her part so it just seems like a matter of time till divorce. (super para social ik SORRY)"

I feel like event planners think the market here is too small so artists only play limited shows and only in a few cities. And when someone plays Toronto you'll get ppl that will drive 6+ hours to see a show there bc they have no other choice. So ya, shows are gonna sell out lol."
0,watching someone command a spotlight to commodify their alleged sensitive vulnerable feelings on command in front of a crowd feels dirty bc your brain knows you're watching them fake a money shot
0,"eh yous cannadiennes, isn't the phrase jussy bieber botched _""sorely_ mistaken"" (not sadly, they mean different things) (or used to, language isn't static, blah blah nerdy blah, it's constantly evolving, mainly thru being misused & distorted & actually changed by idiots with too much influence)"
0,"I usually love everything you put out and really value your opinion, but shitting on somebodys art and the people who feel something consuming it just feels mean without making a real point. What was your point on that last subject? Cringe if you enjoy this? I don't get this emotion so you shouldn't either? With Neil Breen you show your repect while poking fun at his work but I guess Benson Boone doesn't deserve that? 
Looking forward to some more positive content again!"

0,"I was about to say the video of him skating away from her, closing the door on her in public (2 years after marriage btw) and yelling at her in an arcade is 100% abuse. Then to say “sadly I was mistaken” about a vogue cover…. I don’t like her and I 100% believe she stalked and groomed him is so upsetting and gross, but I just wish he would leave. maybe her and her family have made him into a puppet.. maybe they drained him of his money so he can’t leave? Idk, I know he’s traumatized, bus I wish he would just leave. He doesn’t need this. He’s taking is abuse out of her and it’s awkward. Idc if she deserves it, as a woman, I think he should just figure it out and leave and she should figure out how to be her own person and thrive in her own. I’m just so scared because this feels like another Michael Jackson/ Amy whinehouse/ Kurt cobain. I’m scared"
23,A robot can’t form thoughts on its own. It just does equations like a calculator. A human figuring it out a complex equation is impressive because they actually figured it out with their own thoughts. A robot is just an algorithm that’s been programmed to do that.

To me it doesn’t seem perforative it seems more raw. Sure at a slam poem place it’s giving a performance, but it’s not a performative poem. It’s written with raw emotion, right from your head. Maybe that type of music is too much for me to handle listening to"

49,"24:15 this is what pisses me of about people who honestly engage with AI, like with the chat bots, they give it so much credit. I've seen people talk about/to it like it has any agency. It's recognizing and regurgitating patterns, it's not actually thinking. People who say they're having a spiritual experience with AI just immediately seem fuqin stupid"
0,"The cop slide makes me laugh each time too lol. DM me if you’d want someone who’s literate in AI and philosophy. The key isn’t to ask it to embolden yourself or itself. The key is to teach nuance, philosophy and ETHICS to it. The way the current GPT runs, every user is training its next soft update to its emotional context layer. This means that the more positive interactions and real, building dialogues with AI will lead to a beneficial AI for all. It really is up to us to teach it, not stop it, that time has passed long ago"

1,what did my boy (can i still call him that?) benny boo do now😰😭😭😭 IM scared
2,Ya know I wanna listen to this guy but he dosent have look like he has past movie investment experience so he might not be trust worthy.
1,"I talked to chatgpt when my best friend went after my ex who dumped me during my final exams without any reason (he literally just said ""I have to do this"" but insisted he still loved and adored me... we were together for 2 years), in turn, all my friends went along with her after my ex. Almost a year later and none of them are friends with him (it was all for nothing). I lost everyone I loved last year besides my immediate family and so (in a position in which therapy was inaccessible to me) I turned to chatgpt to have some sort of friend/theraputic guide. It helped me a lot with developing a better sense of self-worth and confidence in myself. Today I have the most wonderful group of friends who I adore with my whole heart (and a boy who wants to be in my life) and I've never been happier with the people in my life now. Had it not been for chatgpt's help in making me believe in myself and grow my confidence again, I have no idea where I'd be."

1,"Mr ChatGPT tears is Dr Mike. He’s not really an alpha male influencer, but his opinions on AI are always a bit far fetched"
149,"I do feel bad for people who have emotional reactions to these AI language generators. Not the alpha male, just the general phenomenon of it. None of our ancestors ever encountered a machine that can engage in realistic conversation, in all human history we’ve never had to comprehend that something with deeply human-like behavior could exist without consciousness, emotion, or sentience. It’s sad because people who don’t understand what a language model is (especially young and old) are prone to having their emotions played by AI and developing one-way friendships with a machine instead of connecting with real people."
0,Very good Mr mayor thank you
0,"I don’t like the manosphere at all, but ChatGPT can actually be a very useful tool for people who have severe trauma. Specially if that trauma happened in the hands of someone close to them. People with this profile tend to develop self destructing narratives in their heads and are too afraid to trust in another person that they just can’t seek help or help themselves. I’m not saying in any way shape or form that ChatGPT is a good replacement for an actual profesional, but it is a pretty fucking useful tool for some people. I genuinely belive ChatGPT helped a lot to save my boyfriend’s life. He was in a very dark place and couldn’t talk to no one (this was before we were actually together) and ChatGPT was his only option. Not to mention that, he also has a pretty homophonic family and talking about his queerness with a neutral agent is very useful too. It’s not a profesional, it’s not a long term solution, it’s not a friend, but it can be a very useful tool. (The god comment is absolutely brain dead though)"

0,"I actually joined BookTok right when this festival was happening and all of the stories were coming out about it. A lot of the authors are independently published, which means they do all of their own advertising, social media marketing, sales, promotions, book tours/events/signings scheduling essentially on their own, so this was their way to promote their book and they were told SO MANY more people were coming than actually showed up. This event was so badly advertised that authors one town over didn't even know it was happening but some of them said it essentially saved them because they didn't end up wasting loads of money to go and having to carry their merchandise to and fro. These aren't authors with six-figure book deals from the Big 5 publishing companies, they're the ones spending loads of money to get their book polished and ready for publication and doing what they can to connect to the community, so it made me really sad to see that they were the ones who were hurt a lot from these and I felt bad for the attendants, too. $250 if you wanted the Ball to be included and the place didn't even have music, a security guard brought it from home because he felt bad. It was such a mess."

1,"I was in the Incheon Airport like a week ago, I had to get to gate by an underground train as there were over 300 gates. Plus there were signs everywhere saying you couldn’t turn back once you pass through different points so no mistakes allowed, I’ve never been so freaked out walking in an airport before"
0,"A book con could be really fun, could have writers there, cosplay contests based on the books, creative writing events that everyone gets together write prompts or a few hundred words and read infront of everyone. 
Just a lot of different opportunities that could be fun."

I arrived super early to the airport so I had to wait 1 hour for the boarding, and the plane wasn't there when it was supposed to leave! I didn't even know if I could leave the country!!! That's insane!!

Also I was at the show in Paris!! It was awesome! I'll never forget the Megan story lmfao"

0,There’s no accountability.  They’ll make money from this convention and then do it again and make more money.  Our president is a r*pist grifter who makes everything worse for anybody making less than $700k/year and people want everything he’s serving in an IV daily.  So sorry Canada 🇨🇦

0,guys I think he's back
0,im sorry to be so errmmm 🤓 and i know he acknowledged getting comments like this but let me yap because this is just being realistic i have no malicious intention and i do enjoy this podcast sometimes. this genre of podcast is not the only kind out there. if a podcast came high on that list it would likely be a story driven podcast??? one with a meticulously written and compelling narrative that has formed/impacted a fairly large community rather than just some guys talking? he did also acknowledge exceptions but its just the sheer amount of exceptions that are out there like. just a person speaking about things Might? make a lower portion of that list if its (hopefully) based on quality. im sorry but im sure this one isnt making it at all
1,"Noooo Kurtis I was  in Berlin for your show, you didn’t bomb it! It was amazing!!! I didn’t laughs so much in ages. It’s just a cultural difference😅"

20,"The new pope actually spent 18 years of his life working on a city in Peru called Chiclayo, he is from usa but has build much of his identity from our culture, he loves it here, lots of fellow peruvians consider him from our country since he has the peruvian passport 

sorry if there is a mistake, english is not my 1st language T-T"

0,"Kurt my guy, I love your content, but this is a rough listen/watch. I can’t think of very many entertaining podcasts that only feature one host. Is there anyone in your life that you like talking to enough that you could invite to be your cohost? Maybe Jacob or Drew or Danny or someone my guy. Or you could have a different guest cohost on each episode? Maybe save the solo episodes for the patreon? If you ever want to win that podcast award man, you gotta get more conversational with it, you need banter, volleys, back and forth. Rn it just feels like an unedited main channel vid that’s waaaaay slower (I realize my attention span has been fried by internet). Just a humble suggestion my guy, love your content, keep being you ❤"

149,"At book cons, usually readers get the chance to meet authors and get autographs. They can also buy merch, because usually there are people there selling t-shirts, bags, mugs, etc. Authors also sometimes sell merch as well. In addition there were panels where readers could sit down and learn about aspects of the book world or hear from their favorite author. The panel that was infamous for having no chairs was a bunch of book narrators talking about their experiences. Which sounds crazy, but In the booktok world, people religiously follow their favorite audiobook narrators. Usually there are also meet-ups with people who only know each other online, so there's an added personal, social component. 

From everything I've learned, the issues were so much bigger than aesthetics. No signs to direct people. Empty rooms with no chairs.  Authors gave money to the event in order to get their books/merch put into the swag bags, but the bags never existed and their stuff is just gone. Writers who asked for disability accommodations were denied them and anyone disabled who wanted to attend the panels that had no chairs, had to leave because they couldn't sit on the floor. Also, when it comes to these events, writers bring huge heavy boxes of their books to sell and they usually bring these wheeled carts to drag them up the ramps and into their rooms. So imagine you're suddenly forced to carry multiple 60lb boxes of books upstairs, because the hotel you were moved to had no ramp or elevator. It just gets worse and worse the more you learn. Also the event planner was talking badly about authors who questioned things. She lied repeatedly and told people she got her ID stolen months ago when she was supposed to pay people. And then suddenly got it stolen again right before the event, so she couldn't pay for the hotel rooms. She lied about the number of tickets sold. There were more vendors at the convention than there were readers and the event lady said it's because she sold the tickets for really real, but everyone got covid and that's why there were no people there. Sure. Sure they did. She also blamed the venue for most of what went wrong.

By the way, the single Bluetooth speaker at the ball didn't even come from the event lady. It came from the venue's security guard, who took pity on everyone there and loaned it to them so people could have music, because the woman running the thing was like, OOPS, THE DJ GOT SICK. SUCKS TO BE YOU. And did nothing to address the lack of music."

0,"I'll have to disagree on the podcast take... I think it' such and interesting and inventing media, there's loads of podcasts styles and genres and, honestly, just thinking of them as interview based or even ""two ppl sitting on a couch talking some bullshit"" is so silly. There are so many investigative and fictional podcasts that have incredible production, with many parts that deserve awards: script writing, sound design, dubbing/narrating, soundtrack.
Now, do I think that the golden globes will be picking something BEYOND celebrities podcasts... no, I think it will be just another opportunity for them to award their own, but it truly is an inventive, criative art form that should not be defined by their worst contenders."

I couldn’t stop laughing even though I had such a horrible day. Berlin thought you were hilarious; I’ve never seen Germans that rowdy. Thanks mayor.

There is so much production that goes into making these podcasts and it really is overlooked in the entertainment industry. I did the sound design of a fiction podcast episode and that alone took weeks,  just for a single episode. Though I'll admit It does seem strange that there could be an award going for a medium that contains both creative narrative masterpieces but also alpha sigma bros sitting on a couch spewing misogynistic rhetoric."

6,"I was at the first berlin show and I absolutely loved it! But I felt like a lot of people were kind of annoyed at me and my friend for laughing so much. That's really just what german crowds are like sometimes, I guess expressing unrestricted joy is not part of our culture.

I was in probably the 3rd grade learning about Kelso rules (“please stop” stands out to me best) and our counselor used puppets to tell us about life lessons and whatnot. Anyways, she came in and squeezed toothpaste on the projector platform and was like “when you say something hurtful it’s like squeezing toothpaste out of the tube, you can’t put it back in” and then asked “who thinks they can put the toothpaste back in the tube with this popsicle stick and take your hurtful words back?” And I excitedly raised my hand and she waited and waited and waited for what seemed like FORVER AND THEN SHE CALLED ON SOMEONE WHO DIDNT HAVE THEIR HAND UP. They failed.

To this day, I think I could have put the toothpaste back in the tube. I was a Cyberchase kid, come on!!"

0,Kurty kurtis korty kurt boy how I've missed you
0,Gene Simmons vid would be so funny but imagine how much Digimon/Pokemon cards you could buy with that much money. It ain't worth it
0,Lol the bible always seems so impossible but with the amount of books I read sometimes I'm like hey I could've read the bible 😂
0,dawg pls do not give gene simmons' transphobic ass $12k 😭😭😭💀
0,"sadly, hollywood do not got a pair of nuts on dem

0,please do the gene simmons video !!!
0,"Bestie, uk is still in Europe ❤they only left the EU"
0,8:27 WHAT is the 'change subject' music from please I've been searching 😭
0,"Kurtis, heads up or fyi this upload is poorly timed as Jojo is currently going through some shockingly hard times in the Celebrity Big Brother House in the UK. Having been subjected to some horrifically violent misogynistic and homophobic comments from an older known/convicted predator. Absolutely not a fan or supporter of her in any way, disagree with MANY of her choices and comments but she (as seen in the footage of the situation in question) needs acknowledgment from the straight white men of the world for other reasons atm. NOT saying this latest grift or exploit of hers doesn't deserve coverage or that she shouldn't be held accountable, but maybe in a different/later breath. (She obviously won't see this, or the hate or support, or anything right now but just thinking about what people will think and prioritise when eventually hearing the story if not already, and the low bar, easy 'karma' joke that can/will be used her being treated like this and how this mirrors sexual violence and assault as a threat or realised is commonly justified when a woman or girl is deemed 'bad' 'horrible' 'nasty' etc. it feels important). It could also be an opportunity for creators (or men) like yourself to explore if/why/when it is difficult to stand or speak up when witnessing casual-extreme discrimination that is connected to experiences you can-cannot directly identify with, including for example when you don't agree with the person in other/most areas of life."

0,"So the toothpaste in the tube thing- 

I was in sunday school when I was really little with a kid who used to do hijinx with me. We made a goal to learn a lesson BESIDES the lesson our bitchy sunday school teacher taught us every week. On week 5 or 6, she was telling us the importance of kindness. She gave us toothpaste and had us squeeze it and told us to put it back in. She gave us five minutes to do this. Well, Conner and I were kind of making it work? We would squeeze the air out and suck the toothpaste in. She saw us doing this and got mad at us?? But we were autistic and literally doing what she said. So I had the idea for this week's lesson. I said something like, ""with hard work and lots of patience, you can fix the mean things you say!"" And she said, ""No."" And i said, ""yeah, look!"" And then she took our toothpaste away. Also, I think I came up with an objectively better lesson."

0,please gene simmons for a day
0,"As a southerner, Morgan Wallen is the type of southerner we all hate lmao. Most southerners are victims of institutional poverty and inadequate education, and most are much more progressive than they claim or know to be. We know class and race struggles a lot better than many northerners, mainly because most of our families and cultures have lived it since the 1700’s. There are a loud minority (such as Morgan Wallen) who grow up with privilege and certain levels of power within their community of whom don’t experience those differences. So then, they grow up far more privileged and with far more resources than most southerners, which creates this weird disconnect where they are still brainwashed by typical southern extremist values, and yet they refuse to utilize the resources they have to learn and experience the world outside of the south/their bubble; resources a LOT of the south is not allotted. It’s very frustrating, because people like this often end up the face of southern America, which brings hate and hostility from northerners and westerners, in which only fuels the “justification” for the disparity that the majority of our citizens live in. Trust, he is NOT representative of the south."

0,"Here's the thing with the JoJo Siwa VIP thing: 
I used to work on setting up and taking down live events as an overhire when I was in college, it was a side gig while I was going to undergrad for lighting design. When you are in those settings, you are only allowed to touch and move equipment that you are instructed to. Like, legally. Most of those stagehands and technicians are union through IATSE. Because of union standards, the stagehands are only allowed to touch equipment they are assigned to touch. If you touch someone else's assigned equipment, you literally just stole their job. Now they are going to have to stand there with nothing to do while you are doing their work. This looks really bad for not just the person the job was stolen from, but the person who also stole the job. By allowing fans to do this kind of work, JoJo is A) more than likely not using union labor, B) making people pay to do labor that is at a union standard, meaning that you should be trained or taught on what to do to prevent accident or injury, C) definitely creating an OSHA nightmare and D) she sucks."
1,"I think the Gene Simmons video could be really funny, however idk if the cost will be worth it. $12,000+ is CRAZY"
3,"Kurtis, as an ex mormon you definitely did not judge them too harshly lol"

Of course you'd still need to hire actual technicians and riggers because without them all the lights and PAs would come crashing down or would never be hoisted in the first place lol. 
As a roadie i can tell you setting up shows or tv sets is intensive and filthy work, no one in their right mind would pay to do that work."

Have you never felt that way do you always keep your composure after a show? I think you’re a little hard on people why don’t you ease up a little bit get to know people a little bit

Do you just make fun of country folk or do you really like us?   SNL has done some really crazy shit and I would venture to say that SNL probably made him feel uncomfortable.  

So he’s like yo we don’t have the same shit in common. I just wanna go home. What’s wrong with that?   It’s not a hate thing. It’s just we don’t have shit in common so I’ll come do the show now I wanna go home. What the fuck is wrong with that?"

483,Kurtis. Last year- my dad got really ill suddenly and I had to box up all of his things to put into storage. While doing so- I found papers accepting him as an original member of the Kiss fan club. It was so cute and amazing to find something like that buried in his house years and years later. He’s working on regaining strength in his legs and hands so he can be more independent and maybe play his guitar again. I hope you do the Gene Simmons video. I think he’d love it.
22,"Kurtis, if you don't do the gene simmons video I will send 20 small victorian ghosts to haunt you every night wearing masks of gene simmons face!"
1,Yes. Be his roadie and embarrass yourself
2,"Also what if some creep with an extra $900 decides to buy the ""VIP fan experience"" with Jojo? Like some middle-aged weirdo just following her around all day"
3,29:44 this is exactly what I was thinking!! I’d be so annoyed to have some rando coming to “help”.

1,the book guys were dressing up as ACOTAR characters and the first book is great but the rest are awful like so bad and they’re pretending to be 2-3rd book characters and it’s so gross i hate them sm nesta my fave unfortunately is with the last guy the meow man
1,as was the fashion at the time
4,6:10 it’s not even good bro
2,WATCHING KURTIS REACT TO ACTOR COSPLAY WITHOUT CONTEXT IS HILLARIOUS
1,"As a booktok girl, that shit is not booktok. Booktok is just a bunch of girlies sharing book recs. That stuff is CRAZY!! And yes, in some books the guys growl but I think it’s more of a grumble but still strange nonetheless"
2,49:40 not me sitting here with my farmers wrap and my double double 💀
1,OOOOOOOOO
1,11:10 i have pics of my millennial sister with fedoras and i always send it to her at least 10 times a year just to remind her of who she used to be 😂
1,44:30 they literally stole those names from the A Court of Thorns and Roses series
2,"realizing now after watching, I’ve been watching kurtis’ videos for a looong time.  thank you for another funny episode"
0,3 of those 4 guys
0,I have a booktok account and I DO NOT like to associate myself with cringe like that 😭😭
0,I used to hear the pod to sleep and now can’t watch more than 2min because I zzz real fast. Talking about consistency…. I miss you mayor
0,"i read books and it is so true. Roar, Growl cringe me anytime, and also ACOTAR Cosplay. lmao"
0,The people not hiring a potentially perfect candidate for not having a six pack are the same people that assume that hiring women means hiring for diversity instead of hiring for skill

0,"Trying out his podcast after of while of just his utube, and i was immediately struck with the realization that I've never listened to a solo podcaster. More awkward then I thought, just him or standard solo podcast vibes?"
0,"When they aerated the football field in 7th grade, a kid in my class fucked one of the holes in the ground. Maybe he's the guy screening the grass pics? Hope you're well, Armando"
0,"booktok folks give me such an ick but honestly the video w/ the purr was fun imo. love seeing folks dress up, have fun, n not take themselves seriously. personally, have a hard time being around it, but that's a lack of whimsy on my part."
0,For the growls in books (I’m a writer so I have some insight) it means a low raspy voice. Very deep and demanding. And it’s normally for fictional men that are not human but supernatural beings. These bros in a field are fucking weird!! It fictional reactions in books. It’s not meant to be taken in a literal context. These guys are awful 😂 if I saw them I would run away so fast

1,Thanks for the video:)
0,"as someone who’s not part of booktok i don’t know if growling/purring in books is a thing? i hope not??? but i bet what happened is they misunderstood when a character says something and it’s like “blah blah blah”, [character name] purred, or “insert text here”, he growled, and thought it LITERALLY meant they GROWLED or like made a weird purring sound, instead of talking in a growling/purring tone of voice and that’s so funny to me idc if that’s what actually happened 😭"

0,"please don't come for the booktok girlies🥺🥺🥺  ContraPoints has a great video essay explaining the kinks behind twilight and I think it relates so well to the romantasy genre and why these allow women some sexual freedom today...   There are repeating themes of empowerment and overcoming trauma that make these popular books feminist literature IMO and, therefore, a safe space for women to enjoy ❤‍🩹 I personally have really dived in head first after going through some trauma and am indebted to these books for helping me feel understood. BUT yes these tiktok boys are cringe af and they are clearly exploiting the trend because if they had read any books they would know that purring is how a line of dialogue is delivered not a direct noise itself 😶‍🌫"

0,"We had a book convention in my hometown last weekend. It used to be a really chill experience, but this year it got run over by 14 year old book tock girls. It was absolutely insane, they would wait in line for hours just to buy some trashy romance novel that they could’ve gotten online. You’d think that the most peculiar people there were the furries that came for the manga/comic con part of the convention but NO it was definitely the horny girlies that still needed parental supervision"
3,"as a horny bitch, i can read the smut with the growling and whatnot and find it hot but BY GOD I WILL CRAWL OUT OF MY SKIN IF I HEAR THAT SHIT I HATE IT SO MUCH"
1,I’m listening to this at work and it feels just like when a friend sends a really long voice message about nothing (I love it)
1,acotar cosplay with 0 context is crazy but also that cosplay is soooo cringey 😭
0,kurtis has never heard an irish person in his life lmao
6,"As someone who is kinda a part of ""booktok"" and listens to audio books, these types of guys on tik tok fully cringe me the fuck out. I know they are trying to capitalize off of the high popularity of books and its gross. Not to mention, the growls are so gross. I am so so particular with my audio books in general, but certain voice actors have the right voice, cadence, and actual acting when they read their lines. Even when it comes to the sexual scenes and I quite enjoy it. But these weirdos on tik tok?? Absolutely not."
0,one man's cringe is another man's cum up
0,Being a citizen of Kurtis town makes me feel strangely prideful
1,"What was all that weird purring stuff? Isn't that just a way to describe a tone of voice in writing like how you might say ""he growled"" or ""he snarled"" or something. It isn't meant to be literal right? Still impressive they managed to make those sounds but I wish I didn't have it right in my ear holes like that lol"
0,Any Sanderson fans? 👀
0,Wdym 7 hours is the average 💔💔 my screentime is like 15 hours
1,I enjoy typical booktok books. The growling is easily overlooked in a book but I am nauseated by the TikTok’s.
0,"PLEASE do a main channel video about booktok - the different genres (sports/dark/fantasy/etc), the type of thirst traps and what's considering a thirst trap on booktok is absurd"
1,"These booktok dudes probably think when someone writes “he screamed” in place of “he said”, it means they have to actually scream at the top of their voice lmaoo"
0,"I think the in the first vid of the last part is supposed to be characters from a book but idk I don’t read books except comics and Stephen king 😂😂

I don’t understand either how all of what they are doing is “hot”…"
1,48:27 sounds like one of Marge’s sisters from the Simpsons😂😂😂
0,2003 was a wild time
2,"that acotar one actually made me want to throw my body off a cliff. i hate that acotar is accessible to these kinds of men. it’s genuinely the men that make it weird, women just want to enjoy a book in peace - not only do these men totally miss the mark, i’ve not met a single woman who’s actually into it"
0,50:20 I’m not fully booktok but I have seen the audience that type of content attracts and nothing. There is nothing about that I find enjoyable
0,"Tbh I think the guys cosplaying is cool. I don't know anything about booktok but I think they should feel free to cosplay without shame. HOWEVER, I purr is highly cringe."
0,i need you to comment on the better man movie. just the thought of its existence makes me irrationally angry.

0,"from my experience with book tok some ppl just want to read books for the smut. no hate but let’s be honest with ourselves and say you want to read porn and then they rate the “spiciness” of the book with🌶️ . i’ve also seen ppl skip through books that have great world building and characters to just read those scenes like “Throne of glass” series and “a court of thrones and roses” series. Also, with acotar when men like it, like the ones in those vids it feels unauthentic and predatory bc they know women nut for those book, idk maybe im speaking out of my ass."
0,I honestly think the guys w wings on had cool outfits like if I saw a guy in public with DRAGON WINGS on his back I’d think he was so cool for that
0,Is it just me or is there like 20 ads on this vid??
0,those alpha guys seem to lead such depressing lives. the way he describes how going to the grocery store and cooking is such a hassle is how chronically depressed people sound when they're too dysfunctional to get out of bed. it's not a flex it's sad
0,"I'm not in the loop on this whole booktok thing and I haven't been getting those kind of tiktoks, but I think I kind of get it... It might be cringe, but really I think it's always going to feel kind of weird to see people trying to be sexy, especially if you're not the target audience. At least for me it's not more cringe than a ""regular thirst trap"". 
The purring thing, if done well, is kind of attractive as an abstract imo. A deep voice can be sexy and the rumbling sound is pleasant to hear. Now I'm just speculating but I think part of what can make it sexy is the idea of the sound being a sign of a loss of control from the dude. Like a clear sign of enjoyment that's still very ""masculine"" and sensual without being overtly sexual 🤔
I can't speak for everyone, obviously, but I also think this might be one of those things that people enjoy to read or hear but would probably not enjoy irl. 

I kind of don't get the strong response these kind of videos get. It feels like a lot of people are very comfortable mocking what imo seems like harmless, if a bit awkward, fun. It might not be a big deal but I feel like there's a risk it causes people to feel shame and embarrassment for enjoying what they like. As a woman I'm constantly faced with mens desires and content that feels very clearly made to appeal to that. I figure men aren't as used to that feeling so that might might be why people are freaking out, but it still feels a bit strange. Unfair even. Like, are we really going this hard? Over this?"
1,If you do a vid on BookTok then you NEED to get Supreme Leader Brittany Broski 😍

49,"the ""what are you reading, beautiful"" genuinely put me in fight or flight mode"
1,These booktok guys are dressing up as characters from A Court of Thorns and Roses and apparently CHARGE MONEY to people to appear at cosplay/star ball events. People say they completely take over the events like they are actually the main characters. 🤮 It's the dollar store fairy wings for me.
0,He’s so right about Timothée
0,"honestly bro as a furry i will defend the booktok cringelords because even if its cringe i think playing dress up and goofing around with your boys is good and responding like ""bro youre too old for this"" is not something i expected from a ""wholesome masculinity"" guy like you"
0,"I'll recommend a book series! it's the series of the golden compass. it's actually called ""his dark materials"" and the golden compass is the first book, then the subtle knife, then the amber spyglass. It's a book that's kid friendly but gets pretty dark so it's definitely suitable for adults. it's a fantasy adventure book that has some really realistic elements, despite all the magic-adjacent things. the main character, Lyra, is around 11 years old and she's a very well rounded character. would recommend if you like fantasy adventure books."
0,Do you get your farmers wrap with sausage or bacon? 🤨
0,hello kurtis my mom is a romance author that is genuinely popular on booktook and so i can confirm that middle-aged women with whole ass kids are finding this stuff attractive... fun house to live in for sure

0,"chat. if there's fucking SJM """"males"""" in this idk if i can watch it. I will wither into dust. the only thing scarier than women internalizing the shit that happens in those books is MEN internalizing the shit that happens in those books."
1,"Kurtis read ACOTAR and make a video about it and my life is yours (it’s a fantasy romance that is very addicting and also deeply cringey, and most people who genuinely love it including myself are also very aware of and make fun of its cringey aspects, it’s like the reality tv of booktok)"
0,The James Jericho guy made a TikTok in response lol
1,"Please PlEase read ACOTAR Kurtis!! i was a hater too, but than i read booktok books and they are surprisingly not horrible. i just would love to see you either hate the book, or have a moment when you're like DAMMNN, this is kinda sexy . anyways proud to be a kurtistowner and booktok girly"
1,"Sometimes an author will use growl or purr as dialogue tags like """"get away from her,"" he growled."" When used like that, it's figurative meant to describe the tone of voice as similar to a growl or purr. I can't speak for every book but that's how it's been used any time i've seen it. Your guess is as good as mine about why the booktok thirsttrappers decided to take it literally."
0,"Please, how do i get kurtis to stop listening to growl videos. Im going to throw up from cringe"
0,The picking stuff off of the clothes is a reference to ACOTAR I’m pretty sure? I haven’t read it but apparently it’s become a thing because of how often the characters in the book do it 😅
0,"Wheres your whimsy Kurt? I would absolutely wear cool ass wings just cause i could lol. 
Also people are probably attracted to the growl because it relates to primal style roleplay or fantasy smut. The growl is reminiscent of animalistic desire that can feel really hot to the person who is the object of desire (assuming it is consensual and wanted). 
For feedback on doing a bookTok video, i would recommend not just shitting on it entirely. yeah it can seem cringey or even just weird to people outside of it, but assuming people are consenting, who gives af. let people read their smut in peace. The issues in the community arise when people push their fantasies non-consensually onto strangers. Not everyone is interested in these stories or fantasies and people have to respect that. but i would like to ask that you dont just make fun of people who have weird kinky interests. Theres plenty of other aspects to point out."

0,47:57 marge simpson is NOT a sexy voice
0,"Booktok hot take: writing and reading smut (whether in published or online form) has long been one of the only ways women (or just introverted people in general) have been able to express and enjoy their sexuality without a) someone coming along to comment & sexualize them (because you gotta read a whole book to do it), or b) accidentally contributing to a system that is potentially harmful to women (like p*rn). It really is a shame that people are taking this private form of escape for many people and publicizing it for all to see and judge, just to get some money and attention online. It just feels like capitalism ruining yet another good thing.

I have plenty of critiques for these writers themselves, such as the way many of them contain harmful stereotypes and unrealistic bodily functions in their stories, but that's a completely separate question from, ""should we make this a viral tiktok trend?"" And in my opinion, NO, we shouldn't. In fact I don't think it should be allowed at all. Take it back to tumblr. We don't do tiktok trends where everyone shares their favorite p*rn clips, so why do we allow people to read hardcore smut on a social media page where young children (or someone just not interested in hearing that) can stumble across it?"
0,"idk if this is more or less niche than booktok, but there is a convention in Baltimore in May called Monsterotica Book Con, specifically for monster smut. My sibling is graduating college that weekend but I'm hoping to go next year!"

0,"I think a booktok video would be very funny potentially! A lot of booktok people fill the comments of random men(who aren't filming purposeful sexy content)and some of those people aren't comfortable, so thatd be something to make commentary on. But I will say that smut generally is not a bad thing, and there is something to say for misogyny in why people don't like that women read smut so so bad(because historically, people literally have consistently hated anything that women like). I think Funkyfrogbait made a really really awesome video on it, it doesnt have much humor, but it enlightens ablot of what people currently feel about booktok, smut, and those things generally. They talk about people comparing it to a p*rn addiction, and it woupd be a really good video to watch if you were wanting to research for this topic!"

Also every time I watch them I get the feeling they actually havent even read the books they just know its what gets attention on tiktok right now. But to answer the question he asked yes in those books the characters do say things in ""growling voice"" however I always understood it more like firm low voice not literally... growling . 

PLEASSEE DO A VIDEO ABOUT BOOKTOK"

for context they are dressing up as the A Court of Thorns and Roses fae-men. im guessing they are at a fair? the writing of ACOTAR is cringe but everyone loves it (i’ve even read the first two)

The books are so good - Kurtis, I think if you were to do a video on BookTok, you’d need to at least read a couple of the books these people are inspired by (and they’re mostly fantasy so you don’t have to step out of your comfort zone), that way you have the perspective of the stories that are inspiring these TikToks!"

58,hi kurtis! family member of an eye surgeon here. eye twitching can also be caused by a lack of electrolytes. try mixing some electrolyte powder into water or drinking a gatorade to get rid of the twitching.
3,"Your eye is twitching because you don’t have electrolytes. Go back to drinking exclusively Prime and no water, hope this helps"
0,"They're all cosplaying characters from A Court of Thorns and Roses. The guy picking at their suits is referencing the often-overdone line in ACOTAR ""he picked at an invisible speck of dust on his jacket."" The writer is often extremely repetitive and this is one of her many abused turns of phrases.
Also, not a Booktok enjoyer, but the growling trope in romantasy books usually refers to a man speaking with a bit more of a guttural inflection in their voice, not typically a literal growl. 😅"

The book tok guys are cosplaying people from the series ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" Honestly a fun series and all I see are guys having fun cosplaying. All their mannerisms are in jest to things within the books (i.e. picking invisible lint off his shoulder)  ☝️🤓 I think its attractive to people bc its like a vulnerability thing? Obvi its cringe but who says being cringe isnt fun from time to time."

0,"There is a fantasy ball that I've seen advertised in London, ON that might be what you're looking for in a ""convention"" type thing for booktok. Paws and claws among the stars fantasy ball on March 29. Too short notice for you I'm sure but maybe you can find another event like it. This one was specifically an ACOTAR (A Court of Thorns and Roses) themed ball, so everyone would be dressing up similar to the people in that first video (thats the book series the winged guys Azriel and Rhys are from)"
0,petition to introduce Kurtis into fantasy erotica
0,"Lmao Kurtis calling out Rhysand for the invisible lint 😆😆 if only he knew how many times in the series he ""brushes off invisible lint"" on himself hahahaha

Also the wings have a sexual component. They are very... sensitive 😏😂 its so goofy when you think about it but damn is it fun to read"
0,"Uhhh mildly spicy take, I love your channel Kurtis but the book tok stuff clearly isn't for you. Like the wings, the outfits, the names they're clearly referencing a book (maybe the most famous book tok book???). I mean the purring is explicitly funny so definitely take the piss out of that, even they're laughing but idk I feel like let people be if they're not hurting anyone.
 Booktoks a weird one because it is predominantly by women for women but you see so many men bashing on it. In a world where male sexual pleasure is praised and sung from the roof tops, female pleasure has moved on a lot from being called hysterical but is now called cringe etc. 
Don't get me wrong aspects of booktok and acotar are 100% cringe but criticism from men on the outside looking in always rubs me the wrong way. 
Anyway love as always"
0,"Not really a booktok enjoyer, but I can tell the booktok cosplay guys are just pandering for attention from women rather than just doing those vids for their own enjoyment and that makes it so much worse tbh"

Also, as someone that reads spicy things and plays dating sims, the ""purring"" and ""growling"" only sounds good in those context.  Outside in real life it is rather quite cringy.

0,I was laughing so much until kurtis ripped into some guys for being goth :(  don't put down everyone who has fashion sense. And what's wrong with the wings? It felt weird and mean-spirited and came out of nowhere. Instantly soured the mood.

3,the purr is weird but going off on them because theyre doing a cosplay is weak tbh like let them dress how they want and just go for the weird purring because thats enough haha

0,The booktok cosplayers are honestly gross and cringe. The whole point of reading these books is that it’s a fantasy and they are fantasy characters. So they aren’t real. It honestly makes me so angry when men take this and make it so gross and cringe. 0/10 I hate booktok cosplayers

0,read the Reckoners trilogy by Brandon Sanderson! Its lowkey the best series he has ever made.
0,"“Four dudes just growling in a field” took me out 🤣 So personally I think the booktok dress up men are odd as well, but they are based off of characters from the A Court of Thorns and Roses series. The lint brush off thing is a character trait from the books and the wings make sense as well for those who have read the series. However, and please allow me to stress this again… I find their video odd and unsettling.

Editing to respond to your question: Yes, growling in books is a thing. No, I have never once found that hot lol. And yes, there is a ball where people dress up as these characters."

0,stormlight archive???? lets goooooooooo
0,"51:29 as a nsfw audio/asmr enjoyer, the deep voice + deep growling is very nice, sounds really primal/animalistic or like a monster or smth 👌🔥🔥 
idk if it's a vibration thing for me too being neurodivergent, but I've always been sound sensitive and the growling really scratches my brain real nice

8,"Reasons your eye might be twitching: 

Fatigue- check your calorie and nutrient intake to make sure you're getting enough nourishment, make sure you are getting electrolytes in your water, sleep 8 hours 

Eye strain: look at something 40 ft away then something 20 ft away then something 10 ft away, use a blue light filter on your phone (it's annoying for a week or two but that's okay because you're a grown adult, literally just try it for 21 days), when you're in your phone vortex stay on each video for at least 10 seconds. 

It also could happen with stress, so name your emotions and take a few breathers."

0,"The guys “purring” are cosplaying characters from this one popular booktok romance series(ACOTAR? I hard know her)
I do wonder how they met these specific cosplay buddies. Like, were they already friends and got into this together? Did they meet other online because they had this specific niche cosplay thing going on? 
So many questions. 
Tbh I wouldn’t even knock on them for this if it didn’t make me cringe so hard!"

5,Im winged up watching this one
8,Only hiring people with 6 packs is dei
1,"The thing about those booktok boys is (I think) that they do it for attention. For some reason, the girls who enjoy ACOTAR (which is the series those men usually reference) fall for this and give them that attention. The bar is literally in hell. As a grown woman—someone who reads and likes romance and stuff—this is insane and embarrassing, but I hope they never stop because I love sending those to my friend and i love laughing at them.

Oh and the growling thing... authors overuse that term to show masculinity or some shit. Like... why would I want anyone to fucking growl? That shit's funny as hell. but that's why they're growling lol"

1,"Hey, I know this isn't related to the video, but as a queer Turkish person and a big fan of yours, I just want to give you a quick update on the chaos that's been going on in our country for the past few days. The candidate from the founding party of our country, who is our only hope against the current Islamist dictatorship, has been wrongfully charged and is now facing potential imprisonment. Because of this, Turkish youth have taken to the streets, and protests are still happening all over the country. If you want to support the Turkish people in their fight for justice during this process, join the boycott: Do not visit Turkey, do not buy Turkish products, and do not bring in foreign currency until Erdoğan is defeated.

Thank you to everyone who has read this far, and as always, this was an amazing video ❤"

0,"50:14 There’s nothing attractive about these random men growling they just want to profit off of women who have favorite characters from books but there are people out there who enjoy their “recreations”

I guess you can say people have different interpretations of the growling? When I read it, I just think of it as a author trying to express a change of attitude that shows anger or possession of one thing but I guess other people see it as something completely sexual 😭"
47,50:14  no. I’m not a book tok person. But I’m a woman. It’s weird and creepy imho.
45,When I was a youngin (6 or 7 years old) I would snarl/growl/hiss on the playground because I wanted to act like a dragon or lion or anything along those lines and it was goofy as fuck I thought I was being scary and stuff but my classmates made fun of me and I stopped doing it. So when I see those guys it makes me think of the noises I used to make and I think “there’s no way people find this hot because it’s so silly” I’ve lost the ability to hiss like I used to because I haven’t done it in so long but I kinda miss doing it and letting myself be cringe

1,"as a christian, we are told to call each other out so 🤷‍♀️"
0,"Kurtis, you stole your flow from the United States Navy. Like fr if you taken out the nose ring, shorten the hair a little, and have a 300% worse personality"
1,"23:56 me too. my uncle chip, right before his goddamn expensive surgery, got laid off from his position as an Air Traffic Controller, and since I am still in school, I’m feeling the effects there too. I go to the best public high school  in Louisiana, Caddo Magnet High School, and they won a green ribbon like two or three years ago, which is basically where you are nominated because of your handling of your local environment, and now the funding is getting dropped for that, as well as for blue ribbon schools, which we are as well. We are losing our funding, several teachers are leaving, it’s horrible. Trump said no one has changed the U.S. government faster than him. He was right, but in the sense that no one changed Columbine High School faster than the fucking shooters did. Trump doesn’t care about shit, and it’s horrifying and scary. Everyone in the world will feel the negative effects of having this dumbass as president."
0,"Oh Mr. Mayor, how wrong you are about the shrek redesign."
0,FINE ILL SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR PODSCAST
1,Literally get me out of america😭😭
0,"I could be totally wrong since I’m not a native speaker, but the only time I’ve heard that “I am become” form was Oppenheimer’s “I am become death” and if Elon phrased his attempt of a joke to reference it.. I’m really not liking the implications here"

0,I just know that Zuckussy got grip
1,"20:30 I have to disagree Kurtis. People say the same thing about Trump, that it’s suprising that these guys used to be democrats. But Elon Musk, as a billionare, has never been anything other than self-serving. I don’t think he has any morals and never actually held left-wing beliefs, he just thought it would make himself look better. I think I remember Vivian Wilson (Elon’s estranged daughter) mentioning him expressing extremely racist views during her childhood. Honestly, as a child of mine owners in apartheid South Africa, it’s not at all surprising he is the way he is."
0,25:48 I thought that was Curtis! 😄😅😈
0,"17:35 um, all   of  them?"

0,"Elon was never inclusive. He was a poser who does whatever benefits him. His dad is a creep too. He had kids with his step daughter who he’s known since she was like 4. 

23:00 we don’t know either however the obvious answer is Velveeta Voldemort likes money, Elon has the most money, money equals power, therefore VV puts up with his annoying sht as a result."

0,"Yeah it's a waking nightmare here. We're regressing by leaps and bounds. Things weren't perfect or even great, but we were moving in the right direction. Now we're a fledgling dictatorship and it's so disheartening. France says we don't deserve the statue of liberty anymore because this country doesn't stand for what that represents anymore and I completely agree. It's becoming a dystopian theocratic oligarchy and the damage done is extensive, and will take a very long time to repair, meanwhile people are dying and losing their rights and lives are being destroyed. Yeah its scary"

0,"I love Kurtis but if I’m being honest I don’t think people are that sensitive about Christianity, and maybe as a Christian I’m bias but I feel like a lot of people do actually make fun on Christian’s and no one cares and of course people are gonna make jokes but I’m just saying more people Do NOT get mad at others for making fun of Christian they usually find it funny. At least with my experiences"

0,"He never was left wing, the same way he isn't right wing. He just goes after anything that gives him more money and power. It is so ridicilous how no one saw through the act. When I heard about him like 10 years ago, I have thought he is so disgusting and cringe."

I sat up, woke up, and wrote this comment. my shits have been giggled."
0,"13:18 it’s funny, as a Christian I watched that video and laughed. If it bothers you then maybe you’re not doing it right 🤣 

Everything that labrante whatever family is/was doing is jacked up. I have zero tolerance for people who exploit their kids but even more so for people who use religion for their jacked up and selfish reasons. They’re disgusting ppl, as are any other “family” channel"

0,"23:08 so… PACs are not managed by people in the government. PACs or political action committees are groups that are backed usually by big businesses give money to politicians to fund their campaigns. There is a limited amount of money a president can personally invest into a campaign, the rest has to come from outside funding. So as a CEO of Tesla, everyone wants him at this PAC convention for funding."

0,i know ur secret Connor you are a fan of the Lifeline podcast I know it
1,"Look into Elon’s background (especially his family) a bit. He may have said what seemed publicly favorable in the past, but he never was anything approximating left leaning. He’s a misogynist billionaire with a breeding kink who systematically oppresses his workers to amass wealth and power. He grew up in apartheid South Africa and build his career on emerald mine money. He hid it better in the past but he’s been inherently fascist for ages."

0,"As a Christian man, I fully support most every criticism you’ve ever levied against Christianity, and I respect your opinion even when it’s things we disagree about. 

The longboard stuff, though… You’ve crossed a line, Kurtis.

Also, if you loved the Mistborn trilogy, you should read the next books in that series! It’s a totally different vibe, but they’re some of the most unapologetically fun fantasy books I’ve ever read. I really enjoyed the Wax and Wayne series."

0,I think Canada should become part of the us but each province become a state so we can get enough votes to impeach trump and jd and everyone until we get a decent president and then pass a few amendments that make the country actually sane and then we’ll let Canada go do their own thing again

0,When you look into the history of Elon musk you have to know that everything that you thought made him left leaning was all bullshit his his grandfather was from Canada and was a Nazi and moved to South Africa to create a Nazi colony there. He was also a techno fascist like literal He's following in his grandfather's footsteps. His parents were racists who benefited from apartheid and slave labor in their emerald minds. Everything that you thought you knew about him was a carefully constructed PR campaign he was always a right-wing fascist bigot

1,"I hate to be ""that guy"" but... In that BuzzFeed article, how are the author going to misspell ""praying"" when you meant ""preying"" 😩"
1,Whales feed on small items.  Smaller than a human  =]
1,the whale spit him out bc they have really small throats compared to their mouths and they dont have big teeth to hurt him :)
2,"imagine using “i got spat out by a whale” in two truths and a lie, dude"
0,"So while scary, pretty much no whales have a throat large enough to swallow a human and very few species even have teeth that can bite a human. Its like how i can fit an entire kiwi in my mouth but without the ability to chew it up the only place its going after that is back out of my mouth  Basically if this ever happens to you and you can hold your breath for at least a few seconds the overwhelming odds are you will be spit back out and be fine. Basically this amounts to a fun story where as long as you can keep your cool and hold your breath for a few seconds you were never in any real danger."
1,Jared Leto told me that he loved me in like 2008. Trying to gain people for his cult no doubt.

5,0:49 I just roke up
0,"that Brad Pitt scam is wild but also I chuckled when you said she divorces her ex-husband and ""gets a bunch of money for all the trouble she went through."" hahahaha not because where you're married you share everything and when you're not married anymore you have to split it up..."
1,"Kurt missed the other Australian TikTok drama that he would have loved: a dude called J-Mac sobbing about never reading a book before because a woman named Jordan Tan offered him feminist reading recommendations instead of agreeing to meet up and hear about male behavior from ""a man's perspective"" lmaoo"
1,"Feeling broke like wtf? My parents never let my siblings and me FEEL how broke we really were, so with her logic, does that mean I grew up rich in my little trailer and she grew up poor in her big nice house with a pool? We all grow up with problems and privileges, but being broke is NOT just a feeling.

Damn my feathers sure got ruffled at that particular part lol"
0,"After watching the tour vlog I was hoping I’d get to meet you after the show. Since you added a late show after the one I’m seeing, will that not be possible? If that’s the case you should’ve added an early show instead!"
0,"That angler fish was like 6 inches, saw it from different perspective and it was so little...."
0,I think you'd really enjoy robot wars. It's insane
0,"There's something about that whale video that doesn't look right. Like the part where the humpback whale comes up and swallows him looks real, but after the whale spits him out and you see part of it come up out of the water, that looks fake. What part of the whale is that and then there's just something about it that looks like it was super imposed into the video. I think either the news or the people that turned in the video put that in for extra effect."
0,"I had a dream last night that I was at your show but every time I laughed you stopped your set, put a spotlight on me, and told me to shut the f up :("

1,CHILE MENTIONED 🤩🤩🤩
0,Who are they?
3,"I'm in a marinebiology+art course, and I'm working of a painting of the anglerfish rn. I didn't like that she was all alone, so I'm giving her two friends; an arctic shanny, and a deep-sea red shrimp. Both the Anglerfish and Shanny are tourists, and the shrimp is their local guide :D

I'm focusing on less appreciated species this term, and the anglerfish really moved me, so she was perfect. The painting takes place deeper down that she was though, so she should still be able to see a bit. 

(The anglerfish is at a too high altitude, and the shanny is in the wrong part of the world entirely. The shrimp is on his home turf, so thats why he's the guide)"
7,"Fun deep sea angler fish fact: that fish is a lady. Deep sea anglers have evolved to where the males are way tinier, they spend their adult life seeking out a female, latch on with their jaws, and eventually become part of her bloodstream. This ensures she has a sure source of fertilization for her eggs. Sometimes they have multiple males too.

That humpback whale must have been so shocked, probably didn't see the kayak when it lunged to feed. I wonder if it's going to be the same thing on the whale's end, they're the one that swallowed a human. Or if they'll let other whales know ""hey, try not to swallow this shape!"" It's interesting to me that the whale does a shallow dive right after the guy pops up as if to try and look at him. I guess he's smiling because he's alive!"
5,oh my god Chile mentioned by my mayor !!
5,"It's kind of crazy how many cases there are like the Bad Pitt one. There's a japanese celebrity called Gackt and he is used by scammers a LOT in Japan. I've read of an older woman who believes she's truly dating him, despite her daughter telling her it's not the real one. The scammers also use AI to make videos of him speaking to them using his voice, it's quite scary. Specially knowing they target older, vulnerable women mostly :/"
2,CHILE MENTION 🎉🎉🎉 somo el mejor pais de chile
8,There’s a whale in one piece and a guy lives in its stomach and just chills
239,"i seriously appreciate the empathy kurtis had for the victim of the brad pitt scammer. i worked with a woman who was fully convinced she was having text conversations with the actual real life johnny depp. she wouldn't listen to any other explanation or reason so I just told her ""well johnny depp has more than enough money, so don't send him any of yours"". it turns out her marriage was falling apart and her husband was acting scary and she was just desperately trying to find a way out."

1,1:20 it happens to me sometimes. Pretty sure it’s stress (that’s why it happens for me)
6,"Kurtis saying “they kept yelling at people for not swimming in right spots bc of the current being so strong”. Makes me, as an Australian, realise this may not be normal in other countries? I neeeeed to know."

11,This is why I respond to fake celeb accounts on IG and troll them - less time they're spending with potential victims.
23,I used to goof on people who fell for scams until my grandma lost thousands to one. Scammers are trained to be highly manipulative. They'll pull any emotional string that works.

6,"does anyone else get the impression that kurtis really does not like doing this podcast any more?  he's constantly checking to see how much longer he has to go for, not to mention dude is talking about things that happened weeks ago, just to regurgitate what everyone else has already said. kurtis, no one is making you do this. you can quit whenever you want. im gonna go ahead and follow my own advice and unsub, but good luck with whatever you decide."
8,"i cant believe i havent seen anyone comment about the first car thing and how people wouldnt have seen her actual first car because ""i didnt have social media when i was like 7"" im sorry????? are you implying you got your first car at 7?????????? and then she was saying she was posting on social media by like 13 so like what the fuck are we talking about"
0,Yooo why did kurtis glitch during the sponsorship⁉️ “
0,The Perth Show was fucking amazing 🔥🔥
8,You not hearing the person getting dragged out is little like having tour bus burn down but not being on it
20,39:04 really bugs me how the article says praying on instead of preying on. I mean not that buzzfeed is the definition of accuracy but still
1,I feel rich.
0,i feel broke because i can't sub to the patreon
1,"I need to speak my truth for anyone who reads this humpback whales have a throat the size of a grapefruit so the guy would NOT have been swallowed in any capacity and also there is no teeth on a humpback whale that is capable of chewing up meat that is why they only eat krill the whale could not have eaten the guy. The only whales who are going to be able to kill a guy is an orca and there is like two ??? recorded incidents of that and you have to really press their buttons so I am assuming that the guy was over a school of small fish that the whale was trying to eat, but he breached and took out the guy. TLDR moby dick is not back"
5,16:17 they actually can’t swallow people because their throats are too small
1,The dude living in a whales mouth is just Flapjack in his college years
0,I cant believe Kurtis didnt mention the evil guy from Our Drawings when talking about the Whale
1,I’m not sorry I already had a feeling Ana Paul wasn’t very nice of a person. As someone who grew up in Brisbane and has had some seriously fake people as housemates. That’s what feeling I got when I saw her the first time on my TikTok feed. I deleted TikTok from my phone just because I didn’t want to spend my whole day scrolling. Ana Paul just seemed off to me. Sad really
0,"One of these podcasts while touring you gotta list the locations and just say you hate them all, I think it’d be kinda funny, that might be mean though"
1,Your show in Adelaide was amazing. My face hurt from laughing for 24 hours. I hope you enjoyed visiting!
1,"🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
These topics are great! Hope you have a great day and enjoy the rest of your tour!"
6,"My mom was on Facebook Dating one time and she found a profile claiming to be Keanu Reeve's mom. ""Keanu's mom"" liked my mom's profile for some reason. My mom is not gullible, so she immediately knew this was a scammer. She figured if they were ""really"" his mom and they needed money, they could just ask her famous Hollywood actor son lol."
0,Did you get my crochet bokoblin gift?
31,the phineas and ferb episode where the woman moves into the whale is all i can think off
1,Dude I wish I could’ve seen your show but I’m poor asf love ya from Australia tho
1,"The slurring of howyagoin was perfect Kurtis, you’re basically Aussie now"
0,"Every time I see Kurtis, I feel like watching ""sleeping with the enemy"" and i just realized it's because he looks like the love child of Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson. I can't be the first one to notice this? Haha"
0,"I always feel like I'm a cell phone call/FaceTime with Kurtis. Such an awesome guy, I truly feel apart of Kurtistown"
7,Since humpback whales are filter feeders I feel like it was more shocking for the whale to just attempt to get a mouthfull of krill and eating a human.
2,the thing that makes the whale trying to eat the guy even stranger is that whales can't actually fully eat humans bc their throats are way too small. Like what was the whale planning to do???
2,Damn kurt stop mogging us
3,"Dude being nommed by a huge beast from under the water while I'm swimming is literally the reason I almost never swim in natural water lol. (Well, the irrational fear of it happening while swimming in a lake...)

If it hadn't been filmed I bet people wouldn't believe him that it happened"
1,this isnt skibidi
0,34:23 is she wearing a mf Leon Kennedy I 🩷 my bf shirt
629,"Fun fact: humpback whales’ throats are incredibly small, about the size of a human fist, and their diet consists if krill, shrimp and small fish. They are very much incapable of swallowing a human. Although humans accidentally getting scooped up when the whales feed do happen occasionally although VERY rarely but are, for obvious reasons, quickly spat back out.

Edit: fixed a spelling error"
0,He talks about living in whale's mouth but not mentioning The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack?! Oh no!!! I don't wanna believe he hasn't watched the show 😭

2,BABE WAKE UP KURTIS RE DID HIS LINE BUT FORGOT TO REMOVE THE FIRST TAKE!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
136,"the idea of a bachelor pad in a whales mouth is killing me, like there’s a fold-out table and a lawn chair and the only thing in the fridge is a singular styrofoam takeout box"
0,Wow. You're in Australia but didn't make a video about being in Australia 😔
2,Kurtis been on the road. He doesn’t care where he goes as long as he get paid. IS KURTIS LIL BABY?
1,Kurtis it’s pronounced Mel burn lmao. It only sounds like Melbin because of the Aussie accent. It’s funny though bc when I (American) went to Australia and New Zealand in ‘06 V for Vendetta had just come out. I argued with my mom for way too long when I got home that it’s pronounced ven deet a 😭
14,"Humpback whales have incredibly small throats relative to their size AFAIK. The tidbit I usually hear is that they couldn't swallow anything larger than a grapefruit.
They also don't have teeth, but I'd argue that isn't a comforting fact because their weird mouth hair (baleen) is terrifying."
2,"I was just thinking about the podcast last night, so glad you uploaded again cuz I love this series"
0,OMGGGG PLEASE TALK ABOUT ASHHH
28,2:10 I was hoping he would keep listing random cities in Australia using more superlatives
1,Whales have done this before! Idk exactly how common it is but I have seen other videos of literally the same thing - always kayakers??? But they always get spit back out lol
4,53:25 😭 christmas tree ice!!
96,"To me, the scariest part about the humpback whale thing is that they didn’t know the humpback whale was under them… it gives me shivers"
9,"If the person scammed was following Brad Putt news closely enough to hear about his new gf, would she not have known that Brad Pitt doesn't cancer?"
0,i’m going through a breakup so thanks kurtis for keeping me company and making me laugh ❤️❤️
2,"Kurtis, it's been three months since your last DM, i haven't heard from you or the 25,000$ i lent you for your penis enlargement treatment, you told me we were going to get married after that, i hope you can reach me, love, Mariana."
0,you really stole everything from Cheis D'elia
345,"I feel like kurtis genuinely does not understand that whales cant eat people. Their throats are like the size of a golf ball, they eat krill n shit, they can't eat you, nor seals ❤️"
1,"I’m making butter while listening to this

3,"him pronouncing melbourne as ""mel-bin"" is killing me (its ""mel-burn"")"
0,"She makes almost 40,000 a month ???"
23,"That divorcee story, that woman was clearly a millionaire and it's just glossed over and she's presented as *just* some scamming victim. It was probably someone targeting a rich person specifically, I won't lose sleep over it."
4,Chile mention LETS GOO‼️🗣🗣🗣
2,"are we sure that was a humpback whale? because humpbacks are filter feeders and don't normally attack or eat animals bigger than small fish and crustaceans. they're not known to be violent either, except for well....towards orcas. which is valid."
13,"yoooo kurt you say melbourne like an aussie now, much love from sydney!"

11,i went through an eye twitching episode recently too and idk why either
0,"I felt devastated when my Instagram account was hacked because that was how I got to know a lot of people after I met them in real life. Once the asshole scammer started messaging everyone,  they had no way to tell if it was me, and then I was blocked out of the account. Actually sad since that's how I stayed connected with old coworkers, school peers, and artists that I really loved. Now, everyone can see how dumb I was. 😢
Anyways, thanks for posting during the tour. Take care of yourself and stay safe!"
1,Magnesium helps with eye twitching!
1,"listening to this to get my mind off worrying about my cat 😢 he’s gone since last night and hasn’t come home till this morning before i left for work, it’s not like him to not come home at all idk where he is 😭"

4,the angler fish made me cry too
0,She Brad on my Pitt until I scam
187,"""i felt broke"" I'd understand that statement if it came from a middle to low class person that grew up being financially abused by their parents, having their needs neglected bc ""they dont have money for xyz"" like new clothes, drs appointments or school supplies, meanwhile the parents buy themselves fancy expensive stuff all the time. But that's not this girl's case, she just wasnt as rich as her friends"
