# Do Female YouTubers Receive More Negative Comments Than Male YouTubers?

## Introduction
For my COMP400 project I chose to look into if female YouTubers receive more negative comments than male YouTubers by doing a literature review as well as a replication/improvement of methodologies. 

The final paper found [here](https://github.com/graceyuz/COMP400/blob/main/COMP400-Final-Paper.pdf) provides the full literature review, an explanation of methodology, and the results of the study.

## Repository Organization
This repository includes all information for the project:
* The final paper is found [here](https://github.com/graceyuz/COMP400/blob/main/COMP400-Final-Paper.pdf)
* The Python script which pulls and stores the YouTube comments is found [here](https://github.com/graceyuz/COMP400/blob/main/comments-to-spreadsheet.py)
* The Python script which evaluates the sentiment of the YouTube comments is found [here](https://github.com/graceyuz/COMP400/blob/main/spreadsheet-to-VADER.py)
* All comment data used in the study is found [here](https://github.com/graceyuz/COMP400/tree/main/Comment-Data). This comment data is organized by YouTuber, and each YouTuber has two CSV files:
    * A file titled `YouTuber-Name_comments.csv` where the results from `comments-to-spreadsheet.py` are stored
    * A file titled `YouTuber-Name_VADER.csv` where the results from `spreadsheet-to-VADER.py` are stored

## Dependencies
For the separate Python scripts, each has different dependencies:
* `comments-to-spreadsheet.py` depends on `google-api-python-client` to access YouTube comments
* `spreadsheet-to-VADER.py` depends on `vaderSentiment` for sentiment analysis

In order to use `comments-to-spreadsheet.py`, you must have a valid YouTube Data API v3 key stored as an environment variable. Set the variable like this:
    `API_KEY='your-api-key-here'`

## Acknowledgements
The included comment data was retrieved via the YouTube Data API v3. All data is publicly available, and no user-identifiable information has been included, in accordance with YouTubeâ€™s API Services Terms of Service.

Portions of this code were inspired by public examples of YouTube Data API usage. No code was copied, and all logic was implemented independently.
